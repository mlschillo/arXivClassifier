#Classify scientific abstracts into their subfields

In this project I fine-tune a pre-trained bert model to achieve this goal.  To get more details about the methods, goals, and results, check out Blog.md or see the post on [Medium](https://marjorie-loganschillo.medium.com/dear-theoretical-physics-if-we-pass-each-other-on-the-street-in-10-years-will-we-even-recognize-7611bb8c5a0a).

To see more details about my specific classification experiment, see Code/Notebooks.  

To do your own experiment, download the packages in Code/src and see Code/Notebooks/PackageDemo for a quick-start demonstration.
