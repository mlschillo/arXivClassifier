1501.03497,astro-ph,"Extracting Times of Arrival from pulsar radio signals depends on the knowledge of the pulsars pulse profile and how this template is generated. We examine pulsar template generation with Bayesian methods. We will contrast the classical generation mechanism of averaging intensity profiles with a new approach based on Bayesian inference. We introduce the Bayesian measurement model imposed and derive the algorithm to reconstruct a ""statistical template"" out of noisy data. The properties of these ""statistical templates"" are analysed with simulated and real measurement data from PSR B113316. We explain how to put this new form of template to use in analysing secondary parameters of interest and give various examples: We implement a nonlinear filter for determining ToAs of pulsars. Applying this method to data from PSR J17130747 we derive ToAs self consistently, meaning all epochs were timed and we used the same epochs for template generation. While the average template contains fluctuations and noise as unavoidable artifacts, we find that the ""statistical template"" derived by Bayesian inference quantifies fluctuations and remaining uncertainty. This is why the algorithm suggested turns out to reconstruct templates of statistical significance from ten to fifty single pulses. A moving data window of fifty pulses, taking out one single pulse at the beginning and adding one at the end of the window unravels the characteristics of the methods to be compared. It shows that the change induced in the classical reconstruction is dominated by random fluctuations for the average template, while statistically significant changes drive the dynamics of the proposed method's reconstruction. The analysis of phase shifts with simulated data reveals that the proposed nonlinear algorithm is able to reconstruct correct phase information along with an acceptable estimation of the remaining uncertainty.",15,[],1
1508.03465,astro-ph,"As of 2023, the Square Kilometre Array will constitute the world's largest radio telescope, offering unprecedented capabilities for a diverse science programme in radio astronomy. At the same time, the SKA will be ideally suited to detect extensive air showers initiated by cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere via their radio emission. With its very dense and uniform antenna spacing in a fiducial area of one kmequation and its large bandwidth of 50-350 MHz, the low-frequency part of the SKA will provide very precise measurements of individual cosmic ray air showers. These precision measurements will allow detailed studies of the mass composition of cosmic rays in the energy region of transition from a Galactic to an extragalactic origin. Also, the SKA will facilitate three-dimensional ""tomography"" of the electromagnetic cascades of air showers, allowing the study of particle interactions at energies beyond the reach of the LHC. Finally, studies of possible connections between air showers and lightning initiation can be taken to a new level with the SKA. We discuss the science potential of air shower detection with the SKA and report on the technical requirements and project status.",15,"['hep-ex', 'physics']",1
1503.01146,astro-ph,"In the Spring of 2011 we carried out a 2.5 month reverberation mapping campaign using the 3 m Shane telescope at Lick Observatory, monitoring 15 low-redshift Seyfert 1 galaxies. This paper describes the observations, reductions and measurements, and data products from the spectroscopic campaign. The reduced spectra were fitted with a multicomponent model in order to isolate the contributions of various continuum and emission-line components. We present light curves of broad emission lines and the AGN continuum, and measurements of the broad H-beta line widths in mean and root-mean square (rms) spectra. For the most highly variable AGNs we also measured broad H-beta line widths and velocity centroids from the nightly spectra. In four AGNs exhibiting the highest variability amplitudes, we detect anticorrelations between broad H-beta width and luminosity, demonstrating that the broad-line region ""breathes"" on short timescales of days to weeks in response to continuum variations. We also find that broad H-beta velocity centroids can undergo substantial changes in response to continuum variations; in NGC 4593 the broad H-beta velocity shifted by ~250 km/s over a one-month duration. This reverberation-induced velocity shift effect is likely to contribute a significant source of confusion noise to binary black hole searches that use multi-epoch quasar spectroscopy to detect binary orbital motion. We also present results from simulations that examine biases that can occur in measurement of broad-line widths from rms spectra due to the contributions of continuum variations and photon-counting noise.",15,[],1
1510.05671,astro-ph,"We investigate the formation of metal-poor globular clusters (GCs) at the center of two dark matter halos with equation at equation using cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. We find that very compact (equation 1 pc) and massive (equation) clusters form rapidly when pristine gas collapses isothermally with the aid of efficient Lyequation emission during the transition from molecular-cooling halos to atomic-cooling halos. Because the local free-fall time of dense star-forming gas is very short (equation), a large fraction of the collapsed gas is turned into stars before stellar feedback processes blow out the gas and shut down star formation. Although the early stage of star formation is limited to a small region of the central star-forming disk, we find that the disk quickly fragments due to metal enrichment from supernovae. Sub-clusters formed in the fragmented clouds eventually merge with the main cluster at the center. The simulated clusters closely resemble the local GCs in mass and size but show a metallicity spread that is much wider than found in the local GCs. We discuss a role of pre-enrichment by Pop III and II stars as a potential solution to the latter issue. Although not without shortcomings, it is encouraging that a naive blind (not tuned) cosmological simulation presents a possible channel for the formation of at least some massive GCs.",15,[],1
1508.03916,astro-ph,"For equation Scuti star CoRoT 102749568, 52 independent frequencies were obtained by Paparequation et al. 2013. We find that there are 4 multiplets and 8 doublets with nearly equal split caused by rotation. Differential rotation is suggested instead of rigid body rotation to explain the equal split phenomenon. Grids of models are computed with MESA to fit observational frequencies of CoRoT 102749568. After rejecting modes of equation in multiplets and doublets, we identify 31 modes of equation and 3 modes of equation, including 4 modes of equation, 9 modes of equation, 11 modes of equation, and 10 modes of equation.

1503.03411,astro-ph,"The presence of a helical magnetic field threading the jet of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) should give rise to a gradient in the observed Faraday rotation measure (RM) across the jet, due to the associated systematic change in the line-of-sight magnetic field. Reports of observations of transverse RM gradients across AGN jets have appeared in the literature starting from 2002, but concerns were raised about the resolution required for these gradients to be reliable, and there was a lack of a full understanding of the best approach to accurate estimation of the uncertainties of local RM values. These questions have now been resolved by recent Monte Carlo simulations carried out by various groups, enabling both a verification of previously published results and reliable analyses of new data. We consider here RM gradients across the jet structures of 15 AGN, some previously published in the refereed literature but without a correct and complete error analysis, and some published for the first time here, all of which have monotonic transverse RM gradients with significances of at least 3 sigma.",15,[],1
1504.03927,astro-ph,"Transitional disks with large dust cavities are important laboratories to study planet formation and disk evolution. Cold gas may still be present inside these cavities, but the quantification of this gas is challenging. The gas content is important to constrain the origin of the dust cavity. We use Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of 12CO 6--5 and 690 GHz (Band 9) continuum of five well-studied transitional disks. In addition, we analyze previously published Band 7 observations of a disk in 12CO 3--2 line and 345 GHz continuum. The observations are used to set constraints on the gas and dust surface density profiles, in particular the drop delta-gas of the gas density inside the dust cavity. The physical-chemical modeling code DALI is used to analyze the gas and dust images simultaneously. We model SR21, HD135344B, LkCa15, SR24S and RXJ1615-3255 (Band 9) and J1604-2130 (Band 7). The SED and continuum visibility curve constrain the dust surface density. Subsequently, the same model is used to calculate the 12CO emission, which is compared with the observations through spectra and intensity cuts. The amount of gas inside the cavity is quantified by varying the delta-gas parameter. Model fits to the dust and gas indicate that gas is still present inside the dust cavity for all disks but at a reduced level. The gas surface density drops inside the cavity by at least a factor 10, whereas the dust density drops by at least a factor 1000. Disk masses are comparable with previous estimates from the literature, cavity radii are found to be smaller than in the 345 GHz SubMillimeter Array (SMA) data. The derived gas surface density profiles suggest clearing of the cavity by one or more companions in all cases, trapping the millimeter-sized dust at the edge of the cavity.",15,[],1
1502.00032,astro-ph,"Stellar winds observed in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are usually attributed to a combination of stellar pulsations and radiation pressure on dust. Shock waves triggered by pulsations propagate through the atmosphere, compressing the gas and lifting it to cooler regions, which create favourable conditions for grain growth. If sufficient radiative acceleration is exerted on the newly formed grains through absorption or scattering of stellar photons, an outflow can be triggered. Strong candidates for wind-driving dust species in M-type AGB stars are magnesium silicates (MgequationSiOequation and MgSiOequation). Such grains can form close to the stellar surface, they consist of abundant materials and, if they grow to sizes comparable to the wavelength of the stellar flux maximum, they experience strong acceleration by photon scattering.   We use a frequency-dependent radiation-hydrodynamics code with a detailed description for the growth of MgequationSiOequation grains to calculate the first extensive set of time-dependent wind models for M-type AGB stars. The resulting wind properties, visual and near-IR photometry and mid-IR spectra are compared with observations.We show that the models can produce outflows for a wide range of stellar parameters. We also demonstrate that they reproduce observed mass-loss rates and wind velocities, as well as visual and near-IR photometry. However, the current models do not show the characteristic silicate features at 10 and 18 equationm as a result of the cool temperature of MgequationSiOequation grains in the wind. Including a small amount of Fe in the grains further out in the circumstellar envelope will increase the grain temperature and result in pronounced silicate features, without significantly affecting the photometry in the visual and near-IR wavelength regions.",15,[],1
1501.07217,astro-ph,"The internal rotation of post-main sequence stars is investigated, in response to the convective pumping of angular momentum toward the stellar core, combined with a tight magnetic coupling between core and envelope. The spin evolution is calculated using model stars of initial mass 1, 1.5 and equation, taking into account mass loss on the giant branches. We also include the deposition of orbital angular momentum from a sub-stellar companion, as influenced by tidal drag along with the excitation of orbital eccentricity by a fluctuating gravitational quadrupole moment. A range of angular velocity profiles equation is considered in the envelope, extending from solid rotation to constant specific angular momentum. We focus on the back reaction of the Coriolis force, and the threshold for dynamo action in the inner envelope. Quantitative agreement with measurements of core rotation in subgiants and post-He core flash stars by Kepler is obtained with a two-layer angular velocity profile: uniform specific angular momentum where the Coriolis parameter equation (here equation is the convective time); and equation where equation. The inner profile is interpreted in terms of a balance between the Coriolis force and angular pressure gradients driven by radially extended convective plumes. Inward angular momentum pumping reduces the surface rotation of subgiants, and the need for a rejuvenated magnetic wind torque. The co-evolution of internal magnetic fields and rotation is considered in Kissin & Thompson, along with the breaking of the rotational coupling between core and envelope due to heavy mass loss.",15,[],1
1509.07521,astro-ph,"We consider a model in which a pseudo-scalar field equation rolls for some e-folds during inflation, sourcing one helicity of a gauge field. These fields are only gravitationally coupled to the inflaton, and therefore produce scalar and tensor primordial perturbations only through gravitational interactions. These sourced signals are localized on modes that exit the horizon while the roll of equation is significant. We focus our study on cases in which the model can simultaneously produce (i) a large gravitational wave signal, resulting in observable B-modes of the CMB polarizations, and (ii) sufficiently small scalar perturbations, so to be in agreement with the current limits from temperature anisotropies. Different choice of parameters can instead lead to a localized and visible departure from gaussianity in the scalar sector, either at CMB or LSS scales.",15,"['gr-qc', 'hep-ph', 'hep-th']",1
1510.01340,astro-ph,"Increasing the statistics of spectroscopically confirmed evolved massive stars in the Local Group enables the investigation of the mass loss phenomena that occur in these stars in the late stages of their evolution. We aim to complete the census of luminous mid-IR sources in star-forming dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies of the Local Group. To achieve this we employed mid-IR photometric selection criteria to identify evolved massive stars, such as red supergiants (RSGs) and luminous blue variables (LBVs), by using the fact that these types of stars have infrared excess due to dust. The method is based on 3.6 equationm and 4.5 equationm photometry from archival equation Space Telescope images of nearby galaxies. We applied our criteria to 4 dIrr galaxies: Pegasus, Phoenix, Sextans A, and WLM, selecting 79 point sources, which we observed with the VLT/FORS2 spectrograph in multi-object spectroscopy mode. We identified 13 RSGs, of which 6 are new discoveries, also 2 new emission line stars, and 1 candidate yellow supergiant. Among the other observed objects we identified carbon stars, foreground giants, and background objects, such as a quasar and an early-type galaxy that contaminate our survey. We use the results of our spectroscopic survey to revise the mid-IR and optical selection criteria for identifying RSGs from photometric measurements. The optical selection criteria are more efficient in separating extragalactic RSGs from foreground giants than mid-IR selection criteria, however the mid-IR selection criteria are useful for identifying dusty stars in the Local Group. This work serves as a basis for further investigation of the newly discovered dusty massive stars and their host galaxies.",15,[],1
1503.07041,astro-ph,The model is presented of HequationO maser in the equation line within the first excited vibrational state of the molecule around oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch stars. It is suggested that the maser cloud is located in the inner layers of the circumstellar envelope where intense dust formation takes place. The calculations took into account rotational levels belonging to the five lowest vibrational states of the HequationO molecule. The model predicts the gain values of the 658-GHz maser about equation cmequation at Hequation molecule concentrations equation cmequation and at high ortho-HequationO concentrations equation cmequation. The gas temperatures equation K are considered to be a necessary condition for the effective maser operation. Results are presented for other maser transitions of the excited vibrational states of the molecule.,15,[],1
1503.03097,astro-ph,"The debris disk closest to Earth is the one around the star epsilon Eridani at a distance of 3.2 pc. It is the prime target for detailed studies of a belt of planetesimals left from the early phase of planet formation other than the Kuiper Belt. The non-uniform ring-like structure around epsilon Eridani, originally discovered at lambda=850 microns with the bolometer camera SCUBA, could be the signpost of unseen long-period planets interior to the disk that gravitationally interact with it through mean-motion resonances. However, the reliability of the structure at 850 microns, which has been debated, has not been verified with independent observations until now. We present a high signal-to-noise ratio image of this structure at lambda=1.2 mm made with the bolometer camera MAMBO and compare this with the SCUBA image. We have found that three of the four emission clumps (NE, NW, SW) and the two deep hollows to the east and west are at the same positions in the MAMBO and SCUBA images within astrometric uncertainty. The SE clump is at odds, significantly brighter and more extended in the SCUBA than in the MAMBO images, but it is possible that this mismatch is an artifact. We conclude that this degree of positional coincidence provides tentative evidence that the observed structure is robust. In addition, we present the radial brightness profile of our MAMBO image and show that the width of the planetesimal belt around epsilon Eridani is narrower than 22 AU, a more stringent upper limit than determined from previous observations. The corresponding relative width is equation, which is lower than for the Kuiper Belt.",15,[],1
1507.08774,astro-ph,"We present the first search for spinning dust emission from a sample of 34 Galactic cold cores, performed using the CARMA interferometer. For each of our cores we use photometric data from the Herschel Space Observatory to constrain NH, Td, nH, and G0. By computing the mass of the cores and comparing it to the Bonnor-Ebert mass, we determined that 29 of the 34 cores are gravitationally unstable and undergoing collapse. In fact, we found that 6 cores are associated with at least one young stellar object, suggestive of their proto-stellar nature. By investigating the physical conditions within each core, we can shed light on the cm emission revealed (or not) by our CARMA observations. Indeed, we find that only 3 of our cores have any significant detectable cm emission. Using a spinning dust model, we predict the expected level of spinning dust emission in each core and find that for all 34 cores, the predicted level of emission is larger than the observed cm emission constrained by the CARMA observations. Moreover, even in the cores for which we do detect cm emission, we cannot, at this stage, discriminate between free-free emission from young stellar objects and spinning dust emission. We emphasise that, although the CARMA observations described in this analysis place important constraints on the presence of spinning dust in cold, dense environments, the source sample targeted by these observations is not statistically representative of the entire population of Galactic cores.",15,[],1
1509.03841,astro-ph,"The formation mechanisms of thick discs are under discussion. Thick discs might have formed either at high redshift on a short time-scale or might have been built slowly over time. They may have an internal or an external origin. Here we study in detail the kinematics and the stellar populations of the thick disc of ESO533-4. ESO533-4 is a nearby bulgeless galaxy.   We present the first ever IFU study of an edge-on galaxy with enough depth to study the thick disc. We exposed ESO533-4 with VIMOS@VLT for 6.5hours. The FOV covered an axial extent 0.1-0.7r25 (1-7kpc). We used pPXF and the MILES library to obtain velocity and stellar population maps. We compared our kinematic data with simple GADGET-2 models.   The apparent rotational lag of the thick disc of ESO533-4 is compatible with that expected from the combinations of two effects: differential asymmetric drift and the projection effects arising from studying a disc a few degrees (2-3) away from edge-on. Thus, ESO533-4 contains little or no retrograde material. This is compatible with three formation scenarii: the secular heating of an initially thin disc, the formation of the thick disc at high redshift in a turbulent disc phase, and its creation in a major merger event. If happening in all galaxies, this last mechanism would cause retrograde thick discs in half of them. Retrograde discs have not been observed in the five massive disc galaxies (vc>120km s-1) for which thick disc kinematics are known. The populations of the thin and the thick discs are separated in the Age-log(Z/ZSun) plane. Thus, the thin and thick discs are made of two distinct stellar populations. Although the stellar population results are not conclusive due to the high dust extinction in ESO533-4, they do not favour a secular evolution origin for the thick disc. Hence, we suggest that the thick disc of ESO533-4 formed in a relatively short event (Abridged).",15,[],1
1510.02285,astro-ph,"Motivated by the observations of several infrared-excess bow-shock sources and proplyd-like objects near the Galactic centre, we analyse the effect of a potential outflow from the centre on bow shock properties. We show that due to the non-negligible isotropic central outflow the bow-shock evolution along the orbit becomes asymmetric between the pre-peribothron and post-peribothron phases. This is demonstrated by the calculation of the bow-shock size evolution, the velocity along the shocked layer, the surface density of the bow-shock, and by emission-measure maps close to the peribothron passage. Within the ambient velocity range of equation the asymmetry is profound and the changes are considerable for different outflow velocities. As a case study we perform model calculations for the Dusty S-cluster Object (DSO/G2) as a potential young stellar object that is currently being monitored and has passed the pericentre at equation Schwarzschild radii from the supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) in 2014. We show that the velocity field of the shocked layer can contribute to the observed increasing line width of the DSO source up to the peribothron. Subsequently, supposing that the line emission originates in the bow shock, a decrease of the line width is expected. Furthermore, the decline of the bow-shock emission measure in the post-peribothron phase could help to reveal the emission of the putative star. The dominant contribution of circumstellar matter (either inflow or outflow) is consistent with the observed stable luminosity and compactness of the DSO/G2 source during its pericentre passage.",15,[],1
1508.06059,astro-ph,"Blazars are active galactic nuclei, and the most numerous High Energy (HE) and Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray emitters. Their optical emission is often dominated by non-thermal, and, in the case of BL Lacs, featureless continuum radiation. This renders the determination of their redshift extremely difficult. Indeed, as of today only about 50 % of gamma-ray blazars have a measured spectroscopic redshift. The knowledge of redshift is fundamental because it allows the precise modeling of the VHE emission and also of its interaction with the extragalactic background light (EBL). The beginning of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) operations in the near future will allow the detection of several hundreds of new BL Lacs. Using the first Fermi catalogue of sources above 10 GeV (1FHL), we performed simulations which demonstrate that at least half of the 1FHL BL Lacs detectable by CTA will not have a measured redshift. Indeed the organization of observing campaigns to measure the redshift of these blazars has been recognized as a necessary support for the AGN Key Science Project of CTA. Taking advantage of the recent success of an X-shooter GTO observing campaign, we thus devised an observing campaign to measure the redshifts of as many as possible of these candidates. The main characteristic of this campaign with respect to previous ones will be the use of higher resolution spectrographs and of 8 meter class telescopes. We are starting submitting proposals for these observations. In this paper we will briefly describe the selection of the candidates, the characteristics of these observation and the expected results.",15,[],1
1502.04009,astro-ph,"We present the results of an ensemble of SPH simulations that follow the evolution of prestellar cores for equation. All the cores have the same mass, and start with the same radius, density profile, thermal and turbulent energy. Our purpose is to explore the consequences of varying the fraction of turbulent energy, equation, that is solenoidal, as opposed to compressive; specifically we consider equation. For each value of equation, we follow ten different realisations of the turbulent velocity field, in order also to have a measure of the stochastic variance blurring any systematic trends. With low equation filament fragmentation dominates and delivers relatively high mass stars. Conversely, with high values of equation disc fragmentation dominates and delivers relatively low mass stars. There are no discernible systematic trends in the multiplicity statistics obtained with different equation.",15,[],1
1510.06811,astro-ph,"Redback millisecond pulsars (hereafter redbacks) are a sub-population of eclipsing millisecond pulsars in close binaries. The formation processes of these systems are not clear. The three pulsars showing transitions between rotation- and accretion-powered states belong to both redbacks and transient low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), suggesting a possible evolutionary link between the them. Through binary evolution calculations, we show that the accretion disks in almost all LMXBs are subject to the thermal-viscous instability during certain evolutionary stages, and the parameter space for the disk instability covers the distribution of known redbacks in the orbital period - companion mass plane. We accordingly suggest that the abrupt reduction of the mass accretion rate during quiescence of transient LMXBs provides a plausible way to switch on the pulsar activity, leading to the formation of redbacks, if the neutron star has been spun up to be an energetic millisecond pulsar. We investigate the evolution of redbacks, taking into account the evaporation feedback, and discuss its possible influence on the formation of black widow millisecond pulsars.",15,[],1

1510.04900,astro-ph,"This paper combines observational datasets and cosmological simulations to generate realistic numerical replicas of the nearby Universe. These latter are excellent laboratories for studies of the non-linear process of structure formation in our neighborhood. With measurements of radial peculiar velocities in the Local Universe (cosmicflows-2) and a newly developed technique, we produce Constrained Local UniversE Simulations (CLUES). To assess the quality of these constrained simulations, we compare them with random simulations as well as with local observations. The cosmic variance, defined as the mean one-sigma scatter of cell-to-cell comparison between two fields, is significantly smaller for the constrained simulations than for the random simulations. Within the inner part of the box where most of the constraints are, the scatter is smaller by a factor 2 to 3 on a 5 Mpc/h scale with respect to that found for random simulations. This one-sigma scatter obtained when comparing the simulated and the observation-reconstructed velocity fields is only 104 /- 4 km/s i.e. the linear theory threshold. These two results demonstrate that these simulations are in agreement with each other and with the observations of our neighborhood. For the first time, simulations constrained with observational radial peculiar velocities resemble the Local Universe up to a distance of 150 Mpc/h on a scale of a few tens of megaparsecs. When focusing on the inner part of the box, the resemblance with our cosmic neighborhood extends to a few megaparsecs (< 5 Mpc/h).

1504.04372,astro-ph,"Motivated by the recent discovery of several dwarfs near the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), we study the accretion of massive satellites onto Milky Way (MW)/M31-like halos using the ELVIS suite of N-body simulations. We identify 25 surviving LMC-mass subhalos, and investigate the lower-mass satellites that were associated with these subhalos before they fell into the MW/M31 halos. Typically, 7% of the overall z=0 satellite population of MW/M31 halos were in a surviving LMC-group before falling into the MW/M31 halo. This fraction can vary between 1% and 25%, being higher for groups with higher mass and/or more recent infall times. Groups of satellites disperse rapidly in phase space after infall, and their distances and velocities relative to the group center become statistically similar to the overall satellite population after 4-8 Gyr. We quantify the likelihood that satellites were associated with an LMC-mass group as a function of both distance and velocity relative to the LMC at z=0. The close proximity in distance of the nine Dark Energy Survey candidate dwarf galaxies to the LMC suggest that ~2-4 are likely associated with the LMC. Furthermore, if several of these dwarfs are genuine members, then the LMC-group probably fell into the MW very recently, <2 Gyr ago. If the connection with the LMC is established with follow-up velocity measurements, these ""satellites of satellites"" represent prime candidates to study the affects of group pre-processing on lower mass dwarfs.",15,[],1
1502.07210,astro-ph,We describe the development of the model for interstellar gamma-ray emission that is the standard adopted by the LAT team and is publicly available. The model is based on a linear combination of templates for interstellar gas column density and for the inverse Compton emission. The spectral energy distributions of the gamma-ray emission associated with each template are determined from a fit to 4 years of Fermi-LAT data in 14 independent energy bins from 50 MeV to 50 GeV. We fit those distributions with a realistic model for the emission processes to extrapolate to higher energies. We also include large-scale structures like Loop I and the Fermi bubbles following an iterative procedure that re-injects filtered LAT counts residual maps into the model. We confirm that the cosmic-ray proton density varies with the distance from the Galactic center and find a continuous softening of the proton spectrum with this distance. We observe that the Fermi bubbles have a shape similar to a catenary at their bases.,15,[],1
1501.00390,astro-ph,"Stacking polarized radio emission in SKA surveys provides statistical information on large samples that is not accessible otherwise due to limitations in sensitivity, source statistics in small fields, and averaging over frequency (including Faraday synthesis). Polarization is a special case because one obvious source of stacking targets is the Stokes I source catalog, possibly in combination with external catalogs, for example an SKA HI survey or a non-radio survey. We point out the significance of stacking sub-samples selected by additional observable parameters to investigate relations that reveal more about the physics of the source. Applications of stacking polarization include, but are not limited to, obtaining in a statistical sense polarization information to the detection limit in total intensity, depolarization as a function of cosmic time at consistent source-frame wavelengths, magnetic field properties in objects with a low radio luminosity such as dwarf and low-surface-brightness galaxies, and investigating potential correlations of observable parameters with the average magnetic field direction in a sample. We also point out the potential use of stacking in validating the polarization calibration of a survey. While stacking is flexible in terms of survey definition, we discuss optimal survey parameters for the science experiments presented, as well as computing and archiving requirements.",15,[],1

The multi-wavelength properties of the source present a natural analogy with accretion state changes of stellar mass black holes, suggesting all TDFs could be accompanied by a jet.

1503.05935,astro-ph,"The collimation and evolution of relativistic outflows in equation-ray bursts (GRBs) are determined by their interaction with the stellar envelope through which they travel before reaching the much larger distance where the energy is dissipated and equation-rays are produced. We consider the case of a Poynting flux dominated relativistic outflow and show that it suffers strong inverse-Compton (IC) scattering drag near the stellar surface and the jet is slowed down to sub-relativistic speed if its initial magnetization parameter (equation) is larger than about 10equation. If the temperature of the cocoon surrounding the jet were to be larger than about 10 keV, then an optically thick layer of electrons and positrons forms at the interface of the cocoon and the jet, and one might expect this pair screen to protect the interior of the jet from IC drag. However, the pair screen turns out to be ephemeral, and instead of shielding the jet it speeds up the IC drag on it.

1510.06751,astro-ph,"Since the Fermi discovery of equation-rays from novae, one of the biggest questions in the field has been how novae generate such high-energy emission. Shocks must be a fundamental ingredient. Six months of radio observations of the 2012 nova V5589 Sgr with the VLA and 15 weeks of X-ray observations with Swift/XRT show that the radio emission consisted of: 1) a shock-powered, non-thermal flare; and 2) weak thermal emission from equation Mequation of freely expanding, photoionized ejecta. Absorption features in the optical spectrum and the peak optical brightness suggest that V5589 Sgr lies 4 kpc away (3.2-4.6 kpc). The shock-powered flare dominated the radio light curve at low frequencies before day 100. The spectral evolution of the radio flare, its high radio brightness temperature, the presence of unusually hard (equation keV) X-rays, and the ratio of radio to X-ray flux near radio maximum all support the conclusions that the flare was shock-powered and non-thermal. Unlike most other novae with strong shock-powered radio emission, V5589 Sgr is not embedded in the wind of a red-giant companion. Based on the similar inclinations and optical line profiles of V5589 Sgr and V959 Mon, we propose that shocks in V5589 Sgr formed from collisions between a slow flow with an equatorial density enhancement and a subsequent faster flow. We speculate that the relatively high speed and low mass of the ejecta led to the unusual radio emission from V5589 Sgr, and perhaps also to the non-detection of equation-rays.",15,[],1
1505.03954,astro-ph,"A promising formation channel of SMBHs at redshift 6 is the so-called DC model, which posits that a massive seed BH forms through gravitational collapse of a equation SMS. We study the evolution of such a SMS growing by rapid mass accretion. In particular, we examine the impact of time-dependent mass accretion of repeating burst and quiescent phases that are expected to occur with a self-gravitating circumstellar disk. We show that the stellar evolution with such episodic accretion differs qualitatively from that expected with a constant accretion rate, even if the mean accretion rate is the same. Unlike the case of constant mass accretion, whereby the star expands roughly following equation, the protostar can substantially contract during the quiescent phases between accretion bursts. The stellar effective temperature and ionizing photon emissivity increase accordingly as the star contracts, which can cause strong ionizing feedback and halt the mass accretion onto the star. With a fixed duration of the quiescent phase equation, such contraction occurs in early evolutionary phases, i.e. for equation with equation yr. For later epochs and larger masses but the same equation, contraction is negligible even during quiescent phases. With larger quiescent times equation, however, the star continues to contract during quiescent phases even for the higher stellar masses. We show that such behavior is well understood by comparing the interval time and the thermal relaxation time for a bloated surface layer. We conclude that the UV radiative feedback becomes effective if the quiescent phase associated by the burst accretion is longer than equation yr, which is possible in an accretion disk forming in the direct collapse model.",15,[],1

1510.05673,astro-ph,"From a comprehensive statistical analysis of equation X-ray light-curves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) collected from December 2004 to the end of 2010, we found a three-parameter correlation between the isotropic energy emitted in the rest frame 1-10equation keV energy band during the prompt emission (Eequation), the rest frame peak of the prompt emission energy spectrum (Eequation), and the X-ray energy emitted in the rest frame 0.3-30 keV observed energy band (Eequation), computed excluding the contribution of the flares. In this paper, we update this correlation with the data collected until June 2014, expanding the sample size with equation35% more objects, where the number of short GRBs doubled. With this larger sample we confirm the existence of a universal correlation that connects the prompt and afterglow properties of long and short GRBs. We show that this correlation does not depend on the X-ray light-curve morphology and that further analysis is necessary to firmly exclude possible biases derived by redshift measurements. In addition we discuss about the behavior of the peculiar objects as ultra-long GRBs and we propose the existence of an intermediate group between long and short GRBs. Interestingly, two GRBs with uncertain classification fall into this category. Finally, we discuss the physics underlying this correlation, in the contest of the efficiency of conversion of the prompt equation-ray emission energy into the kinetic energy of the afterglow, the photosferic model, and the cannonball model.",15,[],1

We select a sample of 52 000 LOWZ and CMASS LRGs from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) SDSS-DR10 in the ~450 deg2 that overlaps with imaging data from the second Red-sequence Cluster Survey (RCS2), group them into bins of absolute magnitude and redshift and measure their weak lensing signals. The source redshift distribution has a median of 0.7, which allows us to study the lensing signal as a function of lens redshift. We interpret the lensing signal using a halo model, from which we obtain the halo masses as well as the normalisations of the mass-concentration relations. We find that the concentration of haloes that host LRGs is consistent with dark matter only simulations once we allow for miscentering or satellites in the modelling. The slope of the luminosity-to-halo mass relation has a typical value of 1.4 and does not change with redshift, but we do find evidence for a change in amplitude: the average halo mass of LOWZ galaxies increases by 25-1416 % between z=0.36 and 0.22 to an average value of 6.43/-0.52 x 1013 h70-1 Msun.

We report the first observations by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) mission of a spectacular fast CME/prominence eruption associated with an equivalent X1.6 flare on 2014 May 9. The maximum plane-of-sky and Doppler velocities of the eruption are 1200 and 460 km/s, respectively. There are two eruption components separated by ~200 km/s in Doppler velocity: a primary, bright component and a secondary, faint component, suggesting a hollow, rather than solid, cone-shaped distribution of material. The eruption involves a left-handed helical structure undergoing counter-clockwise (viewed top-down) unwinding motion. There is a temporal evolution from upward eruption to downward fallback with less-than-free-fall speeds and decreasing nonthermal line widths. We find a wide range of Mg II k/h line intensity ratios (less than ~2 expected for optically-thin thermal emission): the lowest ever-reported median value of 1.17 found in the fallback material and a comparably high value of 1.63 in nearby coronal rain and intermediate values of 1.53 and 1.41 in the two eruption components. The fallback material exhibits a strong (equation) linear correlation between the k/h ratio and the Doppler velocity as well as the line intensity.

1512.01159,astro-ph,"We model the vertical structure of magnetized accretion disks subject to viscous and resistive heating, and irradiation by the central star. We apply our formalism to the radial structure of magnetized accretion disks threaded by a poloidal magnetic field dragged during the process of star formation developed by Shu and coworkers. We consider disks around low mass protostars, T Tauri, and FU Orionis stars. We consider two levels of disk magnetization, equation (strongly magnetized disks), and equation (weakly magnetized disks). The rotation rates of strongly magnetized disks have large deviations from Keplerian rotation. In these models, resistive heating dominates the thermal structure for the FU Ori disk. The T Tauri disk is very thin and cold because it is strongly compressed by magnetic pressure; it may be too thin compared with observations. Instead, in the weakly magnetized disks, rotation velocities are close to Keplerian, and resistive heating is always less than 7\% of the viscous heating. In these models, the T Tauri disk has a larger aspect ratio, consistent with that inferred from observations. All the disks have spatially extended hot atmospheres where the irradiation flux is absorbed, although most of the mass (equation \%) is in the disk midplane. With the advent of ALMA one expects direct measurements of magnetic fields and their morphology at disk scales. It will then be possible to determine the mass-to-flux ratio of magnetized accretion disks around young stars, an essential parameter for their structure and evolution. Our models contribute to the understanding of the vertical structure and emission of these disks.",15,[],1

The intent of this work is to examine the entire sample of over 30,000 objects for periodic, aperiodic, and sporadic behaviors in their light curves. We show a modified version of the fast equation periodogram algorithm (Fequation) and change-point analysis (CPA) as tools for detecting and assessing the significance of periodic and non-periodic variations.

An empirical relationship between the level of chromospheric emission measured by log (R'HK) and the spectroscopic rotation periods is reported. This relation is largely independent of the spectral type and the metallicity of the stars and can be used to make a reliable prediction of rotation periods for late K to mid-M dwarfs with low levels of activity.

1504.07835,astro-ph,"Numerical MHD simulations play increasingly important role for understanding mechanisms of stellar magnetism. We present simulations of convection and dynamos in density-stratified rotating spherical fluid shells. We employ a new 3D simulation code for the solution of a physically consistent anelastic model of the process with a minimum number of parameters. The reported dynamo simulations extend into a ""buoyancy-dominated"" regime where the buoyancy forcing is dominant while the Coriolis force is no longer balanced by pressure gradients and strong anti-solar differential rotation develops as a result. We find that the self-generated magnetic fields, despite being relatively weak, are able to reverse the direction of differential rotation from anti-solar to solar-like. We also find that convection flows in this regime are significantly stronger in the polar regions than in the equatorial region, leading to non-oscillatory dipole-dominated dynamo solutions, and to concentration of magnetic field in the polar regions. We observe that convection has different morphology in the inner and at the outer part of the convection zone simultaneously such that organized geostrophic convection columns are hidden below a near-surface layer of well-mixed highly-chaotic convection. While we focus the attention on the buoyancy-dominated regime, we also demonstrate that conical differential rotation profiles and persistent regular dynamo oscillations can be obtained in the parameter space of the rotation-dominated regime even within this minimal model.",15,['physics'],1

We model the observed x-rays as emission from both heated circumstellar matter and supernova ejecta. The circumstellar density profile probed by the supernova shock reveals a history of steady mass loss during the final 400 years. The inferred mass loss rate of equation points back to a 14 equation progenitor. Soon after the explosion we find significant absorption of reverse shock emission by a cooling shell. The column depth of this shell observed in absorption provides an independent and consistent measurement of the circumstellar density seen in emission. We also determine the efficiency of cosmic ray acceleration from x-rays produced by Inverse Compton scattering of optical photons by relativistic electrons.

They follow trajectories in a slot gap using 3D force-free magnetic field geometry, gaining pitch angles through resonant cyclotron absorption of radio photons, radiating and scattering synchrotron emission at high altitudes out to and beyond the light cylinder. Full angular dependence of the synchrotron photon density is simulated in the scattering and all processes are treated in the inertial observer frame. Spectra for the Crab and Vela pulsars as well as two energetic millisecond pulsars, B1821-24 and B193721 are simulated using this model. The simulation of the Crab pulsar radiation can reproduce both the flux level and the shape of the observed optical to hard X-ray emission assuming a pair multiplicity of equation, as well as the very-high-energy emission above 50 GeV detected by MAGIC and VERITAS, with both the synchrotron and SSC components reflecting the shape of the pair spectrum.

We compare Wide Field Camera 3 equation (rest-frame equation-band) imaging of 19 point source-subtracted quasar hosts to a matched sample of 84 inactive galaxies, testing whether the quasar hosts have greater evidence for strong gravitational interactions. Using an expert ranking procedure, we find that the quasar hosts are uniformly distributed within the merger sequence of inactive galaxies, with no preference for quasars in high-distortion hosts. Using a merger/non-merger cutoff approach, we recover distortion fractions of equation for quasar hosts and equation for inactive galaxies (distribution modes, 68% confidence intervals), with both measurements subjected to the same observational conditions and limitations. The slight enhancement in distorted fraction for quasar hosts over inactive galaxies is not significant, with a probability that the quasar fraction is higher of equation (equation), in line with results for lower mass and lower equation AGN.

We show that the shape and amplitude of the signals, manifesting primarily as horizontal accelerations, can be modeled approximately with a simple quasi-static point-load model of the negative pressure field associated with the vortices acting on the ground as an elastic half space. We suggest the load imposed by a dust devil of diameter D and core pressure letterPo is ~(letter/2)letterPoDequation, or for a typical terrestrial devil of 5 m diameter and 2 mbar, about the weight of a small car. The tilt depends on the inverse square of distance, and on the elastic properties of the ground, and the large signals we observe are in part due to the relatively soft playa sediment and the shallow installation of the instrument. Ground tilt may be a particularly sensitive means of detecting dust devils. The simple point-load model fails for large dust devils at short ranges, but more elaborate models incorporating the work of Sorrells (1971) may explain some of the more complex features in such cases, taking the vortex winds and ground velocity into account.

Our main conclusions are as follows: 1) In the first approximation the hypothesis is justified that the change in the sunspot and QBO cycles in the transition from the Sun to the heliosphere is due to 1) the different magnitude and time behavior of the large-scale and small-scale photospheric solar magnetic fields and 2) the stronger attenuation of the small-scale fields in this transition. 2) As the QBO in the HMF strength influences both the diffusion coefficients and drift velocity, it can give rise to the complex QBO in the GCR intensity with respect to the dominating HMF polarity. The description of drift velocity field for the periods of the HMF inversion is suggested, although it has drawbacks. 3) As the conditions in the heliosphere are quite different around the sunspot maximum and during the periods of low solar activity (both with respect to the HMF polarity distribution and with the presence or absence of the large-scale barriers), the suggestion that both the step-like changes of the GCR intensity and Gnevyshev Gap effect could have the same nature, looks questionable.",15,[],1

Hydrodynamics simulations in steady spiral models demonstrated that the dust lane locations relative to the stellar spiral arms (hereafter, arm-gas offsets) depend on radius, regardless of the strength and pitch angle of the spiral and the model of the inter-stellar medium (ISM).

Here we present a critical examination of the applicability of the thermal wind equation to calculate the wind induced gravity moments. Our analysis shows that wind induced gravity moments calculated from TWE are in overall agreement with the full solution to the Euler equation. However, the accuracy of individual high-degree moments calculated from TWE depends crucially on retaining the nonsphericity of the background density and gravity. Only when the background nonsphericity of the planet is taken into account, does the TWE make accurate enough prediction (with a few tens of percent errors) for individual high-degree gravity moments associated with deep zonal flows. Since the TWE is derived from the curl of the Euler equation and is a local relation, it necessarily says nothing about any density perturbations that contribute irrotational terms to the Euler equation and that have a non-local origin. However, the predicted corrections from these density contributions to the low harmonic degree gravity moments are not discernible from insignificant changes in interior models while the corrections at high harmonic degree are very small, a few percent or less.",15,[],1
1505.00268,astro-ph,"We calculate steady-state, one-dimensional hydrodynamic profiles of hot gas in slowly accreting (""quiescent"") galactic nuclei for a range of central black hole masses equation, parametrized gas heating rates, and observationally-motivated stellar density profiles. Mass is supplied to the circumnuclear medium by stellar winds, while energy is injected primarily by stellar winds, supernovae, and black hole feedback. Analytic estimates are derived for the stagnation radius (where the radial velocity of the gas passes through zero) and the large scale gas inflow rate, equation, as a function of equation and the gas heating efficiency, the latter being related to the star-formation history. We assess the conditions under which radiative instabilities develop in the hydrostatic region near the stagnation radius, both in the case of a single burst of star formation and for the average star formation history predicted by cosmological simulations. By combining a sample of measured nuclear X-ray luminosities, equation, of nearby quiescent galactic nuclei with our results for equation we address whether the nuclei are consistent with accreting in a steady-state, thermally-stable manner for radiative efficiencies predicted for radiatively inefficiency accretion flows. We find thermally-stable accretion cannot explain the short average growth times of low mass black holes in the local Universe, which must instead result from gas being fed in from large radii, due either to gas inflows or thermal instabilities acting on larger, galactic scales. Our results have implications for attempts to constrain the occupation fraction of SMBHs in low mass galaxies using the mean equation correlation, as well as the predicted diversity of the circumnuclear densities encountered by relativistic outflows from tidal disruption events.",15,[],1
1504.01878,astro-ph,"Our understanding of the formation and early evolution of globular clusters (GCs) has been totally overthrown with the discovery of the peculiar chemical properties of their long-lived host stars. As a consequence, the interpretation of the observed color-magnitude diagrams and of the properties of the GC stellar populations requires the use of stellar models computed with relevant chemical compositions. We present a grid of 224 stellar evolution for low-mass stars with initial masses between 0.3 and 1.0 Msun and initial helium mass fraction between 0.248 and 0.8 computed for [Fe/H]=-1.75 with the stellar evolution code STAREVOL. This grid is made available to the community. We explore the implications of the assumed initial chemical distribution for the main properties of the stellar models: evolution paths in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram (HRD), duration and characteristics of the main evolutionary phases, and the chemical nature of the white dwarf remnants. We also provide the ranges in initial stellar mass and helium content of the stars that populate the different regions of the HRD at the ages of 10 and 13.4 Gyr, which are typical for Galactic GCs.",15,[],1
1506.09033,astro-ph,"The averaged resonant equations of motion for the planar circular restricted three-body problem are solved on the linearization basis taking into account also non-gravitational effects. The averaged resonant equations are derived from Lagrange's planetary equations with additional Gauss's terms caused by the non-gravitational effects. The time depending solution has the standard form with exponential, quadratic, linear and constant terms. The existence of a rotational symmetry in the action of the non-gravitational effects around the star determines the order of a characteristic equation of the linearized system. In the symmetrical case (order 3) the considered non-gravitational effects are the stellar electromagnetic radiation and the radial stellar wind (stellar radiation). In the asymmetrical case (order 4) the stellar radiation and interstellar gas flow are considered. It is investigated how well the linearization solution describes real solution obtained from an equation of motion by a comparison of the resonant libration frequency found analytically and numerically. It is found that from initial values of the evolving orbital parameters (semimajor axis, eccentricity, longitude of pericenter, and resonant angular variable) in the averaged phase space the linearization frequency depends most sensitively on the initial value of the resonant angular variable. For small libration amplitudes of the resonant angular variable the best match of the real libration frequency and the linearization frequency is located approximately at the solution of the resonant condition (equation equation 0). If the initial averaged conditions are chosen close to the solution of resonant condition, then the linearization frequency for practically all simple oscillatory evolutions matches the real libration frequency and the linearization solution very well approximates the real evolution.",15,[],1
1512.06872,astro-ph,"Stacks of digital astronomical images are combined in order to increase image depth. The variable seeing conditions, sky background and transparency of ground-based observations make the coaddition process non-trivial. We present image coaddition methods optimized for source detection and flux measurement, that maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). We show that for these purposes the best way to combine images is to apply a matched filter to each image using its own point spread function (PSF) and only then to sum the images with the appropriate weights. Methods that either match filter after coaddition, or perform PSF homogenization prior to coaddition will result in loss of sensitivity. We argue that our method provides an increase of between a few and 25 percent in the survey speed of deep ground-based imaging surveys compared with weighted coaddition techniques. We demonstrate this claim using simulated data as well as data from the Palomar Transient Factory data release 2. We present a variant of this coaddition method which is optimal for PSF or aperture photometry. We also provide an analytic formula for calculating the S/N for PSF photometry on single or multiple observations. In the next paper in this series we present a method for image coaddition in the limit of background-dominated noise which is optimal for any statistical test or measurement on the constant-in-time image (e.g., source detection, shape or flux measurement or star-galaxy separation), making the original data redundant. We provide an implementation of this algorithm in MATLAB.",15,[],1
1501.03631,astro-ph,"Transits on single stars are rare. The probability rarely exceeds a few per cent. Furthermore, this probability rapidly approaches zero at increasing orbital period. Therefore transit surveys have been predominantly limited to the inner parts of exoplanetary systems. Here we demonstrate how circumbinary planets allow us to beat these unfavourable odds. By incorporating the geometry and the three-body dynamics of circumbinary systems, we analytically derive the probability of transitability, a configuration where the binary and planet orbits overlap on the sky. We later show that this is equivalent to the transit probability, but at an unspecified point in time. This probability, at its minimum, is always higher than for single star cases. In addition, it is an increasing function with mutual inclination. By applying our analytical development to eclipsing binaries, we deduce that transits are highly probable, and in some case guaranteed. For example, a circumbinary planet revolving at 1 AU around a 0.3 AU eclipsing binary is certain to eventually transit - a 100% probability - if its mutual inclination is greater than 0.6 deg. We show that the transit probability is generally only a weak function of the planet's orbital period; circumbinary planets may be used as practical tools for probing the outer regions of exoplanetary systems to search for and detect warm to cold transiting planets.",15,[],1
1511.06354,astro-ph,"Physical properties were derived for the candidate open cluster La Serena 94, recently unveiled by the VVV collaboration. Thanks to the exquisite angular resolution provided by GeMS/GSAOI, we could characterize this system in detail, for the first time, with deep photometry in JHKequation - bands. Decontaminated JHKequation diagrams reach about 5 mag below the cluster turnoff in H. The locus of red clump giants in the colour - colour diagram, together with an extinction law, was used to obtain an average extinction of equation. The same stars were considered as standard - candles to derive the cluster distance, equation kpc. Isochrones were matched to the cluster colour - magnitude diagrams to determine its age, equation, and metallicity, equation. A core radius of equation pc was found by fitting King models to the radial density profile. By adding up the visible stellar mass to an extrapolated mass function, the cluster mass was estimated as equation Mequation, consistent with an integrated magnitude of equation and a tidal radius of equation pc. The overall characteristics of La Serena 94 confirm that it is an old open cluster located in the Crux spiral arm towards the fourth Galactic quadrant and distant equation kpc from the Galactic centre. The cluster distorted structure, mass segregation and age indicate that it is a dynamically evolved stellar system.",15,[],1
1508.02721,astro-ph,"Relativistic jets naturally occur in astrophysical systems that involve accretion onto compact objects, such as core collapse of massive stars in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and accretion onto supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN). It is generally accepted that these jets are powered electromagnetically, by the magnetised rotation of a central compact object. However, how they produce the observed emission and survive the propagation for many orders of magnitude in distance without being disrupted by current-driven non-axisymmetric instabilities is the subject of active debate. We carry out time-dependent 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic, Poynting flux dominated jets. The jets are launched self-consistently by the rotation of a strongly magnetised central compact object. This determines the natural degree of azimuthal magnetic field winding, a crucial factor that controls jet stability. We find that the jets are susceptible to two types of instability: (i) a global, external kink mode that grows on long time scales and causes the jets to bodily bend sideways. Whereas this mode does not cause jet disruption over the simulated distances, it substantially reduces jet propagation speed. We show, via an analytic model, that the growth of the external kink mode depends on the slope of the ambient medium density profile. In flat density distributions characteristic of galactic cores, an AGN jet may stall, whereas in stellar envelopes the external kink weakens as the jet propagates outward; (ii) a local, internal kink mode that grows over short time scales and causes small-angle magnetic reconnection and conversion of about half of jet electromagnetic energy flux into heat. Based on the robustness and energetics of the internal kink mode, we suggest that this instability is the main dissipation mechanism responsible for powering GRB prompt emission.",15,[],1
1508.07003,astro-ph,"The massive red supergiant (RSG) W26 in Westerlund 1 is one of a growing number of RSGs shown to have winds that are ionized from the outside in. The fate of this dense wind material is important for models of second generation star formation in massive star clusters. Mackey et al. (2014) showed that external photoionization can stall the wind of RSGs and accumulate mass in a dense static shell. We use 1D R-HD simulations of an externally photoionized wind to predict the Halpha and [NII] emission arising from photoionized winds both with and without a dense shell. We analyse spectra of the Halpha and [NII] emission in the environment around W26 and compare them with predicted synthetic emission. Simulations of slow winds that are decelerated into a dense shell show strongly limb-brightened line emission, with line radial velocities that are independent of the wind speed. Faster winds (>22 km/s) do not form a dense shell, have less limb-brightening, and the line radial velocity is a good tracer of the wind speed. The brightness of the [NII] and Halpha lines as a function of distance from W26 agrees reasonably well with observations when only the line flux is considered. The radial velocity disagrees, however: the brightest observed emission is blueshifted by ~25 km/s relative to the radial velocity of the star, whereas a spherically symmetric wind has the brightest emission at zero radial velocity. Our results show that the bright nebula surrounding W26 must be asymmetric; we suggest it is confined by external ram pressure from the wind of the nearby supergiant W9. We obtain a lower limit on the nitrogen abundance within the nebula of 2.35 times solar. The line ratio strongly favours photoionization over shock ionization, and so even if the observed nebula is pressure confined there should still be an ionization front and a photoionization-confined shell closer to the star.",15,[],1
1501.05577,astro-ph,"Using both numerical and analytical approaches, we demonstrate the existence of an effective power-law relation equation between the mean Lyapunov exponent equation of stellar orbits chaotically scattered by a supermassive black hole in the center of a galaxy and the mass parameter equation, i.e. ratio of the mass of the black hole over the mass of the galaxy. The exponent equation is found numerically to obtain values in the range equation--equation. We propose a theoretical interpretation of these exponents, based on estimates of local `stretching numbers', i.e. local Lyapunov exponents at successive transits of the orbits through the black hole's sphere of influence. We thus predict equation with equation--equation. Our basic model refers to elliptical galaxy models with a central core. However, we find numerically that an effective power law scaling of equation with equation holds also in models with central cusp, beyond a mass scale up to which chaos is dominated by the influence of the cusp itself. We finally show numerically that an analogous law exists also in disc galaxies with rotating bars. In the latter case, chaotic scattering by the black hole affects mainly populations of thick tube-like orbits surrounding some low-order branches of the equation family of periodic orbits, as well as its bifurcations at low-order resonances, mainly the Inner Lindbland resonance and the 4/1 resonance. Implications of the correlations between equation and equation to determining the rate of secular evolution of galaxies are discussed.",15,[],1
1509.05287,astro-ph,"We present the results of SPH simulations in which two clouds, each having mass equation and radius equation, collide head-on at relative velocities of equation. There is a clear trend with increasing equation. At low equation, star formation starts later, and the shock-compressed layer breaks up into an array of predominantly radial filaments; stars condense out of these filaments and fall, together with residual gas, towards the centre of the layer, to form a single large-equation cluster, which then evolves by competitive accretion, producing one or two very massive protostars and a diaspora of ejected (mainly low-mass) protostars; the pattern of filaments is reminiscent of the hub and spokes systems identified recently by observers. At high equation, star formation occurs sooner and the shock-compressed layer breaks up into a network of filaments; the pattern of filaments here is more like a spider's web, with several small-equation clusters forming independently of one another, in cores at the intersections of filaments, and since each core only spawns a small number of protostars, there are fewer ejections of protostars. As the relative velocity is increased, the \it mean protostellar mass increases, but the \it maximum protostellar mass and the width of the mass function both decrease. We use a Minimal Spanning Tree to analyse the spatial distributions of protostars formed at different relative velocities.",15,[],1
1502.01019,astro-ph,"We carry out direct numerical simulations of turbulent astrophysical media that explicitly track ionizations, recombinations, and species-by-species radiative cooling.

In this case, the medium reaches a global steady state that is purely a function of the one-dimensional turbulent velocity dispersion, equation and the product of the mean density and the driving scale of turbulence, equation Our simulations span a grid of models with equation ranging from 6 to 58 km sequation and equation ranging from 10equation to 10equation cmequation which correspond to turbulent Mach numbers from equation to 10.6.

1512.06162,astro-ph,"NASA's exoplanet Discovery mission Kepler was reconstituted as the K2 mission a year after the failure of the 2nd of Kepler's 4 reaction wheels in May 2013. The new spacecraft pointing method now gives typical roll motion of 1.0 pixels peak-to-peak over 6 hours at the edges of the field, two orders of magnitude greater than for Kepler. Despite these roll errors, the flight system and its modified science data processing pipeline restores much of the photometric precision of the primary mission while viewing a wide variety of targets, thus turning adversity into diversity. We define metrics for data compression and pixel budget available in each campaign; the photometric noise on exoplanet transit and stellar activity time scales; residual correlations in corrected long cadence light curves; and the protection of test sinusoidal signals from overfitting in the systematic error removal process. We find that data compression and noise both increase linearly with radial distance from the center of the field of view, with the data compression proportional to star count as well. At the center, where roll motion is nearly negligible, the limiting 6 hour photometric precision for a quiet 12th magnitude star can be as low as 30 ppm, only 25% higher than that of Kepler. This noise performance is achieved without sacrificing signal fidelity; test sinusoids injected into the data are attenuated by less than 10% for signals with periods up 15 days. At time scales relevant to asteroseismology, light curves derived from K2 archive calibrated pixels have high-frequency noise amplitude within 40% of that achieved by Kepler. The improvements in K2 operations and science data analysis resulting from 1.5 yr of experience with this new mission concept, and quantified by the metrics in this paper, will support continuation of K2's already high level of scientific productivity in an extended K2 mission.",15,[],1
1506.05892,astro-ph,"Magnetic cataclysmic variables are close binary systems containing a strongly magnetized white dwarf that accretes matter coming from an M-dwarf companion. High-energy radiation coming from those objects is emitted from the accretion column close to the white dwarf photosphere at the impact region. Its properties depend on the characteristics of the white dwarf and an accurate accretion column model allows the properties of the binary system to be inferred, such as the white dwarf mass, its magnetic field, and the accretion rate. We study the temporal and spectral behaviour of the accretion region and use the tools we developed to accurately connect the simulation results to the X-ray and optical astronomical observations. The radiation hydrodynamics code Hades was adapted to simulate this specific accretion phenomena. Classical approaches were used to model the radiative losses of the two main radiative processes: bremsstrahlung and cyclotron. The oscillation frequencies and amplitudes in the X-ray and optical domains are studied to compare those numerical results to observational ones. Different dimensional formulae were developed to complete the numerical evaluations. The complete characterization of the emitting region is described for the two main radiative regimes: when only the bremsstrahlung losses and when both cyclotron and bremsstrahlung losses are considered. The effect of the non-linear cooling in- stability regime on the accretion column behaviour is analysed. Variation in luminosity on short timescales (~ 1 s quasi-periodic oscillations) is an expected consequence of this specific dynamic. The importance of secondary shock instability on the quasi-periodic oscillation phenomenon is discussed. The stabilization effect of the cyclotron process is confirmed by our numerical simulations, as well as the power distribution in the various modes of oscillation.",15,[],1
1503.02104,astro-ph,"Most of the massive elliptical galaxies in the universe stopped forming stars billions of years ago, even though plenty of hot gas remains available for star formation. Here we present compelling evidence indicating that quenching of star formation depends on both black-hole feedback and Type Ia supernova heating. We analyze Chandra X-ray observations of ten massive ellipticals, five with extended, potentially star-forming multiphase gas and five single-phase ellipticals with no star formation. The ratio of cooling time to freefall time at 1--10 kpc in the multiphase galaxies is tc/tff ~10, indicating that precipitation-driven feedback limits cooling but does not eliminate condensation. In the same region of the single-phase galaxies, the radial profiles of gas entropy are consistent with a thermally stable (tc/tff > 20) supernova-driven outflow that sweeps stellar ejecta out of the galaxy. However, in one of those single-phase ellipticals (NGC 4261) we find tc/tff < 10 at < 300 pc. Notably, its jets are ~50 times more powerful than in the other nine ellipticals, in agreement with models indicating that precipitation near the black hole should switch its fueling mode from Bondi-like accretion to cold chaotic accretion. We conclude by hypothesizing that particularly strong black-hole outbursts can shut off star formation in massive elliptical galaxies by boosting the entropy of the hot gas and flipping the system into the supernova-sweeping state.",15,[],1
1509.01426,astro-ph,"G-band bright points (GBPs) are thought to be the foot-points of magnetic flux tubes. The aim of this paper is to investigate the relation between the diffusion regimes of GBPs and the associated longitudinal magnetic field strengths. Two high resolution observations of different magnetized environments were acquired with the Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope. Each observation was recorded simultaneously with G-band filtergrams and Narrow-band Filter Imager (NFI) Stokes I and V images. GBPs are identified and tracked automatically, and then categorized into several groups by their longitudinal magnetic field strengths, which are extracted from the calibrated NFI magnetograms using a point-by-point method. The Lagrangian approach and the distribution of diffusion indices approach are adopted separately to explore the diffusion regime of GBPs for each group. It is found that the values of diffusion index and diffusion coefficient both decrease exponentially with the increasing longitudinal magnetic field strengths whichever approach is used. The empirical formulas deduced from the fitting equations are proposed to describe these relations. Stronger elements tend to diffuse more slowly than weak elements, independently of the magnetic flux of the surrounding medium. This may be because the magnetic energy of stronger elements is not negligible compared with the kinetic energy of the gas, and therefore the flows cannot perturb them so easily.Yang",15,[],1

Those spanning the period from 7 June 2007 through 9 September 2007 we used to identify and track cloud features, determine atmospheric motions, characterize cloud morphology and dynamics, and define changes in atmospheric band structure. We confirmed the existence of the suspected northern hemisphere prograde jet, locating its peak near 58 N, and extended wind speed measurements to 73 N. For 28 cloud features we obtained extremely high wind-speed accuracy through extended tracking times. The new results confirm a small N-S asymmetry in the zonal wind profile, and the lack of any change in the southern hemisphere between 1986 (near solstice) and 2007 (near equinox) suggests that the asymmetry may be permanent rather than seasonally reversing. In the 2007 images we found two prominent groups of discrete cloud features with very long lifetimes. The one near 30 S has departed from its previous oscillatory motion and started a significant northward drift, accompanied by substantial morphological changes. The complex of features near 30 N remained at a nearly fixed latitude, while exhibiting some characteristics of a dark spot accompanied by bright companion features. Smaller and less stable features were used to track cloud motions at other latitudes, some of which lasted over many planet rotations, though many could not be tracked beyond a single transit.

Here we perform a first-principles study on LaAlOequation/PbTiOequation superlattices. Although neither of the components is magnetic, magnetic moments emerge at the ferroelectric domain walls of PbTiOequation in these superlattices.

1502.03982,cond-mat,"We investigate the relaxation behavior of thin films of a polyamide random copolymer, PA66/6I, with various film thicknesses using dielectric relaxation spectroscopy. Two dielectric signals are observed at high temperatures, the equation-process and the relaxation process due to electrode polarization (the EP-process). The relaxation time of the EP-process has a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann type of temperature dependence, and the glass transition temperature, equation, evaluated from the EP-process agrees very well with the equation determined from the thermal measurements. The fragility index derived from the EP-process increases with decreasing film thickness. The relaxation time and the dielectric relaxation strength of the EP-process are described by a linear function of the film thickness equation for large values of equation, which can be regarded as experimental evidence for the validity of attributing the observed signal to the EP-process. Furthermore, there is distinct deviation from this linear law for thicknesses smaller than a critical value. This deviation observed in thinner films is associated with an increase in the mobility and/or diffusion constant of the charge carriers responsible for the EP-process. The equation-process is located in a high frequency region than the EP-process at high temperatures, but merges with the EP-process at lower temperatures near the glass transition region. The thickness dependence of the relaxation time of the equation-process is different from that of the EP-process.

1509.07297,cond-mat,"To capture various experimental results in the pseudogap regime of the underdoped cuprate superconductors for temperature equation, we propose a four-component pair density wave (PDW) state, in which all components compete with each other. Without random field disorders (RFD), only one of the PDW components survives. If the RFD is included, this state could become phase separated and consist of short range PDW stripes, in which two PDW components coexist but differ in magnitudes, resulting in charge density waves (CDW) and a time-reversal symmetry breaking order, in the form of loop current, as secondary composite orders. We call this phase-separated pair nematic (PSPN) state, which could be responsible for the pseudogap. Using a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau approach and Monte Carlo simulations, we found that in this state, RFD induces short range static CDW with phase-separated patterns in the directional components and the static CDW is destroyed by thermal phase fluctuations at a crossover temperature equation, above which the CDW becomes dynamically fluctuating. The experimentally found CDW with predominantly d-wave form factor constrains the PDW components to have equation pairing symmetries. We also construct a lattice model and compute the spectral functions for the PSPN state and find good agreement with ARPES results.",15,[],8

We found through infrared nano-imaging that bilayer graphene supports plasmons with a higher degree of confinement compared to single- and double-layer graphene, a direct consequence of interlayer tunneling. Moreover, we were able to shut off plasmons in bilayer graphene through gating within a wide voltage range. Theoretical modeling indicates that such a plasmon-off region is directly linked to a gapped insulating state of bilayer graphene: yet another implication of interlayer tunneling.

Moreover, the localized state keeps the shape of the initial state wave function with an exponential tail. In 2D, we analyze the interplay between vorticiy and localization by examining the dispersion of a state containing a vortex on it in a disordered media. Despite localization can be associated to islands of constant phase, the presence of a vortex in the initial state leads to dislocations and phase jumps in the localized state.

Exchange interaction generally suppresses the quasiparticle effective mass in the lowest nanowire subband, and a finite spin splitting is found to significantly increase the magnitude of the quasiparticle-mass suppression (by upto 15\% in the experimentally relevant parameter regime). In contrast, spin-orbit coupling causes a modest (1\%-level) reduction of the magnitude of the exchange energy per particle.

However, whether the competition between these two tendencies can lead to a quantum critical point has been debated over more than two decades. Here, we study this problem by applying the newly proposed natural orbitals renormalization group method to a lattice version of the two-impurity Kondo model with a direct exchange equation between the two impurity spins. The method allows for unbiased accessing the ground state wave functions and low-lying excitations for sufficiently large system sizes. We demonstrate the existence of a quantum critical point, characterized by the power-law divergence of impurity staggered susceptibility with critical exponent equation, on the antiferromagnetic side of equation when the interimpurity distance equation is even lattice spacing, while a crossover behavior is recovered when equation is odd lattice spacing.

1505.04170,cond-mat,"A major puzzle about the nature of the iron-based superconductivity appears in the case of the alkaline iron selenides. Compared to the iron pnictides, these systems have only electron Fermi pockets (i.e. no hole Fermi pockets) but comparable superconducting transition temperatures. The challenge lies in reconciling the two basic experimental features of their superconducting state: a node-less gap and the existence of a resonance in the spin excitation spectrum. We propose a mechanism based on reconstructing two quasi-degenerate pairing states, one in an equation-wave equation channel that is fully gapped, and the other in a equation-wave equation channel whose pairing function changes sign across the electron Fermi pockets at the Brillouin-zone boundary. The resulting intermediate pairing state, which we call an orbital-selective equation state, incorporates both of the above two properties. When the leading spin-singlet pairing is in the equation orbital subspace, this state retains the equation-wave form factor but has a equation symmetry due to an internal equation structure in the orbital space. Within a five-orbital equation model with orbital-selective exchange couplings, we show that the proposed pairing state is energetically competitive over a finite range of control parameters. We calculate the dynamical spin susceptibility in the orbital-selective equation superconducting state and show that a spin resonance arises and has the characteristics of observed by inelastic neutron experiments in the alkaline iron selenides. More generally, the formation of the orbital-selective equation state represents a novel means of relieving the quasi-degeneracy between equation and equationwave pairing states, which is a hitherto unsuspected alternative to the conventional route of linearly superposing the two into a time-reversal symmetry breaking equation state.",15,[],8

In these conditions, the saturated vapor pressure increases by an amount equal to the solute density in liquid multiplied by the large factor equation. As a result, phase separation is induced at low solute densities in liquid and the new phase remains in gaseous states, while the liquid pressure is outside the coexistence curve of the solvent. This explains the widely observed formation of stable nanobubbles in ambient water with a dissolved gas. We calculate the density and stress profiles across planar and spherical interfaces, where the surface tension decreases with increasing the interfacial solute adsorption. We realize stable solute-rich bubbles with radius about 30 nm, which minimize the free energy functional.

We study a model of Majorana fermions coupled to a boson mode and show that the anomalous correlator between different Majorana fermions, located at opposite ends of a topological wire, exhibits odd frequency behavior. It is stabilized when the coupling strength equation is above a critical value equation. We use both, conventional diagrammatic theory and a functional integral approach, to derive the gap equation, the critical temperature, the gap function, the critical coupling, and a Ginzburg-Landau theory allowing to discuss a possible subleading admixture of even-frequency pairing.",15,[],8
1509.04868,cond-mat,"Motivated by the recent experimental observations on clustering of motor proteins on microtubule filament, we study an open system of two parallel totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes under asymmetric coupling conditions, which incorporates the mutual interaction with the surrounding environment through Langmuir Kinetics in both the lanes.

We analyse the model within the framework of continuum mean-field theory and the phase diagrams along with density profiles are obtained using boundary layer analysis. The effect of mutual interactions on the phase diagram for two different situations of attachment and detachment (LK) rates is discussed. Under the symmetric LK dynamics, the topological structure of the phase diagram remains similar to the one in without mutual interaction; while for the antisymmetric case, after a certain critical value of attractive/repulsive mutual attraction, significant changes are found in the qualitative nature of phase diagram. Moreover, it is shown that the type of mutual interaction affects the dynamic properties of motor proteins. The theoretical findings are examined by extensive Monte-Carlo simulations.",15,[],8

Charge transport in these heterostructures is confined to the interfaces and occurs via variable range hopping (VRH). Upon increasing n, the interfacial separation rises, leading to a suppression of the electrostatic screening between carriers of neighboring interfaces and the opening of a Coulomb gap at the Fermi level (EF). The high-field magnetoresistance (MR) is universally negative due to progressive spin alignment. However at a critical thickness of n=5 unit cells (u.c.), an exchange field coupling between ferromagnetically ordered interfaces results in positive MR at low magnetic field (H).

There exist two equilibrium states in the helix wire with easy-tangential anisotropy: a quasi-tangential magnetization distribution in case of relatively small curvatures and torsions, and an onion state in opposite case. In the last case the magnetization is close to tangential one, deviations are caused by the torsion and curvature. Possible equilibrium magnetization states in the helix magnet with different anisotropy directions are studied theoretically.

Using the new method presented in this paper we derive the probabilities (the Green's functions) describing a particle's random walk in the system. Within this method we firstly consider the particle's random walk in a system with both discrete time and space variables in which a particle can vanish due to reactions with constant probabilities equation and equation, defined separately for each medium. Then, we move from discrete to continuous variables. The reactions included in the model play a supporting role. We link the reaction probabilities with the other subdiffusion parameters which characterize the media by means of the formulae presented in this paper. Calculating the generating functions for the difference equations describing the random walk in the composite membrane system with reactions, which depend explicitly on equation and equation, we are able to correctly incorporate the subdiffusion parameters of both the media into the Green's functions. Finally, placing equation into the obtained functions we get the Green's functions for the composite membrane system without any reactions. From the obtained Green's functions, we derive the boundary conditions at the thin membrane. One of the boundary conditions contains the Riemann--Liouville fractional time derivative, which shows that the additional `memory effect' is created in the system.

The obtained model consists of a single conservation law and is on one side simple enough to permit a complete understanding, on the other side reach enough to detect the evolution of the dynamic network.",15,[],7

1512.07344,cs,"A deep generative model is developed for representation and analysis of images, based on a hierarchical convolutional dictionary-learning framework. Stochastic \em unpooling is employed to link consecutive layers in the model, yielding top-down image generation.

Deep deconvolutional inference is employed when testing, to infer the latent features, and the top-layer features are connected with the max-margin classifier for discrimination tasks. The model is efficiently trained using a Monte Carlo expectation-maximization (MCEM) algorithm, with implementation on graphical processor units (GPUs) for efficient large-scale learning, and fast testing.

1504.07339,cs,"Deep learning methods are powerful tools but often suffer from expensive computation and limited flexibility. An alternative is to combine light-weight models with deep representations. As successful cases exist in several visual problems, a unified framework is absent. In this paper, we revisit two widely used approaches in computer vision, namely filtered channel features and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and absorb merits from both by proposing an integrated method called Convolutional Channel Features (CCF). CCF transfers low-level features from pre-trained CNN models to feed the boosting forest model. With the combination of CNN features and boosting forest, CCF benefits from the richer capacity in feature representation compared with channel features, as well as lower cost in computation and storage compared with end-to-end CNN methods. We show that CCF serves as a good way of tailoring pre-trained CNN models to diverse tasks without fine-tuning the whole network to each task by achieving state-of-the-art performances in pedestrian detection, face detection, edge detection and object proposal generation.",15,[],7
1510.07193,cs,"Research into statistical parsing for English has enjoyed over a decade of successful results. However, adapting these models to other languages has met with difficulties. Previous comparative work has shown that Modern Arabic is one of the most difficult languages to parse due to rich morphology and free word order. Classical Arabic is the ancient form of Arabic, and is understudied in computational linguistics, relative to its worldwide reach as the language of the Quran. The thesis is based on seven publications that make significant contributions to knowledge relating to annotating and parsing Classical Arabic.   A central argument of this thesis is that using a hybrid representation closely aligned to traditional grammar leads to improved parsing for Arabic. To test this hypothesis, two approaches are compared. As a reference, a pure dependency parser is adapted using graph transformations, resulting in an 87.47% F1-score. This is compared to an integrated parsing model with an F1-score of 89.03%, demonstrating that joint dependency-constituency parsing is better suited to Classical Arabic.",15,[],7

1509.03602,cs,"Satellite image classification is a challenging problem that lies at the crossroads of remote sensing, computer vision, and machine learning. Due to the high variability inherent in satellite data, most of the current object classification approaches are not suitable for handling satellite datasets. The progress of satellite image analytics has also been inhibited by the lack of a single labeled high-resolution dataset with multiple class labels. The contributions of this paper are twofold - (1) first, we present two new satellite datasets called SAT-4 and SAT-6, and (2) then, we propose a classification framework that extracts features from an input image, normalizes them and feeds the normalized feature vectors to a Deep Belief Network for classification. On the SAT-4 dataset, our best network produces a classification accuracy of 97.95% and outperforms three state-of-the-art object recognition algorithms, namely - Deep Belief Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks and Stacked Denoising Autoencoders by ~11%. On SAT-6, it produces a classification accuracy of 93.9% and outperforms the other algorithms by ~15%.

Our aim is to characterize the minimum index code length that the sender needs to transmit to simultaneously satisfy all user requests. We show that the optimal binary vector index code length is equal to the minimum rank (minrank) of a matrix whose elements consist of the sets of desired packet indices and side- information encoding matrices. This is the natural extension of matrix minrank in the presence of coded side information.

Khot and Regev (2003) proved that the problem is NP-hard to approximate within a factor equation, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC).

Without resorting to the UGC, the best inapproximability result for the problem is due to Dinur and Safra (2002): vertex cover is NP-hard to approximate within a factor 1.3606. We prove the following unconditional result about linear programming (LP) relaxations of the problem: every LP relaxation that approximates vertex cover within a factor equation has super-polynomially many inequalities.

1511.06488,cs,"The complexity of deep neural network algorithms for hardware implementation can be much lowered by optimizing the word-length of weights and signals. Direct quantization of floating-point weights, however, does not show good performance when the number of bits assigned is small. Retraining of quantized networks has been developed to relieve this problem. In this work, the effects of retraining are analyzed for a feedforward deep neural network (FFDNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The network complexity is controlled to know their effects on the resiliency of quantized networks by retraining. The complexity of the FFDNN is controlled by varying the unit size in each hidden layer and the number of layers, while that of the CNN is done by modifying the feature map configuration. We find that the performance gap between the floating-point and the retrain-based ternary (1, 0, -1) weight neural networks exists with a fair amount in 'complexity limited' networks, but the discrepancy almost vanishes in fully complex networks whose capability is limited by the training data, rather than by the number of connections. This research shows that highly complex DNNs have the capability of absorbing the effects of severe weight quantization through retraining, but connection limited networks are less resilient. This paper also presents the effective compression ratio to guide the trade-off between the network size and the precision when the hardware resource is limited.",15,[],7

Our work expands on the work of [1] by considering the entire surface area of digit contact with the smartphone keyboard, rather than interpreting each touch as a single point.

1503.05423,cs,"Motivated by the search for a logic for polynomial time, we study rank logic (FPR) which extends fixed-point logic with counting (FPC) by operators that determine the rank of matrices over finite fields. While FPR can express most of the known queries that separate FPC from PTIME, nearly nothing was known about the limitations of its expressive power.   In our first main result we show that the extensions of FPC by rank operators over different prime fields are incomparable. This solves an open question posed by Dawar and Holm and also implies that rank logic, in its original definition with a distinct rank operator for every field, fails to capture polynomial time. In particular we show that the variant of rank logic FPR* with an operator that uniformly expresses the matrix rank over finite fields is more expressive than FPR.   One important step in our proof is to consider solvability logic FPS which is the analogous extension of FPC by quantifiers which express the solvability problem for linear equation systems over finite fields. Solvability logic can easily be embedded into rank logic, but it is open whether it is a strict fragment. In our second main result we give a partial answer to this question: in the absence of counting, rank operators are strictly more expressive than solvability quantifiers.",15,[],7

We characterize the systems through their fixed points, and equip them with two operators. We uncover properties of the operators, and express global systems through combinations of local systems. We enhance the theory with a notion of failure, and understand the class of shocks inducing a system to failure.

They are especially important for online encyclopedias such as Wikipedia: an article can often only be understood in the context of related articles, and hyperlinks make it easy to explore this context. But important links are often missing, and several methods have been proposed to alleviate this problem by learning a linking model based on the structure of the existing links. Here we propose a novel approach to identifying missing links in Wikipedia. We build on the fact that the ultimate purpose of Wikipedia links is to aid navigation. Rather than merely suggesting new links that are in tune with the structure of existing links, our method finds missing links that would immediately enhance Wikipedia's navigability. We leverage data sets of navigation paths collected through a Wikipedia-based human-computation game in which users must find a short path from a start to a target article by only clicking links encountered along the way. We harness human navigational traces to identify a set of candidates for missing links and then rank these candidates. Experiments show that our procedure identifies missing links of high quality.",15,[],7
1504.07182,cs,"In this paper, we present a probabilistic framework for goal-driven spoken dialog systems. A new dynamic stochastic state (DS-state) is then defined to characterize the goal set of a dialog state at different stages of the dialog process. Furthermore, an entropy minimization dialog management(EMDM) strategy is also proposed to combine with the DS-states to facilitate a robust and efficient solution in reaching a user's goals. A Song-On-Demand task, with a total of 38117 songs and 12 attributes corresponding to each song, is used to test the performance of the proposed approach. In an ideal simulation, assuming no errors, the EMDM strategy is the most efficient goal-seeking method among all tested approaches, returning the correct song within 3.3 dialog turns on average. Furthermore, in a practical scenario, with top five candidates to handle the unavoidable automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU) errors, the results show that only 61.7\% of the dialog goals can be successfully obtained in 6.23 dialog turns on average when random questions are asked by the system, whereas if the proposed DS-states are updated with the top 5 candidates from the SLU output using the proposed EMDM strategy executed at every DS-state, then a 86.7\% dialog success rate can be accomplished effectively within 5.17 dialog turns on average. We also demonstrate that entropy-based DM strategies are more efficient than non-entropy based DM. Moreover, using the goal set distributions in EMDM, the results are better than those without them, such as in sate-of-the-art database summary DM.",15,[],7

1504.04818,cs,"Efficient similarity retrieval from large-scale multimodal database is pervasive in modern search engines and social networks. To support queries across content modalities, the system should enable cross-modal correlation and computation-efficient indexing. While hashing methods have shown great potential in achieving this goal, current attempts generally fail to learn isomorphic hash codes in a seamless scheme, that is, they embed multiple modalities in a continuous isomorphic space and separately threshold embeddings into binary codes, which incurs substantial loss of retrieval accuracy. In this paper, we approach seamless multimodal hashing by proposing a novel Composite Correlation Quantization (CCQ) model. Specifically, CCQ jointly finds correlation-maximal mappings that transform different modalities into isomorphic latent space, and learns composite quantizers that convert the isomorphic latent features into compact binary codes. An optimization framework is devised to preserve both intra-modal similarity and inter-modal correlation through minimizing both reconstruction and quantization errors, which can be trained from both paired and partially paired data in linear time. A comprehensive set of experiments clearly show the superior effectiveness and efficiency of CCQ against the state of the art hashing methods for both unimodal and cross-modal retrieval.",15,[],7

We show that, like the gradient, the Hessian exhibits useful structure in the context of MDPs and we use this analysis to motivate two Gauss-Newton Methods for MDPs. Like the Gauss-Newton method for non-linear least squares, these methods involve approximating the Hessian by ignoring certain terms in the Hessian which are difficult to estimate. The approximate Hessians possess desirable properties, such as negative definiteness, and we demonstrate several important performance guarantees including guaranteed ascent directions, invariance to affine transformation of the parameter space, and convergence guarantees. We finally provide a unifying perspective of key policy search algorithms, demonstrating that our second Gauss-Newton algorithm is closely related to both the EM-algorithm and natural gradient ascent applied to MDPs, but performs significantly better in practice on a range of challenging domains.",15,['stat'],7

Preconditioned Krylov subspace methods are popular for these problems, with BiCGStab and GMRES(m) most frequently used for nonsymmetric systems. BiCGStab is popular because it has cheap iterations, but it may fail for stiff problems, especially early on as the initial guess is far from the solution. Restarted GMRES is better, more robust, in this phase, but restarting may lead to very slow convergence. Therefore, we evaluate the rGCROT method for these systems. This method recycles a selected subspace of the search space (called recycle space) after a restart. This generally improves the convergence drastically compared with GMRES(m). Recycling subspaces is also advantageous for subsequent linear systems, if the matrix changes slowly or is constant. However, rGCROT iterations are still expensive in memory and computation time compared with those of BiCGStab. Hence, we propose a new, hybrid approach that combines the cheap iterations of BiCGStab with the robustness of rGCROT. For the first few time steps the algorithm uses rGCROT and builds an effective recycle space, and then it recycles that space in the rBiCGStab solver. We evaluate rGCROT on a turbulent channel flow problem, and we evaluate both rGCROT and the new, hybrid combination of rGCROT and rBiCGStab on a porous medium flow problem.

For ANA-MACs, we introduce artificial noise to interfere with the complexity-theoretic MACs and quantization is further employed to facilitate packet-based transmission. With a channel coding formulation of key recovery in the MACs, the generation of standard authentication tags can be seen as an encoding process for the ensemble of codes, where the shared key between Alice and Bob is considered as the input and the message is used to specify a code from the ensemble of codes. Then, we show that the introduction of artificial noise in ANA-MACs can be well employed to resist the key recovery attack even if the opponent has an unlimited computing power. Finally, a pragmatic approach for the analysis of ANA-MACs is provided, and we show how to balance the three performance metrics, including the completeness error, the false acceptance probability, and the conditional equivocation about the key.

1505.00267,cs,"An important first step when deploying a wireless ad hoc network is neighbor discovery in which every node attempts to determine the set of nodes it can communicate with in one wireless hop. In the recent years, cognitive radio (CR) technology has gained attention as an attractive approach to alleviate spectrum congestion. A cognitive radio transceiver can operate over a wide range of frequencies, possibly scanning multiple frequency bands. A cognitive radio node can opportunistically utilize unused wireless spectrum without interference from other wireless devices in its vicinity. Due to spatial variations in frequency usage and hardware variations in radio transceivers, different nodes in the network may perceive different subsets of frequencies available to them for communication. This heterogeneity in the available channel sets across the network increases the complexity of solving the neighbor discovery problem in a cognitive radio network. In this work, we design and analyze several randomized algorithms for neighbor discovery in such a (heterogeneous) network under a variety of assumptions (e.g. maximum node degree known or unknown) for both synchronous and asynchronous systems under minimal knowledge.

To build a general model for SSDs remains an important problem in terms of both model fitness and efficiency. We propose a novel method to model the SSDs by a so-called Tag-Weighted Topic Model (TWTM).

Meanwhile, we propose three large-scale solutions for our model under the MapReduce distributed computing platform for modeling large-scale SSDs. The experimental results show the effectiveness, efficiency and the robustness by comparing our model with the state-of-the-art methods in document modeling, tags prediction and text classification.

The generator is used to build a collection of inflected and derived words, which in turn is used by the analyzer. Generating and storing morphological forms along with the corresponding morphological information allows for efficient and simple look up by the analyzer. Indeed, by looking up a word and extracting the attached morphological information, the analyzer does not have to compute this information. As we must, however, assume the lexical database to be incomplete, the system can also work without the dictionary component, using a rule-based approach.",15,[],7

1504.08241,cs,"Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a nature-inspired meta-heuristic for solving continuous optimization problems. In the literature, the potential of the particles of swarm has been used to show that slightly modified PSO guarantees convergence to local optima. Here we show that under specific circumstances the unmodified PSO, even with swarm parameters known (from the literature) to be good, almost surely does not yield convergence to a local optimum is provided. This undesirable phenomenon is called stagnation. For this purpose, the particles' potential in each dimension is analyzed mathematically. Additionally, some reasonable assumptions on the behavior if the particles' potential are made. Depending on the objective function and, interestingly, the number of particles, the potential in some dimensions may decrease much faster than in other dimensions. Therefore, these dimensions lose relevance, i.e., the contribution of their entries to the decisions about attractor updates becomes insignificant and, with positive probability, they never regain relevance. If Brownian Motion is assumed to be an approximation of the time-dependent drop of potential, practical, i.e., large values for this probability are calculated. Finally, on chosen multidimensional polynomials of degree two, experiments are provided showing that the required circumstances occur quite frequently. Furthermore, experiments are provided showing that even when the very simple sphere function is processed the described stagnation phenomenon occurs. Consequently, unmodified PSO does not converge to any local optimum of the chosen functions for tested parameter settings.",15,[],7

1501.01070,cs,"Many modern applications require the evaluation of analytical queries on large amounts of data. Such queries entail joins and heavy aggregations that often include user-defined functions (UDFs). The most efficient way to process these specific type of queries is using tree execution plans. In this work, we develop an engine for analytical query processing and a suite of specialized techniques that collectively take advantage of the tree form of such plans. The engine executes these tree plans in an elastic IaaS cloud infrastructure and dynamically adapts by allocating and releasing pertinent resources based on the query workload monitored over a sliding time window. The engine offers its services for a fee according to service-level agreements (SLAs) associated with the incoming queries; its management of cloud resources aims at maximizing the profit after removing the costs of using these resources. We have fully implemented our algorithms in the Exareme dataflow processing system.

1501.02287,cs,"It has long been recognized that aortic root elasticity helps to ensure efficient aortic valve closure, but our understanding of the functional importance of the elasticity and geometry of the aortic root continues to evolve as increasingly detailed in vivo imaging data become available. Herein, we describe fluid-structure interaction models of the aortic root, including the aortic valve leaflets, the sinuses of Valsalva, the aortic annulus, and the sinotubular junction, that employ a version of Peskin's immersed boundary (IB) method with a finite element (FE) description of the structural elasticity. We develop both an idealized model of the root with three-fold symmetry of the aortic sinuses and valve leaflets, and a more realistic model that accounts for the differences in the sizes of the left, right, and noncoronary sinuses and corresponding valve cusps. As in earlier work, we use fiber-based models of the valve leaflets, but this study extends earlier IB models of the aortic root by employing incompressible hyperelastic models of the mechanics of the sinuses and ascending aorta using a constitutive law fit to experimental data from human aortic root tissue. In vivo pressure loading is accounted for by a backwards displacement method that determines the unloaded configurations of the root models. Our models yield realistic cardiac output at physiological pressures, with low transvalvular pressure differences during forward flow, minimal regurgitation during valve closure, and realistic pressure loads when the valve is closed during diastole. Further, results from high-resolution computations demonstrate that IB models of the aortic valve are able to produce essentially grid-converged dynamics at practical grid spacings for the high-Reynolds number flows of the aortic root.",15,"['math', 'q-bio']",7

To learn such models, the data samples are often clustered using the K-means algorithm with the Euclidean distance as a dissimilarity metric. However, the Euclidean distance may not always be a good dissimilarity measure for comparing data samples lying on a manifold. In this paper, we propose two algorithms for determining a local subset of training samples from which a good local model can be computed for reconstructing a given input test sample, where we take into account the underlying geometry of the data. The first algorithm, called Adaptive Geometry-driven Nearest Neighbor search (AGNN), is an adaptive scheme which can be seen as an out-of-sample extension of the replicator graph clustering method for local model learning. The second method, called Geometry-driven Overlapping Clusters (GOC), is a less complex nonadaptive alternative for training subset selection.

In this paper we design bidirectional link selection schemes by selecting a pair of transmit and receive antenna at both ends for communications in each direction to maximize the weighted sum rate or minimize the weighted sum symbol error rate (SER). The optimal selection schemes require exhaustive search, so they are highly complex. To tackle this problem, we propose a Serial-Max selection algorithm, which approaches the exhaustive search methods with much lower complexity. In the Serial-Max method, the antenna pairs with maximum ""obtainable SINR"" at both ends are selected in a two-step serial way. The performance of the proposed Serial-Max method is analyzed, and the closed-form expressions of the average weighted sum rate and the weighted sum SER are derived.

1503.00673,cs,"There is considerable and growing interest in the emergence of novel technologies, especially from the policy-making perspective. Yet as an area of study, emerging technologies lacks key foundational elements, namely a consensus on what classifies a technology as 'emergent' and strong research designs that operationalize central theoretical concepts. The present paper aims to fill this gap by developing a definition of 'emerging technologies' and linking this conceptual effort with the development of a framework for the operationalisation of technological emergence. The definition is developed by combining a basic understanding of the term and in particular the concept of 'emergence' with a review of key innovation studies dealing with definitional issues of technological emergence. The resulting definition identifies five attributes that feature in the emergence of novel technologies. These are: (i) radical novelty, (ii) relatively fast growth, (iii) coherence, (iv) prominent impact, and (v) uncertainty and ambiguity. The framework for operationalising emerging technologies is then elaborated on the basis of the proposed attributes. To do so, we identify and review major empirical approaches (mainly in, although not limited to, the scientometric domain) for the detection and study of emerging technologies (these include indicators and trend analysis, citation analysis, co-word analysis, overlay mapping, and combinations thereof) and elaborate on how these can be used to operationalise the different attributes of emergence.",15,[],7

Furthermore, the non-parametric character of the proposed approach allows it to infer the correct size of the dictionary. We exploit the aforementioned Bernoulli distributions in separately learning a linear classifier. The classifier uses the same hierarchical Bayesian model as the dictionary, which we present along the analytical inference solution for Gibbs sampling. For classification, a test instance is first sparsely encoded over the learned dictionary and the codes are fed to the classifier.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate the benefits and impacts of each approach, taking into account models and metrics inherent to the mobility. In this paper, we propose a simplified implementation of mobility support in OpenWiMesh and evaluate its performance compared to other protocols, using differents mobility and data traffic models.

While deep networks have markedly improved general recognition, many approaches to fine-grained recognition rely on anchoring networks to parts for better accuracy. Identifying parts to find correspondence discounts pose variation so that features can be tuned to appearance. To this end previous methods have examined how to find parts and extract pose-normalized features. These methods have generally separated fine-grained recognition into stages which first localize parts using hand-engineered and coarsely-localized proposal features, and then separately learn deep descriptors centered on inferred part positions. We unify these steps in an end-to-end trainable network supervised by keypoint locations and class labels that localizes parts by a fully convolutional network to focus the learning of feature representations for the fine-grained classification task.

The need for expensive object annotations prevents the wide usage of these methods. Instead, we propose to select useful parts from multi-scale part proposals in objects, and use them to compute a global image representation for categorization. This is specially designed for the annotation-free fine-grained categorization task, because useful parts have shown to play an important role in existing annotation-dependent works but accurate part detectors can be hardly acquired. With the proposed image representation, we can further detect and visualize the key (most discriminative) parts in objects of different classes.

In this paper we refute the claim made by Yang et. al. that co-rotating DMs of near-extremal black holes are restricted to the limited range equation, where equation is the dimensionless ratio between the azimuthal harmonic index equation and the spheroidal harmonic index equation of the perturbation mode. In particular, we use an analytical formula originally derived by Detweiler in order to prove the existence of DMs (damped quasinormal resonances which are characterized by finite equation values in the equation limit) of near-extremal black holes in the equation regime, the regime which was claimed by Yang et. al. not to contain damped modes. We show that these co-rotating DMs (in the regime equation) are expected to characterize the resonance spectra of rapidly-rotating (near-extremal) black holes with equation.",15,"['astro-ph', 'hep-th']",13
1504.01772,gr-qc,"We investigate in which cases a singular evolution with a singularity of Type IV, can be consistently incorporated in deformations of the equation inflationary potential. After demonstrating the difficulties that the single scalar field description is confronted with, we use a general two scalar fields model without other matter fluids, to describe the Type IV singular evolution, with one of the two scalar fields being canonical. By appropriately choosing the non-canonical scalar field, we show that the canonical scalar field corresponds to a potential that is nearly the equation inflation potential. If the Type IV singularity occurs at the end of inflation, the Universe's dynamical evolution near inflation is determined effectively by the canonical scalar field and at late-time the evolution is effectively determined by the non-canonical scalar. We also discuss the evolution of the Universe in terms of the effective equation of state and we show that the Type IV singularity, that occurs at the end of inflation, drives late-time acceleration. If however the singularity occurs at late-time, this might affect the inflationary era. We also investigate which Jordan frame pure equation gravity corresponds to the nearly equation inflation scalar potentials we found. The stability of the solutions in the two scalar fields case is also studied and also we investigate how Type IV singularities can be incorporated in certain limiting cases of equation gravity in the Einstein frame.

In equation dimensions, two kinds of cosmological billiards are considered: the so-called 'big billiard' which accounts for pure gravity, and the 'small billiard', which is a symmetry-reduced version of the previous one, and is obtained when the 'symmetry walls' are considered. The solution of Einstein field equations is this way mapped to the (discrete) Poincar\'e map of a billiard ball on the sides of a triangular billiard table, in the Upper Poincar\'e Half Plane (UPHP). The billiard modular group is the scheme within which the dynamics of classical chaotic systems on surfaces of constant negative curvature is analyzed. The periodic orbits of the two kinds of billiards are classified, according to the different symmetry-quotienting mechanisms. The differences with the description implied by the billiard modular group are investigated and outlined.

The cosmic nonbirefringent propagation of photons independent of energy and polarization verifies the Galileo Equivalence Principle [Universality of Propagation] for photons/electromagnetic wave packets in spacetime. This nonbirefringence constrains the spacetime constitutive tensor to high precision to a core metric form with an axion degree and a dilaton degree of freedom. Thus comes the metric with axion and dilation. Constraints on axion and dilaton from astrophysical/cosmic propagation are reviewed. Eotvos-type experiments, Hughes-Drever-type experiments, redshift experiments then constrain and tie this core metric to agree with the matter metric, and hence a unique physical metric and universality of metrology. We summarize these experiments and review how the Galileo equivalence principle constrains the Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP) theoretically.

Using the Hamiltonian approach for geometrical optics in a medium in the presence of gravity, an exact formula for the photon deflection angle by a black hole (or another body with a Schwarzschild metric) embedded in plasma with a spherically symmetric density distribution is derived. The deflection angle in this case is determined by the mutual combination of different factors: gravity, dispersion, and refraction. While the effects of deflection by the gravity in vacuum and the refractive deflection in a nonhomogeneous medium are well known, the new effect is that, in the case of a homogeneous plasma, in the absence of refractive deflection, the gravitational deflection differs from the vacuum deflection and depends on the photon frequency. In the presence of a plasma nonhomogeneity, the chromatic refractive deflection also occurs, so the presence of plasma always makes gravitational lensing chromatic. In particular, the presence of plasma leads to different angular positions of the same image if it is observed at different wavelengths. It is discussed in detail how to apply the presented formulas for the calculation of the deflection angle in different situations. Gravitational lensing in plasma beyond the weak deflection approximation is also considered.",15,['astro-ph'],13

In principle, if the RGWs are strong enough today, they can be detected by timing a single millisecond pulsar with high precision after the intrinsic red noise in pulsar timing residuals were understood, even though observing simultaneously multiple millisecond pulsars is a more powerful technique in extracting gravitational wave signals. We corrected the normalization of RGWs using observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which leads to the amplitudes of RGWs being reduced by two orders of magnitude or so compared to our previous works.

1504.07660,gr-qc,"A future holographic screen is a hypersurface of indefinite signature, foliated by marginally trapped surfaces with area equation. We prove that equation grows strictly monotonically. Future holographic screens arise in gravitational collapse. Past holographic screens exist in our own universe; they obey an analogous area law. Both exist more broadly than event horizons or dynamical horizons. Working within classical General Relativity, we assume the null curvature condition and certain generiticity conditions. We establish several nontrivial intermediate results. If a surface equation divides a Cauchy surface into two disjoint regions, then a null hypersurface equation that contains equation splits the entire spacetime into two disjoint portions: the future-and-interior, equation; and the past-and-exterior, equation. If a family of surfaces equation foliate a hypersurface, while flowing everywhere to the past or exterior, then the future-and-interior equation grows monotonically under inclusion. If the surfaces equation are marginally trapped, we prove that the evolution must be everywhere to the past or exterior, and the area theorem follows. A thermodynamic interpretation as a Second Law is suggested by the Bousso bound, which relates equation to the entropy on the null slices equation foliating the spacetime. In a companion letter, we summarize the proof and discuss further implications.",15,['hep-th'],13

This ""ponderable aether theory"" is almost the same as Einstein-aether theory (where the aether vector is dynamical), but involves additional integration constants arising due to the loss of initial value constraints. One of these produces an effective energy density for the aether fluid, similar to the appearance of dark matter in projectable Ho\vrava gravity and the mimetic dark matter theory. Here we investigate the extent to which this energy density can reproduce the phenomenology of dark matter. Although it is indistinguishable from cold dark matter in homogeneous, isotropic cosmology, it encounters phenomenological problems in both spherically symmetric configurations and cosmological perturbations. Furthermore, inflationary considerations lead us to expect a tiny value for the ponderable aether energy density today unless a sourcing effect is added to the theory. The theory then effectively reduces to dynamical Einstein-aether theory, rendering moot the question of whether an aether must be dynamical in order to be consistent.",15,"['astro-ph', 'hep-th']",13

1507.06662,gr-qc,"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are luminous enough to be detectable up to redshift equation. They are often proposed as complementary tools to type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in tracing the Hubble diagram of the Universe. The distance calibrations of GRBs usually make use one or some of the empirical luminosity correlations, such as equation, equation, equation, equation, equation and equation relations. These calibrating methods are based on the underling assumption that the empirical luminosity correlations are universal over all redshift range. In this paper, we test the possible redshift dependence of six luminosity correlations by dividing GRBs into low-equation and high-equation classes according to their redshift smaller or larger than 1.4. It is shown that the equation relation for low-equation GRBs is consistent with that for high-equation GRBs within equation uncertainty. The intrinsic scatter of equation relation is too larger to make a convincing conclusion. For the rest four correlations, however, low-equation GRBs differ from high-equation GRBs at more than equation confidence level. As such, we calibrate GRBs using the equation relation in a model-independent way. The constraint of high-equation GRBs on the equationCDM model gives equation, well consistent with the Planck 2015 results.",15,[],13

We also take into account the radiation content of the Universe. Here by the late stage of the evolution we refer to the epoch where CDM is already clustered into inhomogeneously distributed discrete structures (galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies). Under this condition the mechanical approach is an adequate tool to study the Universe deep inside the cell of uniformity. More precisely, we study scalar perturbations of the FLRW metric due to inhomogeneities of CDM as well as fluctuations of radiation and DE. For an arbitrary equation of state for DE we obtain a system of equations for the scalar perturbations within the mechanical approach. First, in the case of a constant DE equation of state parameter equation, we demonstrate that our method singles out the cosmological constant as the only viable dark energy candidate. Then, we apply our approach to variable equation of state parameters in the form of three different linear parametrizations of equation, e.g., the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder perfect fluid model.

Using a more comprehensive set of EOSs, we re-examine some proposed linearizations that describe the equation-mode parameters in terms of mass and radius of the neutron star (NS), and we test a more recent proposal for expressing the equation-mode parameters as quadratic functions of the effective compactness. Our extensive results for each equation of state considered allow us to study the accuracy of each proposal. In particular, we find that the damping time deviates quite considerably from the proposed linearization. We introduce a new universal relation for the product of the equation-mode frequency and damping time as a function of the (ordinary) compactness, which proved to be more accurate. The relations using the effective compactness on the other hand also fit our data accurately. Our results show that the maximum oscillation frequency depends strongly on the EOS, such that the measurement of a high oscillation frequency would rule out several EOSs.

Both violating (big-bang) and non-violating (phantom) null energy condition models appear.

In order to get an insight into the key idea, we consider the doubleverse with the same geometrical evolution of the two ""parallel"" universes with their physical evolution (physical coupling constants equation and equation) being different. An interesting point is that there is a possibility to exchange the universes at the point of maximum expansion -- the fact which was already noticed in quantum cosmology.

Such relations are similar to the black hole no-hair theorems, but these possess event horizons inside which information that led to their formation can hide. Compact stars do not possess horizons, so whether their no-hair relations are related to the black hole ones is unclear. We investigate how the two relations are related by studying relations among multipole moments for compact stars with anisotropic pressure as a toy model, which allows such stars to be more compact than those with isotropic pressure. We here show numerically that the compact star no-hair relations approach the black hole ones as the compactness approaches that of a black hole. We also prove analytically that the current dipole moment exactly reaches the black hole limit quadratically in compactness as strongly-anisotropic stars approach the black hole limit.

(ii) It varies with time and attains a global maximum after some time and then asymptotically converges to zero.

Such a time dilation effect holds also for photons and is often referred to as the gravitational time delay (or the Shapiro time delay). Correspondingly, the phase of the GW from the NS shifts due to the Coulomb type gravitational potential of the NS, and the resulting logarithmic phase shift depends on the mass, the spin frequency of the NS, and the distance to the NS. We show that the NS mass can, in principle, be obtained by making use of the phase shift difference between two modes of the continuous GW such as once and twice spin frequency modes induced by a freely precessing NS or a NS containing a pinned superfluid core.

Within General Relativity such approximation is good and leads to no loss of accuracy in the estimation of observables. We find, however, that mass terms and non-linearities in the equations of motion lead to propagation and dispersion velocities significantly different from the speed of light. As the group velocity is the one associated to the propagation of signals, a reduction of its value has direct impact on the behavior and dynamics of nonlinear structures within modified gravity theories with screening. For instance, the internal dynamics of galaxies and satellites submerged in large dark matter halos could be affected by the fact that the group velocity is smaller than the speed of light.

Systematic uncertainties from the expected values has limited the sensitivity of this approach. Observation at multiple distances can remove the normalization uncertainty by isolating the distance dependence. This doesn't work for high equation sterile neutrinos since they are fully mixed at most observation distances and only shift the normalization of the flux.

The dynamical origin implies that the effects of such operators are suppressed by the ratio of either the light fermion masses or the supersymmetry breaking scale to the mediation scale, thereby providing a natural explanation for the smallness of R-parity violation. We consider various scenarios, classified by whether R-parity violation, flavor breaking and/or supersymmetry breaking are mediated by the same messenger fields.

Furthermore, we extrapolate the formalism to study the four-body, five-body and six-body systems, containing one equation meson and multi-equation mesons. In our research, without introducing any free parameters, we generate the equation state in the three-body interaction with the mass of 1707 MeV and a width about 113 MeV, which are consistent with the experiments. We also find a clear resonant structure in our results of the five-body interaction, with a mass 2505 MeV and a width about 32 MeV or more, which is associated to the equation state, where we obtain consistent results with the experimental findings.

Those are the octant of equation, the sign of equation and the neutrino mass ordering. Determining those unknowns is expected to be useful in order to distinguish neutrino mass models. Therefore it may be interesting to know how robust the predictions of a mass matrix for the octant of equation or the neutrino mass ordering are. By applying general multiplicative perturbations we explicitly quantify how probable it is that a perturbed mass matrix predicts an octant of equation different from the original mass matrix, or even a neutrino mass ordering different from the original one. Both the general case and an explicit flavor symmetry model are studied. We give the probabilities as a function of the smallest neutrino mass, showing that for values exceeding 0.1 eV the chance to switch the prediction quickly approaches equation.",15,['hep-ex'],2
1509.03628,hep-ph,"Many models of dark matter scattering with baryons may be treated either as a simple contact interaction or as the exchange of a light mediator particle. We study an alternative, in which a continuum of light mediator states may be exchanged. This could arise, for instance, from coupling to a sector which is approximately conformal at the relevant momentum transfer scale. In the non-relativistic effective theory of dark matter-baryon scattering, which is useful for parametrizing direct detection signals, the effect of such continuum mediators is to multiply the amplitude by a function of the momentum transfer q, which in the simplest case is just a power law. We develop the basic framework and study two examples: the case where the mediator is a scalar operator coupling to the Higgs portal (which turns out to be highly constrained) and the case of an antisymmetric tensor operator equation that mixes with the hypercharge field strength and couples to dark matter tensor currents, which has an interesting viable parameter space. We describe the effect of such mediators on the cross sections and recoil energy spectra that could be observed in direct detection.",15,['astro-ph'],2

The map of the lifetimes of the vacua of the SM enhanced by nonrenormalizable scalar couplings has been compiled to show how new interactions modify stability of the electroweak vacuum. Whereas it is possible to stabilize the SM by adding Planck scale suppressed interactions and taking into account running of the new couplings, the generic effect is shortening the lifetime and hence further destabilisation of the SM electroweak vacuum. Absolute stability can be achieved by lowering the suppression scale of higher order operators while picking up such combinations of new couplings, which do not generate new deep minima in the potential.

1512.07468,hep-ph,The ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC have found significant excess in the diphoton invariant mass distribution near 750 GeV. We interpret this excess in a predictive nonsupersymmetric SU(5) grand unified framework with a singlet scalar and light adjoint fermions. The 750 GeV resonance is identified as a gauge singlet scalar. Both its production and decays are induced by 24 dimensional adjoint fermions predicted within SU(5). The adjoint fermions are assumed to be odd under equation symmetry which forbids their direct coupling to the standard model fermions. We show that the observed diphoton excess can be explained with sub-TeV adjoint fermions and with perturbative Yukawa coupling. A narrow width scenario is more preferred while a simultaneous explanation of observed cross section and large total decay width requires some of the adjoint fermions lighter than 375 GeV. The model also provides a singlet fermion as a candidate of cold dark matter. The gauge coupling unification is achieved in the framework by introducing color sextet scalars while being consistent with the proton decay constraint.,15,[],2

From the discussion on the non-analyticity and methods used in lattice QCD simulations, e.g., Taylor expansion, and the analytic continuation with an imaginary chemical potential, it turns out that information on an inhomogeneous chiral condensed phase is missed in the lattice simulations at finite baryon chemical potentials unless the non-analyticity at zero chemical potential is correctly considered.

This matrix can be decomposed into two different linearly independent contributions. The origin for such two independent contributions can be naturally explained by what we shall call the flavor-blind principle. This principle states that Yukawa couplings shall be either flavor-blind or decomposed into several sets obeying distinct permutation symmetries. In general, it is shown that the symmetry properties of the introduced set of Yukawa matrices follow for equation fermion families the unique sequential breaking equation. The particular case of three fermion families explains why the four mass ratios parametrization that we recently proposed can be used even in the case of no hierarchical masses.",15,[],2

The annihilation amplitudes are found to be small as expected. Several CP violating relations predicted by equation flavor symmetry are in good agreement with data. Current available data can give constraints on the amplitudes which induce equation decays in the framework of equation flavor symmetry, and can also determine the equation mixing angle equation with equation.

1505.06336,hep-ph,"Four-point functions are at the heart of many interesting physical processes. A prime example is the light-by-light scattering amplitude, which plays an important role in the calculation of hadronic contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. In the calculation of such quantities one faces the challenge of finding a suitable and well-behaved basis of tensor structures in coordinate and/or momentum space. Provided all (or many) of the external legs represent similar particle content, a powerful tool to construct and organize such bases is the permutation group S4. We introduce an efficient notation for dealing with the irreducible multiplets of S4, and we highlight the merits of this treatment by exemplifying four-point functions with gauge-boson legs such as the four-gluon vertex and the light-by-light scattering amplitude. The multiplet analysis is also useful for isolating the important kinematic regions and the dynamical singularity content of such amplitudes. Our analysis serves as a basis for future efficient calculations of these and similar objects.",15,"['hep-lat', 'hep-th', 'nucl-th']",2

Consequently, the Higgs field may develop a large vacuum expectation value during inflation. The relaxation of the Higgs field from its large postinflationary value to the minimum of the effective potential represents an important stage in the evolution of the universe. During this epoch, the time-dependent Higgs condensate can create an effective chemical potential for the lepton number, leading to a generation of the lepton asymmetry in the presence of some large right-handed Majorana neutrino masses. Electroweak sphalerons redistribute this asymmetry between leptons and baryons.

1508.06424,hep-ph,"Low energy QCD (below 2 GeV) is a region of resonance dynamics, sometimes lacking satisfactory description as compared to precision of available experimental data. Hadronic equation decays offer a probe for such energy regime. In general, predictions for decays are model dependent, with parameters fitted to experimental results. Parameterizations differ by amount of assumptions and theoretical requirements taken into account. Both model distributions and acquired data samples used for fits are results of complex effort.   In this paper, we investigate main parameterizations of equation decay matrix elements for the one- and three-prong channels of three-pion equation decays. Differences in analytical forms of the currents and resulting distributions used for comparison with the experimental data are studied. We use invariant mass spectra of all possible pion pairs and the whole three-pion system. Also three-dimensional histograms spanned over all distinct squared invariant masses are used to represent results of models and experimental data.   We present distributions from \tt TAUOLA Monte Carlo generation and semi-analytical calculation. These are necessary steps in development for fitting in as model-independent way as possible, and to explore multi-million event experimental data samples.

1506.07164,hep-ph,"Following the recent success of anisotropic hydrodynamics we propose a new, general prescription for the hydrodynamics expansion around an anisotropic background. The anisotropic distribution is fixing exactly the complete energy-momentum tensor, just like the effective temperature is fixing the proper energy density in the ordinary expansion around local equilibrium. This means that momen- tum anisotropies are already included at the leading order, allowing for large pressure anisotropies without the need of a next to leading order treatment. The first moment of the Boltzmann equation (local four-momentum conservation) provides the time evolution of the proper energy density and the four velocity. Differently from previous prescriptions, the dynamic equations for the pressure corrections are not derived from the zeroth or second moment of the Boltzmann equation, but they are taken directly from the exact evolution given by the Boltzmann equation.

This demand translates into two constraints, or consistency conditions, on the scalar potential which are generically: 1) the distance in field space between the de Sitter vacuum and any other vacuum with negative cosmological constant must be of the order of the reduced Planck mass or larger and 2) the fourth root of the vacuum energy density of the de Sitter vacuum must be smaller than the fourth root of the typical scale of the scalar potential. These consistency conditions shed a different light on both outstanding hierarchy problems of the Standard Model of particle physics: the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking and the scale of the cosmological constant.

We calculate all finite-temperature worldline instantons, their actions and fluctuations prefactors, thus determining the complete one-loop decay rate at finite temperature. The thermal contribution to the decay rate becomes nonzero at a threshold temperature equation, above which it dominates the zero temperature result. This is the lowest of an infinite set of thresholds at equation. The decay rate is singular at each threshold as a consequence of the failure of the quadratic approximation to the worldline path integral. We argue that that higher-order effects will make the decay rates finite everywhere, and model those effects by the inclusion of hard thermal loop damping rates.

In a quantumly entangled system, the non-negativity of the relative entropy leads to the entanglement entropy bound. When the entanglement entropy bound is saturated, a quantum system satisfies the thermodynamics-like law with an appropriately defined entanglement temperature. We show that the saturation of the entanglement entropy bound accounts for a universal feature of the entanglement temperature proportional to the inverse of the system size. In addition, we show that the deformed modular Hamiltonian under a global quench also satisfies the generalized entanglement entropy boundary after introducing a new quantity called the entanglement chemical potential.",15,[],4

In field theory, the total partition function splits in a natural way in a piece that does not contain surface terms and a piece consisting of solely the so-called edge states. For open strings, we illustrate that surface contributions to the higher spin fields correspond to open strings piercing the Rindler origin, unifying the higher spin surface contributions in string language. For closed strings, we demonstrate that the string partition function is not quite the same as the sum over the partition functions of the fields in the spectrum: an infinite overcounting is present for the latter. Next we study the partition functions obtained by excluding the surface terms. Using recent results of JHEP 1505 (2015) 106, this construction, first done by Emparan, can be put on much firmer ground. We generalize to type II and heterotic superstrings and demonstrate modular invariance. All of these exhibit an IR divergence that can be interpreted as a maximal acceleration close to the black hole horizon. Ultimately, since these partition functions are only part of the full story, divergences here should not be viewed as a failure of string theory: maximal acceleration is a feature of a faulty treatment of the higher spin fields in the string spectrum.

The 2- and 3-point functions, viewed as functions of the exactly marginal coupling constant and theta angle, obey the tt* equations. In the case at hand, the tt* equations form a set of complicated non-linear coupled matrix equations. We point out that there is an ad hoc self-consistent ansatz that reduces this set of partial differential equations to a sequence of decoupled semi-infinite Toda chains, similar to the one encountered previously in the special case of SU(2) gauge group. This ansatz requires a surprising new non-renormalization theorem in equation superconformal field theories. We derive a general 3-loop perturbative formula for 2- and 3-point functions in the equation chiral ring of the SU(N) theory, and in all explicitly computed examples we find agreement with the tt* equations, as well as the above-mentioned ansatz. This is suggestive evidence for an interesting non-perturbative conjecture about the structure of the equation chiral ring in this class of theories. We discuss several implications of this conjecture. For example, it implies that the holonomy of the vector bundles of chiral primaries over the superconformal manifold is reducible.

We compare a recently proposed model of semiclassical black hole evaporation to the two established models. In particular, we study the density matrix of the outgoing radiation and determine how the magnitude of the off-diagonal corrections differs for the three frameworks. For Hawking's model, we find power-law corrections to the two-point functions that induce exponentially suppressed corrections to the off-diagonal elements of the full density matrix. This verifies that the Hawking result is correct to all orders in perturbation theory and also allows one to express the full density matrix in terms of the single-particle density matrix. We then consider the semiclassical theory for which the corrections, being non-perturbative from an effective field-theory perspective, are much less suppressed and grow monotonically in time. In this case, the R\'enyi entropy for the outgoing radiation is shown to grow linearly at early times; but this growth slows down and the entropy eventually starts to decrease at the Page time.

The motivation stems from urgent need to understand the global dynamics of biologically relevant signal transduction/gene regulatory networks that have at least 5 to 10 nodes, involve multiple interactions, and decades of parameters.   The input to the database computations is a regulatory network, i.e.\ a directed graph with edges indicating up or down regulation, from which a computational model based on switching networks is generated. The phase space dimension equals the number of nodes. The associated parameter space consists of one parameter for each node (a decay rate), and three parameters for each edge (low and high levels of expression, and a threshold at which expression levels change). Since the nonlinearities of switching systems are piece-wise constant, there is a natural decomposition of phase space into cells from which the dynamics can be described combinatorially in terms of a state transition graph. This in turn leads to compact representation of the global dynamics called an annotated Morse graph that identifies recurrent and nonrecurrent. The focus of this paper is on the construction of a natural computable finite decomposition of parameter space into domains where the annotated Morse graph description of dynamics is constant.   We use this decomposition to construct an SQL database that can be effectively searched for dynamic signatures such as bistability, stable or unstable oscillations, and stable equilibria.

1511.08905,math,"We consider solving a convex, possibly stochastic optimization problem over a randomly time-varying multi-agent network. Each agent has access to some local objective function, and it only has unbiased estimates of the gradients of the smooth component. We develop a dynamic stochastic proximal-gradient consensus (DySPGC) algorithm, with the following key features: i) it works for both the static and certain randomly time-varying networks, ii) it allows the agents to utilize either the exact or stochastic gradient information, iii) it is convergent with provable rate. In particular, we show that the proposed algorithm converges to a global optimal solution, with a rate of equation [resp. equation] when the exact (resp. stochastic) gradient is available, where r is the iteration counter.   Interestingly, the developed algorithm bridges a number of (seemingly unrelated) distributed optimization algorithms, such as the EXTRA (Shi et al. 2014), the PG-EXTRA (Shi et al. 2015), the IC/IDC-ADMM (Chang et al. 2014), and the DLM (Ling et al. 2015) and the classical distributed subgradient method.

We use the coherence function to illustrate fundamental limitations on a number of previously proposed constructions for multivariate processes, suggesting these options are not viable for real data.

The 3-D N-S equation is super-critical with respect to the standard L2 a priori estimates; the regular approximating problem in 3-D should contain fractional power with s > 5/4.   Using Dan Henry's semigroup approach we construct regular solutions to such approximations. The solutions are unique, smooth and regularized through the equation in time. Solution to 2-D and 3-D N-S equations are obtained next as a limit of the regular solutions of the above approximations.",15,['math'],3

These potentials are rational extensions of the existing shape invariant potentials. The method is elucidated using the radial oscillator and the trigonometric Poschl-Teller potentials. For the case of radial oscillator, in addition to the known rational extensions, we construct two infinite sets of rational extensions, which seem to be less studied. For one of the potential, we show that its solutions involve a third type of exceptional Laguerre polynomials.

The partition functions solves the stochastic heat equation in full-space or half-space with mixed boundary condition at the origin; or equivalently the free energy satisfies the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.   We derive exact formulas for the Laplace transforms of the partition functions.

This paper continues this exploration by examination of the effect of space and time dependent number scaling on theoretical descriptions of some physical and geometric quantities. Fiber bundles provide a good framework to introduce a space and time or space time dependent number scaling field. The effect of the scaling field on a few nonlocal physical and geometric quantities is described. The effect on gauge theories is to introduce a new complex scalar field into the derivatives appearing in Lagrangians. U(1) invariance of Lagrangian terms does not affect the real part of the scaling field. For this field, any mass is possible. The scaling field is also shown to affect quantum wave packets and path lengths, and geodesic equations even on flat space. Scalar fields described so far in physics, are possible candidates for the scaling field. The lack of direct evidence for the field in physics restricts the scaling field in that the gradient of the field must be close to zero in a local region of cosmological space and time. There are no restrictions outside the region. It is also seen that the scaling field does not affect comparisons of computation or measurements outputs with one another.

This leads to a new, infinite family of solvable spectral problems: the Fredholm determinants of these operators can be found explicitly in terms of Gromov-Witten invariants and their refinements; their spectrum is encoded in exact quantization conditions, and turns out to be determined by the vanishing of a quantum theta function.

Using this fact we show that in general there can not be multi-flat structures with more than three flat connections.

The resulting NLSE includes a pseudo-stimulated-Raman-scattering (pseudo-SRS) term, which is a spatial-domain counterpart of the SRS term, a well-known ingredient of the temporal-domain NLSE in optics. Analysis of the field-momentum balance and direct simulations demonstrate that wavenumber downshift by the pseudo-SRS may be compensated by the upshift induced by the wind traction, thus maintaining robust bright solitons in both stationary and oscillatory forms; in particular, they are not destroyed by the underlying convective instability.

Using wave turbulence theory, we derive wave kinetic equations that govern the coupled evolution of the spectra of massive and massless waves. We first consider the thermodynamic solutions to these equations and study the wave condensation transition, which is the classical equivalent of Bose-Einstein condensation. We then focus on nonlocal interactions in wavenumber space: we study the decay of an ensemble massive particles into massless ones. Under rather general conditions, these massless particles accumulate at low wavenumber.

1501.05276,nlin,"Droplet solitons are a strongly nonlinear, inherently dynamic structure in the magnetization of ferromagnets, balancing dispersion (exchange energy) with focusing nonlinearity (strong perpendicular anisotropy). Large droplet solitons have the approximate form of a circular domain wall sustained by precession and, in contrast to single magnetic vortices, are predicted to propagate in an extended, homogeneous magnetic medium. In this work, multiscale perturbation theory is utilized to develop an analytical framework for investigating the impact of additional physical effects on the behavior of a propagating droplet. After first developing soliton perturbation theory in the general context of Hamiltonian systems, a number of physical phenomena of current interest are investigated. These include droplet-droplet and droplet-boundary interactions, spatial magnetic field inhomogeneities, spin transfer torque induced forcing in a nanocontact device, and damping. Their combined effects demonstrate the fundamental mechanisms for a previously observed droplet drift instability and under what conditions a slowly propagating droplet can be supported by the nanocontact, important considerations for applications.

Although the hypothetical steady state of vehicles in the deterministic limit corresponds to a unique relationship between speeds and gaps in the proposed model, the traffic states of vehicles dynamically span a two-dimensional region in the plane of speed versus gap, due to the various randomizations. It is shown that the model is able to well reproduce (i) the free flow, synchronized flow, jam as well as the transitions among the three phases; (ii) the evolution features of disturbances and the spatiotemporal patterns in a car-following platoon; (iii) the empirical time series of traffic speed obtained from NGSIM data.

1510.05640,nlin,"Extreme events represent a challenge to natural as well as man-made systems. For critical infrastructure like power grids, we need to understand their resilience against large disturbances. Recently, new measures of the resilience of dynamical systems have been developed in the complex system literature. Basin stability and survivability respectively assess the asymptotic and transient behavior of a system when subjected to arbitrary, localized but large perturbations. To employ these methods to assess the resilience of power grids, we need to choose a model of the power grid. So far the most popular model that has been studied is the classical swing equation model for the frequency response of generators and motors. In this paper we study a more sophisticated model of synchronous machines that also takes voltage dynamics into account, and compare it to the previously studied model. This model has been found to give an accurate picture of the long term evolution of synchronous machines in the engineering literature for post fault studies. We find evidence that some stable fix points of the swing equation become unstable when we add voltage dynamics. If this occurs the asymptotic behavior of the system can be dramatically altered, and basin stability estimates obtained with the swing equation can be dramatically wrong. We also find that the survivability does not change significantly when taking the voltage dynamics into account. Further, the limit cycle type asymptotic behaviour is strongly correlated with transient voltages that violate typical operational voltage bounds. Thus, transient voltage bounds are dominated by transient frequency bounds and play no large role for realistic parameters.",15,[],9

In this paper, the dynamics of glacial-interglacial cycles are investigated using a phase oscillator model forced by the time-varying incoming solar radiation (insolation). We analyze the bifurcations of the system and show that strange nonchaotic attractors appear through nonsmooth saddle-node bifurcations of tori.

1506.06653,nlin,"The density classification problem is one of the simplest yet non-trivial computing tasks which seem to be ideally suitable for cellular automata (CA). Unfortunately, there exists no one-dimensional two-state CA which classifies binary strings according to their densities.

This two-rule solution cannot be easily generalized to two (or higher) dimensions, because it critically depends on a kinetic phase transition occurring in the rule 184. No rule exhibiting analogous transition is known in two dimensions, most likely because no such rule exists.

In this paper I take a phenomenological approach, identifying several factors that discriminate well between systems that would be consensually agreed to be simple versus others that would be consensually agreed to be complex - biological systems and human languages. I argue that a crucial component is that of structural building block hierarchies that, in the case of complex systems, correspond also to a functional hierarchy. I argue that complexity is an emergent property of this structural/functional hierarchy, induced by a property - fitness in the case of biological systems and meaning in the case of languages - that links the elements of this hierarchy across multiple scales. Additionally, I argue that non-complex systems ""are"" while complex systems ""do"" so that the latter, in distinction to physical systems, must be described not only in a space of states but also in a space of update rules (strategies) which we do not know how to specify. Further, the existence of structural/functional building block hierarchies allows for the functional specialisation of structural modules as amply observed in nature.

In spontaneous fission, half-lives are the main observables and quantum tunnelling the essential concept, while in induced fission the focus is on fragment properties and explicitly time-dependent approaches are needed. The cornerstone of the current microscopic theory of fission is the energy density functional formalism. Its basic tenets, including tools such as the HFB theory, effective two-body effective nuclear potentials, finite-temperature extensions and beyond mean-field corrections, are presented succinctly. The EDF approach is often combined with the hypothesis that the time-scale of the large amplitude collective motion driving the system to fission is slow compared to typical time-scales of nucleons inside the nucleus. In practice, this hypothesis of adiabaticity is implemented by introducing (a few) collective variables and mapping out the many-body Schrodinger equation into a collective Schrodinger-like equation for the nuclear wave-packet. Scission configurations indicate where the split occurs. This collective Schrodinger equation depends on an inertia tensor that includes the response of the system to small changes in the collective variables and also plays a special role in the determination of spontaneous fission half-lives. A trademark of the microscopic theory of fission is the tremendous amount of computing needed for practical applications. In particular, the successful implementation of the theories presented in this article requires a very precise numerical resolution of the HFB equations for large values of the collective variables.

As a consequence, local modifications of the overall electron capture rate up to 30\% can be expected, with integrated values strongly dependent on the stiffness of magicity quenching and progenitor mass and potential important consequences on the entropy generation, the neutrino emissivity, and the mass of the core at bounce. Our work underlines the importance of new experimental measurements in this region of the nuclear chart, the most crucial information being the nuclear mass and the Gamow-Teller strength. Reliable microscopic calculations of the associated elementary rate, in a wide range of temperatures and electron densities, optimized on these new empirical information, will be additionally needed to get quantitative predictions of the collapse dynamics.",15,[],11

1506.01447,nucl-th,"We calculate the symmetry energy in cold dense matter both in the normal quark phase and in the 2-color superconductor (2SC) phase. For the normal phase, the thermodynamic potential is calculated by using hard dense loop (HDL) resummation to leading order, where the dominant contribution comes from the longitudinal gluon rest mass. The effect of gluonic interaction to the symmetry energy, obtained from the thermodynamic potential, was found to be small. In the 2SC phase, the non-perturbative BCS paring gives enhanced symmetry energy as the gapped states are forced to be in the common Fermi sea reducing the number of available quarks that can contribute to the asymmetry. We used high density effective field theory to estimate the contribution of gluon interaction to the symmetry energy. Among the gluon rest masses in 2SC phase, only the Meissner mass has iso-spin dependence although the magnitude is much smaller than the Debye mass. As the iso-spin dependence of gluon rest masses is even smaller than the case in the normal phase, we expect that the contribution of gluonic interaction to the symmetry energy in the 2SC phase will be minimal. The different value of symmetry energy in each phase will lead to different prediction for the particle yields in heavy ion collision experiment.",15,['hep-ph'],11

1511.09184,nucl-th,The structure of few-fermion systems having equation spin-isospin symmetry is studied using potential models. The strength and range of the two-body potentials are fixed to describe low energy observables in the angular momentum equation state and spin equation channels of the two-body system. Successively the strength of the potentials are varied in order to explore energy regions in which the two-body scattering lengths are close to the unitary limit. This study is motivated by the fact that in the nuclear system the singlet and triplet scattering lengths are both large with respect to the range of the interaction. Accordingly we expect evidence of universal behavior in the three- and four-nucleon systems that can be observed from the study of correlations between observables. In particular we concentrate in the behavior of the first excited state of the three-nucleon system as the system moves away from the unitary limit.

1504.04924,nucl-th,"We present a detailed formalism of the microscopic particle-rotor model for hypernuclear low-lying states based on a covariant density functional theory. In this method, the hypernuclear states are constructed by coupling a hyperon to low-lying states of the core nucleus, which are described by the generator coordinate method (GCM) with the particle number and angular momentum projections. We apply this method to study in detail the low-lying spectrum of equationC and equationNe hypernuclei. We also briefly discuss the structure of equationSm as an example of heavy deformed hypernuclei. It is shown that the low-lying excitation spectrum with positive parity states of the hypernuclei, which are dominated by equation hyperon in equation-orbital coupled to the core states, are similar to that for the corresponding core states, while the electric quadrupole transition strength, equation, from the 2equation state to the ground state is reduced according to the mass number of the hypernuclei. Our study indicates that the energy splitting between the first 1/2equation and 3/2equation hypernuclear states is generally small for all the hypernuclei which we study. However, their configurations depend much on the properties of a core nucleus, in particular on the sign of deformation parameter. That is, the first equation and equation states in equationC are dominated by a single configuration with equation particle in the equation-wave orbits and thus providing good candidates for a study of the equation spin-orbit splitting. On the other hand, those states in the other hypernuclei exhibit a large configuration mixing and thus their energy difference cannot be interpreted as the spin-orbit splitting for the equation-orbits.",15,['nucl-ex'],11

Here, we go beyond this approximation and include mesonic fluctuations by means of the functional renormalization group. While these fluctuations do not lead to major qualitative changes in the phase diagram of the model, beyond mean-field, one is no-longer free to adjust the parameters so as to reproduce the binding energy per nucleon, the nuclear saturation density, and the nucleon sigma term all at the same time.

In the standard non-relativistic reduction of the single-particle Dirac equation, we derive a universal rule for the relative magnitude of the spin-orbit effect that applies to very different quantum systems, regardless of whether the spin-orbit coupling originates from the strong or electromagnetic interaction. It is shown that in nuclei the near equality of the mass of the nucleon and the difference between the large repulsive and attractive potentials explains the fact that spin-orbit splittings are comparable to the energy spacing between major shells.

1508.04861,nucl-th,"Bulk properties of cold and hot neutron stars (NSs) are studied on the basis of the hadron-quark crossover picture where a smooth transition from the hadronic phase to the quark phase takes place at finite baryon density. By using a phenomenological equation of state (EOS) ""CRover"" which interpolates the two phases at around 3 times the nuclear matter density, it is found that the cold NSs with the gravitational mass larger than 2-solarmass can be sustained. This is in sharp contrast to the case of the first-order hadron-quark transition. The radii of the cold NSs with the CRover EOS are in the narrow range which is insensitive to the NS masses. Due to the stiffening of the EOS induced by the hadron-quark crossover, the central density of the NSs is at most 4 times the nuclear matter density and the hyperon-mixing barely occurs inside the NS core. This constitutes a solution of the long-standing hyperon puzzle. The effect of color superconductivity (CSC) on the NS structures is also examined with the hadron-quark crossover. For the typical strength of the diquark attraction, a slight softening of the EOS due to two-flavor CSC (2SC) takes place and the maximum mass is reduced by about 0.2-solarmass.   The CRover EOS is generalized to the supernova matter at finite temperature to describe the hot NSs at birth.

At equation keV, third generation synchrotron radiation sources produce a maximum of equation photons per second in a meV bandwidth. In this work we discuss about the possibility of increasing this flux a thousand-fold by exploiting high repetition rate self-seeded pulses at the European XFEL. Here we report on a feasibility study for an optimized configuration of the SASE2 beamline at the European XFEL which combines self-seeding and undulator tapering techniques in order to increase the average spectral flux at equation keV. In particular, we propose to perform monochromatization at equation keV with the help of self-seeding, and amplify the seed in the first part of output undulator. The amplification process can be stopped at a position well before saturation, where the electron beam gets considerable bunching at the 2nd harmonic of the coherent radiation. A second part of the output undulator follows, tuned to the 2nd harmonic frequency, i.e. at equation keV and is used to obtain saturation at this energy. One can further prolong the exchange of energy between the photon and the electron beam by tapering the last part of the output undulator. We performed start-to-end simulations and demonstrate that self-seeding, combined with undulator tapering, allows one to achieve more than a hundred-fold increase in average spectral flux compared with the nominal SASE regime at saturation, resulting in a maximum flux of order equation photons per second in a meV bandwidth.",15,[],5

In this implementation, rather than scanning wedges to vary the dispersion as in standard d-scan, the pulse to be measured experiences a spatially varying amount of dispersion in a Littrow prism. The resulting beam is then imaged into a second-harmonic generation crystal and an imaging spectrometer is used to measure the two-dimensional trace, which is analyzed using the d-scan retrieval algorithm. We compare the single-shot implementation with the standard d-scan for the measurement of sub-3.5-fs pulses from a hollow core fiber pulse compressor. We show that the retrieval algorithm used to extract amplitude and phase of the pulse provides comparable results, proving the validity of the new single-shot implementation down to near single-cycle durations.",15,[],5
1507.03950,physics,We report resonant features of novel controllable reflectarray which consists of meander-like graphene strips placed on a metal-backed dielectric substrate. The structure manifests two kinds of resonances appeared as sharp deeps of reflectivity. The first one exists because the strips of periodic cells of the structure have resonant sizes for induced surface plasmon-polaritons. The second kind of resonances is defined by excitation of TM eigenwaves of the whole structure as a plane photonic crystal. The latter resonances do not depend on whether the strips of the unit cells have resonant sizes or not.,15,['cond-mat'],5
1503.06769,physics,"The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is widely used to sample a probability density function (pdf) generated by a stochastic model conditioned by noisy data. This pdf can be either a joint posterior that describes the evolution of the state of the system in time, conditioned on all the data up to the present, or a particular marginal of this posterior. We show that the EnKF collapses in the same way and under even broader conditions as a particle filter when it samples the joint posterior. However, this does not imply that EnKF collapses when it samples the marginal posterior. We we show that a localized and inflated EnKF can efficiently sample this marginal, and argue that the marginal posterior is often the more useful pdf in geophysics. This explains the wide applicability of EnKF in this field. We further investigate the typical tuning of EnKF, in which one attempts to match the mean square error (MSE) to the marginal posterior variance, and show that sampling error may be huge, even if the MSE is moderate.",15,['stat'],5

1509.04605,physics,"Schooling, an archetype of collective behavior, emerges from the interactions of fish responding to visual and other informative cues mediated by their aqueous environment. In this context, a fundamental and largely unexplored question concerns the role of hydrodynamics. Here, we investigate schooling by modeling swimmers as vortex dipoles whose interactions are governed by the Biot-Savart law. When we enhance these dipoles with behavioral rules from classical agent based models we find that they do not lead robustly to schooling due to flow mediated interactions. In turn, we present dipole swimmers equipped with adaptive decision-making that learn, through a reinforcement learning algorithm, to adjust their gaits in response to non-linearly varying hydrodynamic loads. The dipoles maintain their relative position within a formation by adapting their strength and school in a variety of prescribed geometrical arrangements. Furthermore, we identify schooling patterns that minimize the individual and the collective swimming effort, through an evolutionary optimization. The present work suggests that the adaptive response of individual swimmers to flow-mediated interactions is critical in fish schooling.",15,[],5

Currently, the results on the joint degree distribution of growing multiplex networks present in the literature pertain to the case of two layers, and are confined to the special case of homogeneous growth, and are limited to the state state (that is, the limit of infinite size). In the present paper, we obtain closed-form solutions for the joint degree distribution of heterogeneously growing multiplex networks with arbitrary number of layers in the steady state. Heterogeneous growth means that each incoming node establishes different numbers of links in different layers. We consider both uniform and preferential growth. We then extend the analysis of the uniform growth mechanism to arbitrary times. We obtain a closed-form solution for the time-dependent joint degree distribution of a growing multiplex network with arbitrary initial conditions. Throughout, theoretical findings are corroborated with Monte Carlo simulations. The results shed light on the effects of the initial network on the transient dynamics of growing multiplex networks, and takes a step towards characterizing the temporal variations of the connectivity of growing multiplex networks, as well as predicting their future structural properties.",15,"['cond-mat', 'cs']",5

1506.07548,physics,"Table-top laser-plasma ion accelerators seldom achieve narrow energy spreads, and never without serious compromises in efficiency, particle yield, etc. Using massive computer simulations, we identify a self-organizing scheme that exploits persisting self-generated plasma electric (~TV/m) and magnetic (~10equation Tesla) fields to reduce the ion energy spread after the laser exits the plasma - separating the ion acceleration from the energy spread reduction. Consistent with the scheme, we experimentally demonstrate aluminum and carbon ion beams with narrow spectral peaks at energies up to 310 MeV (11.5 MeV/nucleon) and 220 MeV (18.3 MeV/nucleon), respectively, with high conversion efficiency (~5%, i.e., 4J out of 80J laser). This is achieved with 0.12 PW high-contrast Gaussian laser pulses irradiating planar foils with optimal thicknesses of up to 250 nm that scale with laser intensity. When increasing the focused laser intensity fourfold (by reducing the focusing optic f/number twofold), the spectral-peak energy increases twofold.

1502.01760,physics,"In this work, the performance of Tunnel Field-Effect Transistors (TFETs) based on two-dimensional Transition Metal Dichalcogenide (TMD) materials is investigated by atomistic quantum transport simulations. One of the major challenges of TFETs is their low ON-currents. 2D material based TFETs can have tight gate control and high electric fields at the tunnel junction, and can in principle generate high ON-currents along with a sub-threshold swing smaller than 60 mV/dec. Our simulations reveal that high performance TMD TFETs, not only require good gate control, but also rely on the choice of the right channel material with optimum band gap, effective mass and source/drain doping level. Unlike previous works, a full band atomistic tight binding method is used self-consistently with 3D Poisson equation to simulate ballistic quantum transport in these devices. The effect of the choice of TMD material on the performance of the device and its transfer characteristics are discussed.

1502.07728,physics,"In this paper the normal collision of spherical particles is investigated. The particle interaction is modelled in a macroscopic way using the Hertzian contact force with additional linear damping. The goal of the work is to develop an efficient approximate solution of sufficient accuracy for this problem which can be used in soft-sphere collision models for Discrete Element Methods and for particle transport in viscous fluids. First, by the choice of appropriate units, the number of governing parameters of the collision process is reduced to one, which is a simple combination of known material parameters as well as initial conditions. It provides a dimensionless parameter that characterizes all such collisions up to dynamic similitude. Next, a rigorous calculation of the collision time and restitution coefficient from the governing equations, in the form of a series expansion in this parameter is provided. Such a calculation based on first principles is particularly interesting from a theoretical perspective. Since the governing equations present some technical difficulties, the methods employed are also of interest from the point of view of the analytical technique. Using further approximations, compact expressions for the restitution coefficient and the collision time are then provided. These are used to implement an approximate algebraic rule for computing the desired stiffness and damping in the framework of the adaptive collision model (Kempe & Frohlich, J.

In this work, we focus on hyperfine states of selected hydrogenic muonic isotopes, and on how quantum interference affects the measured Lamb shift. The process of photon excitation and subsequent photon decay is implemented within the framework of nonrelativistic second-order perturbation theory. Due to its experimental interest, calculations are performed for muonic hydrogen, deuterium, and helium-3. We restrict our analysis to the case of photon scattering by incident linear polarized photons and the polarization of the scattered photons not being observed. We conclude that while quantum interference effects can be safely neglected in muonic hydrogen and helium-3, in the case of muonic deuterium there are resonances with close proximity, where quantum interference effects can induce shifts up to a few percent of the linewidth, assuming a pointlike detector. However, by taking into account the geometry of the setup used by the CREMA collaboration, this effect is reduced to less than 0.2% of the linewidth in all possible cases, which makes it irrelevant at the present level of accuracy.",15,[],5

GPEC allows to compute equilibrium flux distributions sufficiently accurate to derive parameters for plasma control within 1 ms of runtime which enables real-time applications at the ASDEX Upgrade experiment (AUG) and other machines with a control cycle of at least this size. The underlying algorithms are based on the well-established offline-analysis code CLISTE, following the classical concept of iteratively solving the Grad-Shafranov equation and feeding in diagnostic signals from the experiment. The new code adopts a hybrid parallelization scheme for computing the equilibrium flux distribution and extends the fast, shared-memory-parallel Poisson solver which we have described previously by a distributed computation of the individual Poisson problems corresponding to different basis functions. The code is based entirely on open-source software components and runs on standard server hardware and software environments. The real-time capability of GPEC is demonstrated by performing an offline-computation of a sequence of 1000 flux distributions which are taken from one second of operation of a typical AUG discharge and deriving the relevant control parameters with a time resolution of a millisecond. On current server hardware the new code allows employing a grid size of 32x64 zones for the spatial discretization and up to 15 basis functions.

This field, which has been a longstanding concern of sociologists and psychologists, has been extended into an area of experimental social psychology, and even has attracted the attention of physicists and mathematicians. In this article, we present a novel model of opinion formation in which agents may either have a strict preference for a choice, or be undecided. The opinion shift emerges during interpersonal communications, as a consequence of a cumulative process of conviction for one of the two extremes opinions through repeated interactions. There are two main ingredients which play key roles in determining the steady state: the initial fraction of undecided agents and the conviction's sensitivity in each interaction. As a function of these two parameters, the model presents a wide range of possible solutions, as for instance, consensus of each opinion, bi-polarisation or convergence of undecided individuals. We found that a minimum fraction of undecided agents is crucial not only for reaching consensus of a given opinion, but also to determine a dominant opinion in a polarised situation.

Here, we propose a quantitative approach to this problem, we use it to design an empirically testable CBA model, and we apply it to the the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the highest-energy accelerator in the world, currently operating at CERN.

Four classes of contributions to users are identified: knowledge output, human capital development, technological spillovers, and cultural effects. Benefits for non-users can be estimated, in analogy to public goods with no practical use (such as environment preservation), using willingness to pay. We determine the probability distribution of cost and benefits for the LHC since 1993 until planned decommissioning in 2025, and we find there is a 92% probability that benefits exceed its costs, with an expected net present value of about 3 billion euro, not including the unpredictable economic value of discovery of any new physics.

1512.06286,physics,"In this paper an approach for decreasing the computational effort required for the spectral simulations of the water waves is introduced. Signals with majority of the components zero, are known as the sparse signals. Like majority of the signals in the nature it can be realized that water waves are sparse either in time or in the frequency domain. Using the sparsity property of the water waves in the time or in the frequency domain, the compressive sampling algorithm can be used as a tool for improving the performance of the spectral simulation of the water waves. The methodology offered in this paper depends on the idea of using a smaller number of spectral components compared to the classical spectral method with a high number of components. After performing the time integration with a smaller number of spectral components and using the compressive sampling technique, it is shown that the water wave field can be reconstructed with a significantly better efficiency compared to the classical spectral method with a high number of spectral components, especially for long time evolutions.   For the sparse water wave model in the time domain the well-known solitary wave solutions of the Korteweg-deVries (KdV) equation is considered. For the sparse water wave model in the frequency domain the well-known Airy (linear) ocean waves with Jonswap spectrum is considered. Utilizing a spectral method, it is shown that by using a smaller number of spectral components compared to the classical spectral method with a high number of components, it is possible to simulate the sparse water waves with negligible error in accuracy and a great efficiency especially for large time evolutions.",15,"['math-ph', 'math']",5

However, the speed of light pulses can be altered significantly in dispersive materials. While significant control can be exerted over the speed of light in such media, no experimental demonstration of altered light speeds has hitherto been achieved in vacuum for 'twisted' optical beams. We show that 'twisted' light pulses exhibit subluminal velocities in vacuum, being slowed by 0.1\% relative to c. This work does not challenge relativity theory, but experimentally supports a body of theoretical work on the counterintuitive vacuum group velocities of twisted pulses. These results are particularly important given recent interest in applications of twisted light to quantum information, communication and quantum key distribution.",15,['quant-ph'],5

We study the finite-time onset of spontaneous stochasticity in a real version of the GOY shell model of turbulence. This model allows high-accuracy numerical simulations for a wide range of scales (up to ten orders of magnitude) and demonstrates non-chaotic dynamics, but leads to an infinite number of solutions in the vanishing viscosity limit after the blowup time. Thus, the spontaneous stochasticity phenomenon is clearly distinguished from the chaotic behavior in turbulent flows. We provide the numerical and theoretical description of the system dynamics at all stages. This includes the asymptotic analysis before and after the blowup leading to universal (periodic and quasi-periodic) renormalized solutions, followed by nonunique stationary states at large times.",15,"['math-ph', 'math']",5
1507.05108,physics,"One of the most widely used methods for community detection in networks is the maximization of the quality function known as modularity. Of the many maximization techniques that have been used in this context, some of the most conceptually attractive are the spectral methods, which are based on the eigenvectors of the modularity matrix. Spectral algorithms have, however, been limited by and large to the division of networks into only two or three communities, with divisions into more than three being achieved by repeated two-way division. Here we present a spectral algorithm that can directly divide a network into any number of communities. The algorithm makes use of a mapping from modularity maximization to a vector partitioning problem, combined with a fast heuristic for vector partitioning. We compare the performance of this spectral algorithm with previous approaches and find it to give superior results, particularly in cases where community sizes are unbalanced. We also give demonstrative applications of the algorithm to two real-world networks and find that it produces results in good agreement with expectations for the networks studied.",15,"['cond-mat', 'cs']",5

By combining our recommended theoretical results with the corresponding experimental values, improved nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments of the above isotopes are determined. In the present work, it is observed that there are large discrepancies between the hyperfine structure constants of the equation state obtained from the experimental and theoretical studies whereas good agreements are found for the other equation states.

Except for a constant shift, the calculated spectrum of 2-thiouracil agrees very well with experiment, while no experimental spectra are available for the two other compounds. For all three molecules, the photoelectron spectra show distinct bands due to ionization of the sulphur and oxygen lone pairs and the pyrimidine equation system. The excited-state photoelectron spectra of 2-thiouracil show bands at much lower energies than in the ground state spectrum, allowing to monitor the excited-state population in time-resolved UV photoelectron spectroscopy (TRPES) experiments. However, the results also reveal that single-photon ionization probe schemes alone will not allow monitoring all photodynamic processes existing in 2-thiouracil.

In particular, light amplification in randomly dispersed active inclusions under external pumping has been extensively investigated, although it still lacks external tunability, reproducibility, and control over the beam spatial pattern, thus hindering its application in practical devices. Here we show that a graphene random metamaterial provides the means to overcome these limitations through its extraordinarily-low threshold for saturable absorption.

The GE1/1 CMS project consists of 144 GEM chambers of about 0.5 m2 active area each, employing three GEM foils per chamber, to be installed in the forward region of the CMS endcap during the long shutdown of LHC in 2108-2019. The large active area of each GE1/1 chamber consists of GEM foils that are mechanically stretched in order to secure their flatness and the consequent uniform performance of the GE1/1 chamber across its whole active surface. So far FBGs have been used in high energy physics mainly as high precision positioning and re-positioning sensors and as low cost, easy to mount, low space consuming temperature sensors. FBGs are also commonly used for very precise strain measurements in material studies. In this work we present a novel use of FBGs as flatness and mechanical tensioning sensors applied to the wide GEM foils of the GE1/1 chambers.

1511.02168,physics,"Notable recent works have focused on the multi-layer properties of coevolving diseases. We point out that very similar systems play an important role in population ecology. Specifically we study a meta food-web model that was recently proposed by Pillai et al. This model describes a network of species connected by feeding interactions, which spread over a network of spatial patches. Focusing on the essential case, where the network of feeding interactions is a chain, we develop an analytical approach for the computation of the degree distributions of colonized spatial patches for the different species in the chain. This framework allows us to address ecologically relevant questions. Considering configuration model ensembles of spatial networks, we find that there is an upper bound for the fraction of patches that a given species can occupy, which depends only on the networks mean degree. For a given mean degree there is then an optimal degree distribution that comes closest to the upper bound. Notably scale-free degree distributions perform worse than more homogeneous degree distributions if the mean degree is sufficiently high. Because species experience the underlying network differently the optimal degree distribution for one particular species is generally not the optimal distribution for the other species in the same food web. These results are of interest for conservation ecology, where, for instance, the task of selecting areas of old-growth forest to preserve in an agricultural landscape, amounts to the design of a patch network.",15,"['nlin', 'q-bio']",5

The performance of the filters is demonstrated with a 762 g Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detector, produced by Canberra, that measures letter-ray lines from radioactive sources in an energy range between 59.5 and 2614.5 keV. At 1332.5 keV, together with the ballistic deficit correction method, all filters produce a comparable energy resolution of ~1.61 keV FWHM. This value is superior to those measured by the manufacturer and those found in publications with detectors of a similar design and mass. At 59.5 keV, the modified cusp filter without a ballistic deficit correction produced the best result, with an energy resolution of 0.46 keV. It is observed that the loss in resolution by using a constant shaping time over the entire energy range is small when using the ballistic deficit correction method.",15,[],5

1511.07262,physics,"In this work we develop an approach for a molecular hydrogen ion (H2) in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation while exposed to intense short-pulse radiation. Our starting point is the R-Matrix incorporating Time (RMT) formulation for atomic hydrogen [L. A. A. Nikolopoulos et al, Phys. Rev. A 78, 063420 (2008)] which has proven to be successful at treating multi-electron atomic systems efficiently and to high accuracy [L. R. Moore et al J. Mod. Opt. 58,1132, (2011)]. The present study on H2 has been performed with a similar objective of developing an ab initio method for solving the Time-dependent Schrodinger Equation (TDSE) for multi-electron diatomic molecules exposed to an external time-dependent potential field. The theoretical formulation is developed in detail for the molecular hydrogen ion where all the multi-electron and inter-nuclei complications are absent. As in the atomic case, the configuration space of the electron's coordinates are separated artificially over two regions; the inner (I) and outer (II) regions. In the region I the time-dependent wavefunction is expanded on the eigenstate basis corresponding to the molecule's Hamiltonian augmented by Bloch operators, while in region II a grid representation is used. We demonstrate the independence of our results on the introduced artificial boundary-surface by calculating observables that are directly accessed experimentally and also by showing gauge-dependent quantities are also invariant with the region I box size.

1508.02045,physics,"In this paper, we assess the performance of four iterative algorithms for solving non-symmetric rank-deficient linear systems arising in the FFT-based homogenization of heterogeneous materials defined by digital images. Our framework is based on the Fourier-Galerkin method with exact and approximate integrations that has recently been shown to generalize the Lippmann-Schwinger setting of the original work by Moulinec and Suquet from 1994. It follows from this variational format that the ensuing system of linear equations can be solved by general-purpose iterative algorithms for symmetric positive-definite systems, such as the Richardson, the Conjugate gradient, and the Chebyshev algorithms, that are compared here to the Eyre-Milton scheme - the most efficient specialized method currently available. Our numerical experiments, carried out for two-dimensional elliptic problems, reveal that the Conjugate gradient algorithm is the most efficient option, while the Eyre-Milton method performs comparably to the Chebyshev semi-iteration. The Richardson algorithm, equivalent to the still widely used original Moulinec-Suquet solver, exhibits the slowest convergence. Besides this, we hope that our study highlights the potential of the well-established techniques of numerical linear algebra to further increase the efficiency of FFT-based homogenization methods.",15,"['cond-mat', 'math']",5
1507.02148,q-bio,"The assembly of virus capsids from free coat proteins proceeds by a complicated cascade of association and dissociation steps, the great majority of which cannot be directly experimentally observed. This has made capsid assembly a rich field for computational models to attempt to fill the gaps in what is experimentally observable. Nonetheless, accurate simulation predictions depend on accurate models and there are substantial obstacles to model inference for such systems. Here, we describe progress in learning parameters for capsid assembly systems, particularly kinetic rate constants of coat-coat interactions, by computationally fitting simulations to experimental data. We previously developed an approach to learn rate parameters of coat-coat interactions by minimizing the deviation between real and simulated light scattering data monitoring bulk capsid assembly in vitro. This is a difficult data-fitting problem, however, because of the high computational cost of simulating assembly trajectories, the stochastic noise inherent to the models, and the limited and noisy data available for fitting. Here we show that a newer classes of methods, based on derivative-free optimization (DFO), can more quickly and precisely learn physical parameters from static light scattering data. We further explore how the advantages of the approaches might be affected by alternative data sources through simulation of a model of time-resolved mass spectrometry data, an alternative technology for monitoring bulk capsid assembly that can be expected to provide much richer data. The results show that advances in both the data and the algorithms can improve model inference, with rich data leading to high-quality fits for all methods, but DFO methods showing substantial advantages over less informative data sources better representative of the current experimental practice.",15,['physics'],10

A DNA dodecamer d(CGCGAATTCGCG) in water solution with the alkali metal counterions Naequation, Kequation, and Csequation has been simulated. The systems have been considered in the regimes without excess salt and with different salts (0.5 M of NaCl, KCl or CsCl) added. The results have showed that the Naequation counterions interact with the phosphate groups directly from outside of the double helix and via water molecules at the top edge of DNA minor groove. The potassium ions are mostly localized in the grooves of the double helix, and the cesium ions penetrate deeply inside the minor groove being bonded directly to the atoms of nucleic bases. Due to the electrostatic repulsion the chlorine ions tend to be localized at large distances from the DNA polyanion, but some Clequation anions have been detected near atomic groups of the double helix forming electrically neutral pairs with counterions already condensed on DNA. The DNA sites, where counterions are incorporated, are characterized by local changes of double helix structure. The lifetime of Naequation and Kequation in complex with DNA atomic groups is less than 0.5 ns, while in the case of the cesium ions it may reach several nanoseconds.

The calculated radius of gyration, showing dramatic variations with pH, is in excellent agreement with scattering experiments. At equation Ub folds in a two-state manner at low and neutral pH. Clustering analysis of the conformations sampled in equilibrium folding trajectories at equation, with multiple transitions between the folded and unfolded states, show a network of metastable states connecting the native and unfolded states. At low and neutral pH, Ub folds with high probability through a preferred set of conformations resulting in a pH-dependent dominant folding pathway. Folding kinetics reveal that Ub assembly at low pH occurs by multiple pathways involving a combination of nucleation-collapse and diffusion collision mechanism. The mechanism by which Ub folds is dictated by the stability of the key secondary structural elements responsible for establishing long range contacts and collapse of Ub. Nucleation collapse mechanism holds if the stability of these elements are marginal, as would be the case at elevated temperatures. If the lifetimes associated with these structured microdomains are on the order of hundreds of equation then Ub folding follows the diffusion-collision mechanism with intermediates many of which coincide with those found in equilibrium. Folding at neutral pH is a sequential process with a populated intermediate resembling that sampled at equilibrium. The transition state structures, obtained using a equation analysis, are homogeneous and globular with most of the secondary and tertiary structures being native-like.

1508.05468,q-bio,"Many central neurons, and in particular certain brainstem aminergic neurons exhibit spontaneous and fairly regular spiking with frequencies of order a few Hz. A large number of ion channel types contribute to such spiking so that accurate modeling of spike generation leads to the requirement of solving very large systems of differential equations, ordinary in the first instance. Since analysis of spiking behavior when many synaptic inputs are active adds further to the number of components, it is useful to have simplified mathematical models of spiking in such neurons so that, for example, stochastic features of inputs and output spike trains can be incorporated. In this article we investigate two simple two-component models which mimic features of spiking in serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus and noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus. The first model is of the Fitzhugh-Nagumo type and the second is a reduced Hodgkin-Huxley model. For each model solutions are computed with two representative sets of parameters. Frequency versus input currents are found and reveal Hodgkin type 2 behavior. For the first model a bifurcation and phase plane analysis supports these findings. The spike trajectories in the second model are very similar to those in DRN SE pacemaker activity but there are more parameters than in the Fitzhugh-Nagumo type model.

Recently Navratilova et al(2) suggested that our findings reflected poor isolation of the spikes from multiple grid cells, rather than the existence of actual non-grid SPCs. Here we refute this suggestion by showing that: (i) most SPCs cannot be formed from hexagonal grids; (ii) all standard cluster isolation measures are similar between recorded grid cells and non-grid SPCs, and are comparable to those reported in other laboratories; (iii) the spikes from different fields of band-like SPCs do not differ.

1506.08511,q-bio,"The linking genotype to phenotype is the fundamental aim of modern genetics. We focus on study of links between gene expression data and phenotype data through integrative analysis. We propose three approaches.   1) The inherent complexity of phenotypes makes high-throughput phenotype profiling a very difficult and laborious process. We propose a method of automated multi-dimensional profiling which uses gene expression similarity. Large-scale analysis show that our method can provide robust profiling that reveals different phenotypic aspects of samples. This profiling technique is also capable of interpolation and extrapolation beyond the phenotype information given in training data. It can be used in many applications, including facilitating experimental design and detecting confounding factors.   2) Phenotype association analysis problems are complicated by small sample size and high dimensionality. Consequently, phenotype-associated gene subsets obtained from training data are very sensitive to selection of training samples, and the constructed sample phenotype classifiers tend to have poor generalization properties. To eliminate these obstacles, we propose a novel approach that generates sequences of increasingly discriminative gene cluster combinations. Our experiments on both simulated and real datasets show robust and accurate classification performance.   3) Many complex phenotypes, such as cancer, are the product of not only gene expression, but also gene interaction. We propose an integrative approach to find gene network modules that activate under different phenotype conditions.

1508.01916,q-bio,"Land cover has been evaluated and classified on the basis of general features using reflectance or digital levels of photographic or satellite data. One of the most common methodologies based on CORINE land cover (Coordination of Information on the Environment) data, which classifies natural cover according to a small number of categories. This method produces generalizations about the inventoried areas, resulting in the loss of important floristic and structural information about vegetation types present (such as palm groves, tall dense mangroves, and dense forests). This classification forfeits relevant information on sites with high heterogeneity and diversity. Especially in the tropics, simplification of coverage types reaches its maximum level with the use of deforestation analysis, particularly when it is reduced to the two classes of forests and nonforests. As this paper demonstrates, these results have considerable consequences for political efforts to conserve the biodiversity of megadiverse countries. We designed a new methodological approach that incorporates biological distinctiveness combined with phytosociological classification of vegetation and its relation to physical features. This approach is based on parameters obtained through canonical correspondence analysis on a fuzzy logic model, which are used to construct multiple coverage maps. This tool is useful for monitoring and analyzing vegetation dynamics, since it maintains the typological integrity of a cartographic series. The methodology creates cartographic series congruent in time and scale, can be applied to multiple and varied satellite inputs, and always evaluates the same model parameters.

1505.01215,q-bio,"We examine the binding of transcription factors to DNA in terms of an information transfer problem. The input of the noisy channel is the biophysical signal of a factor bound to a DNA site, and the output is a distribution of probable DNA sequences at this site. This task involves an inherent tradeoff between the information gain and the energetics of the binding interaction - high binding energies provide higher information gain but hinder the dynamics of the system as factors are bound too tightly. We show that adaptation of the binding interaction towards increasing information transfer under a general energy constraint implies that the information gain per specific binding energy at each base-pair is maximized. We analyze hundreds of prokaryote and eukaryote transcription factors from various organisms to evaluate the discrimination energies. We find that, in accordance with our theoretical argument, binding energies nearly maximize the information gain per energy. This work suggests the adaptation of information gain as a generic design principle of molecular recognition systems.",15,['physics'],10

1502.03011,q-bio,"Transcriptional repression may cause transcriptional noise by a competition between repressor and RNA polymerase binding. Although promoter activity is often governed by a single limiting step, we argue here that the size of the noise strongly depends on whether this step is the initial equilibrium binding or one of the subsequent unidirectional steps. Overall, we show that nonequilibrium steps of transcription initiation systematically increase the cell-to-cell heterogeneity in bacterial populations. In particular, this allows also weak promoters to give substantial transcriptional noise.",15,[],10
1505.02888,q-bio,"Neutral dynamics, where taxa are assumed to be demographically equivalent and their abundance is governed solely by the stochasticity of the underlying birth-death process, has proved itself as an important minimal model that accounts for many empirical datasets in genetics and ecology. However, the restriction of the model to demographic [equation] noise yields relatively slow dynamics that appears to be in conflict with both short-term and long-term characteristics of the observed systems. Here we analyze two of these problems - age size relationships and species extinction time - in the framework of a neutral theory with both demographic and environmental stochasticity. It turns out that environmentally induced variations of the demographic rates control the long-term dynamics and modify dramatically the predictions of the neutral theory with demographic noise only, yielding much better agreement with empirical data. We consider two prototypes of ""zero mean"" environmental noise, one which is balanced with regard to the arithmetic abundance, another balanced in the logarithmic (fitness) space, study their species lifetime statistics and discuss their relevance to realistic models of community dynamics.",15,[],10
1501.07074,q-bio,"We study how modularity of the human brain changes as children develop into adults. Theory suggests that modularity can enhance the response function of a networked system subject to changing external stimuli. Thus, greater cognitive performance might be achieved for more modular neural activity, and modularity might likely increase as children develop. The value of modularity calculated from fMRI data is observed to increase during childhood development and peak in young adulthood. Head motion is deconvolved from the fMRI data, and it is shown that the dependence of modularity on age is independent of the magnitude of head motion. A model is presented to illustrate how modularity can provide greater cognitive performance at short times, i.e.\ task switching. A fitness function is extracted from the model. Quasispecies theory is used to predict how the average modularity evolves with age, illustrating the increase of modularity during development from children to adults that arises from selection for rapid cognitive function in young adults. Experiments exploring the effect of modularity on cognitive performance are suggested. Modularity may be a potential biomarker for injury, rehabilitation, or disease.",15,[],10
1511.07652,q-bio,"Adhesion processes of biological membranes that enclose cells and cellular organelles are essential for immune responses, tissue formation, and signaling. These processes depend sensitively on the binding constant K2D of the membrane-anchored receptor and ligand proteins that mediate adhesion, which is difficult to measure in the 'two-dimensional' (2D) membrane environment of the proteins. An important problem therefore is to relate K2D to the binding constant K3D of soluble variants of the receptors and ligands that lack the membrane anchors and are free to diffuse in three dimensions (3D). In this article, we present a general theory for the binding constants K2D and K3D of rather stiff proteins whose main degrees of freedom are translation and rotation, along membranes and around anchor points 'in 2D', or unconstrained 'in 3D'. The theory generalizes previous results by describing how K2D depends both on the average separation and thermal nanoscale roughness of the apposing membranes, and on the length and anchoring flexibility of the receptors and ligands. Our theoretical results for the ratio K2D/K3D of the binding constants agree with detailed results from Monte Carlo simulations without any data fitting, which indicates that the theory captures the essential features of the 'dimensionality reduction' due to membrane anchoring. In our Monte Carlo simulations, we consider a novel coarse-grained model of biomembrane adhesion in which the membranes are represented as discretized elastic surfaces, and the receptors and ligands as anchored molecules that diffuse continuously along the membranes and rotate at their anchor points.",15,['physics'],10

McClelland, is an intriguing and well-written book that provides a groundbreaking overview of diverse approaches to understanding memory that sets the agenda for an interdisciplinary approach to the topic. Memory has long been a focus of investigation and interest in both the sciences and the humanities. The way memory enriches and distorts lived experience has been widely explored in literature and the arts. Our fascination with the subject is increasingly evident in popular culture, with the widespread proliferation of novels and movies in which events play out in a nonlinear fashion that reflects how memories of them are woven together in the minds of the characters involved. Scientific approaches to memory have focused on the study of amnesiacs, neuroimaging studies, and cognitive studies of the formation, retrieval, and forgetting of memories. Until now, however, humanistic and scientific investigations of memory have been carried out independently. This book provides an exemplary illustration of how disciplinary boundaries can be transcended, showing how approaches to memory from the humanities and the sciences can revitalize one another. With 19 chapters written by academics from a range of disciplines including neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, cognitive science, cultural studies, philosophy, bioethics, history of science, art, theatre, film, and literature, it is undoubtedly one of the most interdisciplinary books on library shelves. Together these diverse perspectives provide a broad and stimulating overview of the memory process.",15,[],10

The integrated state enables faster and more accurate performance on a cognitive task, and is associated with dilations in pupil diameter, suggesting that ascending neuromodulatory systems may govern the transition between these alternative modes of brain function.

We adopt the similarity matching framework, recently developed for principal subspace extraction, but modify the existing objective functions by adding a decorrelating term. From the modified objective functions, we derive online PCA and whitening algorithms which are implementable by neural networks with local learning rules, i.e. synaptic weight updates that depend on the activity of only pre- and postsynaptic neurons.

1504.06727,q-bio,"The stability of ecosystems as well as the relation between topology and dynamics on multilayer networks are important questions that are usually discussed in separate communities. Here, we combine these two topics by investigating the influence of the topology of the migration network on the stability of a four-species foodweb module on six patches. The parameters are chosen such that the dynamics on an isolated patch have a periodic attractor with all four species present as well as an attractor where the prey that is preferred by the top predator dies out. The stability measure used here is robustness, which is the average proportion of surviving species in the system, and which shows a complex dependence on the migration rate. We use principal component analysis to quantify the migration network structure in terms of the most relevant network measures, and we evaluate correlations between these measures and characteristics of the robustness curves. Our most important findings are that higher connectivity of the migration network leads to a larger maximum robustness, that a broad distribution of connectivities favors extinction of the preferred prey at intermediate migration rates, and that migration topologies with a larger betweenness centrality are more prone to extinction of the preferred prey at the onset of synchronization. Our study thus demonstrates a strong correlation between dynamical robustness and spatial topology and can serve as an example for similar studies in other types of multilayer networks.",15,[],10

We study two types of vaccination strategies: i) optimal vaccination, in the sense that it minimizes the effort of vaccination in the set of vaccination strategies for which, for any sufficiently small perturbation of the disease free state, the number of infectious individuals is monotonically decreasing; ii) Nash-equilibria strategies where all individuals simultaneously minimize the joint risk of vaccination versus the risk of the disease. The former case corresponds to an optimal solution for mandatory vaccinations, while the second correspond to the equilibrium to be expected if vaccination is fully voluntary. We are able to show the existence of both an optimal and Nash strategies in a general setting. In general, these strategies will not be functions but Radon measures. For specific forms of the transmission rate, we provide explicit formulas for the optimal and the Nash vaccination strategies.",15,[],10
1510.07592,q-bio,"Coherent neural spiking and local field potentials are believed to be signatures of the binding and transfer of information in the brain. Coherent activity has now been measured experimentally in many regions of mammalian cortex. Synfire chains are one of the main theoretical constructs that have been appealed to to describe coherent spiking phenomena. However, for some time, it has been known that synchronous activity in feedforward networks asymptotically either approaches an attractor with fixed waveform and amplitude, or fails to propagate. This has limited their ability to explain graded neuronal responses. Recently, we have shown that pulse-gated synfire chains are capable of propagating graded information coded in mean population current or firing rate amplitudes. In particular, we showed that it is possible to use one synfire chain to provide gating pulses and a second, pulse-gated synfire chain to propagate graded information. We called these circuits synfire-gated synfire chains (SGSCs). Here, we present SGSCs in which graded information can rapidly cascade through a neural circuit, and show a correspondence between this type of transfer and a mean-field model in which gating pulses overlap in time. We show that SGSCs are robust in the presence of variability in population size, pulse timing and synaptic strength. Finally, we demonstrate the computational capabilities of SGSC-based information coding by implementing a self-contained, spike-based, modular neural circuit that is triggered by, then reads in streaming input, processes the input, then makes a decision based on the processed information and shuts itself down.",15,[],10

1502.06025,q-bio,"The delineation of logical definitions for each class in an ontology and the consistent application of these definitions to the assignment of instances to classes are important criteria for ontology evaluation. If ontologies are specified with property-based restrictions on class membership, then such consistency can be checked automatically. If no such logical restrictions are applied, as is the case with many biological ontologies, there are currently no automated methods for measuring the semantic consistency of instance assignment on an ontology-wide scale, nor for inferring the patterns of properties that might define a particular class. We constructed a program that takes as its input an OWL/RDF knowledge base containing an ontology, instances associated with each of the classes in the ontology, and properties of those instances. For each class, it outputs: 1) a rule for determining class membership based on the properties of the instances and 2) a quantitative score for the class that reflects the ability of the identified rule to correctly predict class membership for the instances in the knowledge base. We evaluated this program using both artificial knowledge bases of known quality and real, widely used ontologies. The results indicate that the suggested method can be used to conduct objective, automatic, data-driven evaluations of biological ontologies without formal class definitions in regards to the property-based consistency of instance-assignment. This inductive method complements existing, purely deductive approaches to automatic consistency checking, offering not just the potential to help in the ontology engineering process but also in the knowledge discovery process.",15,['cs'],10

We show that 63% of the observed expression divergence across seven Drosophila species are adaptive changes driven by directional selection. Our results are derived from the variation of expression within species and the time-resolved divergence across a family of related species, using a new inference method for selection.

1508.07378,q-bio,"Evolutionary hypotheses to explain the greater numbers of species in the tropics than the temperate zone include greater age and area, higher temperature and metabolic rates, and greater ecological opportunity. These ideas make contrasting predictions about the relationship between speciation processes and latitude, which I elaborate and evaluate. Available data suggest that per capita speciation rates are currently highest in the temperate zone, and that diversification rates (speciation minus extinction) are similar between latitudes. In contrast, clades whose oldest analyzed dates precede the Eocene thermal maximum, when the extent of the tropics was much greater than today, tend to show highest speciation and diversification rates in the tropics. These findings are consistent with age and area, which is alone among hypotheses in predicting a time trend. Higher recent speciation rates in the temperate zone than the tropics suggest an additional response to high ecological opportunity associated with low species diversity. These broad patterns are compelling but provide limited insights into underlying mechanisms, arguing that studies of speciation processes along the latitudinal gradient will be vital. Using threespine stickleback in depauperate northern lakes as an example, I show how high ecological opportunity can lead to rapid speciation. The results support a role for ecological opportunity in speciation, but its importance in the evolution of the latitudinal gradient remains uncertain. I conclude that per-capita evolutionary rates are no longer higher in the tropics than the temperate zone. Nevertheless, the vast numbers of species that have already accumulated in the tropics ensure that total rate of species production remains highest there.

However, the experiment includes several sources of noise which cause both low-frequency errors and spurious high-frequency alterations. Therefore, rigorous statistical analysis is required in order to separate true T-to-C base changes, following cross-linking, from noise. So far, most of the existing PAR-CLIP data analysis methods focus on discarding the low-frequency errors and rely on high-frequency substitutions to report binding sites, not taking into account the possibility of high-frequency false positive substitutions.

We next analyze two new measures of spatial population heterogeneity. In particular we study the typical length scale of genetic heterogeneity during the carcinogenesis process and estimate the extent of a surrounding premalignant clone given a clinical observation of a premalignant point biopsy.

To reveal origins of this inconsistency, we have examined general features of biological systems as dynamical systems far from not only their chemical equilibrium, but, in most cases, also of their Lyapunov stable states. Thus, in biological experiments, we do not observe states, but distinct trajectories followed by the examined organism. If one of the possible sequences is selected, a minute sub-section of the whole problem is obtained, sometimes in a seemingly highly reproducible manner. But the state of the organism is known only if a complete set of possible trajectories is known. And this is often practically impossible. Therefore, we propose a different framework for reporting and analysis of biological experiments, respecting the view of non-linear mathematics. This view should be used to avoid overoptimistic results, which have to be consequently retracted or largely complemented.

Under frequency dependent selection, the average fitness of the population may increase or decrease based on interactions between individuals within the population.

Here, we propose a stochastic model, which naturally combines these two evolutionary ingredients by assuming frequency dependent competition between different types in an individual-based model. In contrast to previous game theoretic models, the carrying capacity of the population and thus the population size is determined by pairwise competition of individuals mediated by evolutionary games and demographic stochasticity. In the limit of infinite population size, the averaged stochastic dynamics is captured by the deterministic competitive Lotka-Volterra equations. In small populations, demographic stochasticity may instead lead to the extinction of the entire population.

Our main tool for the analysis are adaptive walks, an idealized dynamics by which the population moves uphill in fitness and terminates at a local fitness maximum. We use three different types of walks and investigate how their length (the number of steps required to reach a local peak) and height (the fitness at the endpoint of the walk) depend on the dimensionality and structure of the landscape. We find that the distribution of local maxima over the landscape is particularly sensitive to the choice of interaction pattern.

We investigate the consequences of modeling the interaction between STI transmission and prophylactic use with a model that links a Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) system to evolutionary game dynamics that determine the effective contact rate. The combined model framework allows us to address protective behavior by both infected and susceptible individuals. Feedback between behavioral adaptation and prevalence creates a wide range of dynamic behaviors in the combined model, including damped and sustained oscillations as well as bistability, depending on the behavioral parameters and disease growth rate. We found that disease extinction is possible for multiple regions where R0 > 1, due to behavior adaptation driving the epidemic downward, although conversely endemic prevalence for arbitrarily low R0 is also possible if contact rates are sufficiently high. We also tested how model misspecification might affect disease forecasting and estimation of the model parameters and R0.

In this field, quantitative analyses of the data employing sound theoretical models, have played a major role in interpreting data and anticipating outcomes of experiments. Here, we explain how by using temperature as a variable in mechanical unfolding of biomolecules in force spectroscopy, the roughness of the energy landscape can be measured without making any assumptions about the underlying reaction coordinate. Estimates of other aspects of the energy landscape such as free energy barriers or the transition state (TS) locations could depend on the precise model used to analyze the experimental data. We illustrate the inherent difficulties in obtaining the transition state location from loading rate or force-dependent unfolding rates. Because the transition state moves as the force or the loading rate is varied, which is reminiscent of the Hammond effect, it is in general difficult to invert the experimental data. The independence of the TS location on force holds good only for brittle or hard biomolecules whereas the TS location changes considerably if the molecule is soft or plastic.

Since proteins half-lives can be comparable to the cell-cycle length, randomness in cell-division times generates additional intercellular variability in protein levels. Moreover, as many mRNA/protein species are expressed at low-copy numbers, errors incurred in partitioning of molecules between the mother and daughter cells are significant. We derive analytical formulas for the total noise in protein levels for a general class of cell-division time and partitioning error distributions. Using a novel hybrid approach the total noise is decomposed into components arising from i) stochastic expression; ii) partitioning errors at the time of cell-division and iii) random cell-division events. These formulas reveal that random cell-division times not only generate additional extrinsic noise but also critically affect the mean protein copy numbers and intrinsic noise components. Counter intuitively, in some parameter regimes noise in protein levels can decrease as cell-division times become more stochastic. Computations are extended to consider genome duplication, where the gene dosage is increased by two-fold at a random point in the cell-cycle. We systematically investigate how the timing of genome duplication influences different protein noise components. Intriguingly, results show that noise contribution from stochastic expression is minimized at an optimal genome duplication time. Our theoretical results motivate new experimental methods for decomposing protein noise levels from single-cell expression data. Characterizing the contributions of individual noise mechanisms will lead to precise estimates of gene expression parameters and techniques for altering stochasticity to change phenotype of individual cells.",15,[],10

1502.03816,q-bio,"We explore the hypothesis that the relative abundance of feedback loops in many empirical complex networks is severely reduced owing to the presence of an inherent global directionality. Aimed at quantifying this idea, we propose a simple probabilistic model in which a free parameter equation controls the degree of inherent directionality. Upon strengthening such directionality, the model predicts a drastic reduction in the fraction of loops which are also feedback loops. To test this prediction, we extensively enumerated loops and feedback loops in many empirical biological, ecological and socio- technological directed networks. We show that, in almost all cases, empirical networks have a much smaller fraction of feedback loops than network randomizations. Quite remarkably, this empirical finding is quantitatively reproduced, for all loop lengths, by our model by fitting its only parameter equation. Moreover, the fitted value of equation correlates quite well with another direct measurement of network directionality, performed by means of a novel algorithm. We conclude that the existence of an inherent network directionality provides a parsimonious quantitative explanation for the observed lack of feedback loops in empirical networks.",15,['physics'],10
1501.04268,q-bio,"The Cancer Genome Atlas project was initiated by the National Cancer Institute in order to characterize the genomes of hundreds of tumors of various cancer types. While much effort has been put into detecting somatic genomic variation in these data, somatic structural variation induced by the activity of transposable element insertions has not been reported. Transposable elements (TEs) are particularly relevant in cancer in part because of several known cases in which a TE insertion is directly linked to cancer formation and studies linking the epigenetic status of retrotransposons to carcinogenesis and patient outcome. Additionally, evidence for somatic retrotransposition in eukaryotic genomes suggests that some tissues and therefore some cancer types may be disposed to increased retrotransposition. We built upon previous work to develop a highly efficient computational pipeline for the detection of non-reference mobile ele- ment insertions from high-throughput paired-end whole genome sequencing data that is capable of detecting breakpoints through a local assembly strategy. Using this, we analyzed 33 whole genome tumor datasets with paired normal samples from TCGA across 3 different cancer types: glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), ovarian serous cystoadenocarcinoma (OV) and colorectal ade- nocarcinoma (COAD). We detected 72 insertions in colon samples, almost all of them LINE-1 elements, and none in GBM or OV. The amount of somatic retrotransposition varies widely between samples with 61 insertions present in one case. The lack of somatic retrotransposon insertions in GBM and OV samples suggests that TE activity in cancer is restricted to certain cancer types.",15,[],10

Under a classic four-letter alphabet, we provide a complete characterization of designable structures without unpaired bases. When unpaired bases are allowed, we provide partial characterizations for classes of designable/undesignable structures, and show that the class of designable structures is closed under the stutter operation. Membership of a given structure to any of the classes can be tested in linear time and, for positive instances, a solution can be found in linear time.

1508.00623,q-bio,"It is now widely recognized that mechanical interactions between cells play a crucial role in epithelial morphogenesis, yet understanding the mechanisms through which stress and deformation affect cell behavior remains an open problem due to the complexity inherent in the mechanical behavior of cells and the difficulty of direct measurement of forces within tissues. Theoretical models can help by focusing experimental studies and by providing the framework for interpreting measurements. To that end, ""vertex models"" have introduced an approximation of epithelial cell mechanics based on a polygonal tiling representation of planar tissue. Here we formulate and analyze an Active Tension Network (ATN) model, which is based on the same polygonal representation of epithelial tissue geometry, but in addition i) assumes that mechanical balance is dominated by cortical tension and ii) introduces tension dependent local remodeling of the cortex, representing the active nature of cytoskeletal mechanics. The tension-dominance assumption has immediate implications for the geometry of cells, which we demonstrate to hold in certain types of Drosophila epithelial tissues. We demonstrate that stationary configurations of an ATN form a manifold with one degree of freedom per cell, corresponding to ""isogonal"" - i.e. angle preserving - deformations of cells, which dominate the dynamic response to perturbations. We show that isogonal modes account for approximately 90% of experimentally observed deformation of cells during the process of ventral furrow formation in Drosophila. Other interesting properties of our model include the exponential screening of mechanical stress and a negative Poisson ratio response to external uniaxial stress. We also provide a new approach to the problem of inferring local cortical tensions from the observed geometry of epithelial cells in a tissue",15,[],10
1507.01962,q-bio,"Cancer cells utilize large amounts of ATP to sustain growth, relying primarily on non-oxidative, fermentative pathways for its production. In many types of cancers this leads, even in the presence of oxygen, to the secretion of carbon equivalents (usually in the form of lactate) in the cell's surroundings, a feature known as the Warburg effect. While the molecular basis of this phenomenon are still to be elucidated, it is clear that the spilling of energy resources contributes to creating a peculiar microenvironment for tumors, possibly characterized by a degree of toxicity. This suggests that mechanisms for recycling the fermentation products (e.g. a lactate shuttle) may be active, effectively inducing a mutually beneficial metabolic coupling between aberrant and non-aberrant cells. Here we analyze this scenario through a large-scale in silico metabolic model of interacting human cells. By going beyond the cell-autonomous description, we show that elementary physico-chemical constraints indeed favor the establishment of such a coupling under very broad conditions. The characterization we obtained by tuning the aberrant cell's demand for ATP, amino-acids and fatty acids and/or the imbalance in nutrient partitioning provides quantitative support to the idea that synergistic multi-cell effects play a central role in cancer sustainment.",15,[],10

The approximation algorithms previously developed for the MBL problem are only applicable to genetic maps in which genes or markers are represented as signed integers. However, current genetic mapping techniques generally do not specify gene strandedness so that genes can only be represented as unsigned integers. In this paper, we study the MBL problem in the latter more realistic case.

Our model predicts that equation of mRNAs are segregated to the poles and reveals a ""circulation"" of ribosomes driven by the flux of mRNAs, from synthesis in the nucleoid to degradation at the poles.

1508.04561,q-bio,"Conspiracy theories, or in general seriously distorted beliefs, are widespread. How and why are they formed in the brain is still more a matter of speculation rather than science. In this paper one plausible mechanisms is investigated: rapid freezing of high neuroplasticity (RFHN). Emotional arousal increases neuroplasticity and leads to creation of new pathways spreading neural activation. Using the language of neurodynamics a meme is defined as quasi-stable associative memory attractor state. Depending on the temporal characteristics of the incoming information and the plasticity of the network, memory may self-organize creating memes with large attractor basins, linking many unrelated input patterns. Memes with fake rich associations distort relations between memory states. Simulations of various neural network models trained with competitive Hebbian learning (CHL) on stationary and non-stationary data lead to the same conclusion: short learning with high plasticity followed by rapid decrease of plasticity leads to memes with large attraction basins, distorting input pattern representations in associative memory. Such system-level models may be used to understand creation of distorted beliefs and formation of conspiracy memes, understood as strong attractor states of the neurodynamics.",15,[],10

However, temporal turnover is the consequence of unidirectional community dynamics resulting from processes such as population growth, colonisation and local extinction. Here, we develop a framework based on community dynamics, and propose a new temporal turnover measure. A simulation study and an analysis of an estuarine fish community both clearly demonstrate that our proposed turnover measure offers additional insights relative to spatial-context-based metrics. Our approach reveals whether community turnover is due to shifts in community composition or in community abundance, and identifies the species and/or environmental factors that are responsible for any change.",15,['stat'],10
1506.06446,q-bio,"Under the multispecies coalescent model of molecular evolution, gene trees have independent evolutionary histories within a shared species tree. In comparison, supermatrix concatenation methods assume that gene trees share a single common genealogical history, thereby equating gene coalescence with species divergence. The multispecies coalescent is supported by previous studies which found that its predicted distributions fit empirical data, and that concatenation is not a consistent estimator of the species tree. *BEAST, a fully Bayesian implementation of the multispecies coalescent, is popular but computationally intensive, so the increasing size of phylogenetic data sets is both a computational challenge and an opportunity for better systematics. Using simulation studies, we characterize the scaling behaviour of *BEAST, and enable quantitative prediction of the impact increasing the number of loci has on both computational performance and statistical accuracy. Follow up simulations over a wide range of parameters show that the statistical performance of *BEAST relative to concatenation improves both as branch length is reduced and as the number of loci is increased. Finally, using simulations based on estimated parameters from two phylogenomic data sets, we compare the performance of a range of species tree and concatenation methods to show that using *BEAST with tens of loci can be preferable to using concatenation with thousands of loci. Our results provide insight into the practicalities of Bayesian species tree estimation, the number of loci required to obtain a given level of accuracy and the situations in which supermatrix or summary methods will be outperformed by the fully Bayesian multispecies coalescent.",15,[],10
1511.03963,q-bio,We examine immunostaining experimental data for the formation of the strip 2 of equation (equation) transcripts on equation equation embryos. An estimate of the factor converting immunofluorescence intensity units into molecular numbers is given. The analysis of the equation mRNA's dynamics at the region of the stripe 2 suggests that the promoter site of the gene has two distinct regimes: an earlier phase when it is predominantly activated until a critical time when it becomes mainly repressed. That suggests proposing a stochastic binary model for gene transcription on equation equation embryos. Our model has two random variables: the transcripts number and the state of the source of mRNAs given as active or repressed. We are able to reproduce available experimental data for the average number of transcripts. An analysis of the random fluctuations on the number of equation mRNA's and their consequences on the spatial precision of the stripe 2 is presented. We show that the position of the anterior/posterior borders fluctuate around their average position by equation of the embryo length which is similar to what is found experimentally. The fitting of data by such a simple model suggests that it can be useful to understand the functions of randomness during developmental processes.,15,[],10
1511.03011,q-bio,"Three-dimensional protein structures usually contain regions of local order, called secondary structure, such as equation-helices and equation-sheets. Secondary structure is characterized by the local rotational state of the protein backbone, quantified by two dihedral angles called equation and equation. Particular types of secondary structure can generally be described by a single (diffuse) location on a two-dimensional plot drawn in the space of the angles equation and equation, called a Ramachandran plot. By contrast, a recently-discovered nanomaterial made from peptoids, structural isomers of peptides, displays a secondary-structure motif corresponding to two regions on the Ramachandran plot [Mannige et al., Nature 526, 415 (2015)]. In order to describe such `higher-order' secondary structure in a compact way we introduce here a means of describing regions on the Ramachandran plot in terms of a single Ramachandran number, equation, which is a structurally meaningful combination of equation and equation. We show that the potential applications of equation are numerous: it can be used to describe the geometric content of protein structures, and can be used to draw diagrams that reveal, at a glance, the frequency of occurrence of regular secondary structures and disordered regions in large protein datasets.

1511.01388,q-bio,"A disease that caused by dengue virus (DENV) has become the major health problem of the world. Nowadays, no effective treatment is available to overcome the disease due to the level of dengue virus pathogeneses. A novel treatment method such as antiviral drug is highly necessary for coping with the dengue disease. Envelope protein is one of the non-structural proteins of DENV, which engaged in the viral fusion process. The fusion process is mediated by the conformational change in the protein structure from dimer to trimer state. The previous research showed the existing cavity on the dimer structure of the envelope protein. The existing ligand could get into cavity of the envelope protein, stabilize the dimer structure or hamper the transition of dimer protein into trimer. In this fashion, the fusion process can be prevented. The aim of this research is designing the cyclic peptide with prolin-prolin bond as fusion inhibitor of DENV envelope protein through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. The screening of 3,883 cyclic peptides, each of them connected by prolin-prolin bond, through molecular docking resulted in five best ligands. The pharmacological and toxicity character of these five ligands were analised in silico. The result showed that PYRRP was the best ligand. PAWRP was also chosen as the best ligand because it showed good affinity with protein cavity. Stability of ligand-protein complex was analyzed by molecular dynamics simulation. The result showed that PYRRP ligand was able to support the stability of DENV envelope protein dimer structure at 310 K and 312 K. While PAWRP ligand actively formed complex with the DENV envelope protein at 310 K compared to 312 K. Thus the PYRRP ligand has a potential to be developed as DENV fusion inhibitor.",15,[],10
1510.02356,q-bio,"Phylogenetic inference can potentially result in a more accurate tree using data from multiple loci. However, if the loci are incongruent--due to events such as incomplete lineage sorting or horizontal gene transfer--it can be misleading to infer a single tree. To address this, many previous contributions have taken a mechanistic approach, by modelling specific processes. Alternatively, one can cluster loci without assuming how these incongruencies might arise. Such ""process-agnostic"" approaches typically infer a tree for each locus and cluster these. There are, however, many possible combinations of tree distance and clustering methods; their comparative performance in the context of tree incongruence is largely unknown. Furthermore, because standard model selection criteria such as AIC cannot be applied to problems with a variable number of topologies, the issue of inferring the optimal number of clusters is poorly understood. Here, we perform a large-scale simulation study of phylogenetic distances and clustering methods to infer loci of common evolutionary history. We observe that the best-performing combinations are distances accounting for branch lengths followed by spectral clustering or Ward's method. We also introduce two statistical tests to infer the optimal number of clusters and show that they strongly outperform the silhouette criterion, a general-purpose heuristic. We illustrate the usefulness of the approach by (i) identifying errors in a previous phylogenetic analysis of yeast species and (ii) identifying topological incongruence among newly sequenced loci of the globeflower fly genus Chiastocheta.

We also show that the addition of within-group enforcement further promotes the evolution of public cooperation. However, although the group size in this context has nonlinear effects on collective action, an intermediate group size is least conductive to cooperative behaviour. This contradicts recent field observations, where an intermediate group size was declared optimal with the conjecture that group-size effects and within-group enforcement are responsible.

In these graphs, the vertices correspond to the small areas of the gray matter, and two vertices are connected by an edge, if a diffusion-MRI based workflow finds connections between those areas. One main question of the field is discovering the directions of the edges. In a previous work we have reported the construction of the Budapest Reference Connectome Server http://connectome.pitgroup.org from the data recorded in the Human Connectome Project of the NIH. After the server had been published, we recognized a surprising and unforeseen property of it: The server can generate the braingraph of connections that are present in at least equation graphs out of the 418, for any value of equation. When the value of equation is changed from equation through 1 by moving a slider at the webserver from right to left, more and more edges appear in the consensus graph. The astonishing observation is that the appearance of the new edges is not random: it is similar to a growing tree. We hypothesize that this movement of the slider in the webserver may copy the development of the connections in the human brain in the following sense: the connections that are present in all subjects are the oldest ones, and those that are present in a decreasing fraction of subjects are gradually the newer connections in the individual brain development. An animation on the phenomenon is available at https://youtu.be/EnWwIfHNjw. Based on this hypothesis, we can assign directions to the edges of the connectome as follows: Let equation denote the consensus connectome where each edge is present in at least equation graphs.

Integrated Information Theory (IIT) of consciousness provides a mathematical approach to quantifying the information integrated in a system, called integrated information, equation. Integrated information is defined theoretically as the amount of information a system generates as a whole, above and beyond the sum of the amount of information its parts independently generate. IIT predicts that the amount of integrated information in the brain should reflect levels of consciousness. Empirical evaluation of this theory requires computing integrated information from neural data acquired from experiments, although difficulties with using the original measure equation precludes such computations. Although some practical measures have been previously proposed, we found that these measures fail to satisfy the theoretical requirements as a measure of integrated information. Measures of integrated information should satisfy the lower and upper bounds as follows: The lower bound of integrated information should be 0 when the system does not generate information (no information) or when the system comprises independent parts (no integration). The upper bound of integrated information is the amount of information generated by the whole system and is realized when the amount of information generated independently by its parts equals to 0.

However, the estimated brain-wide densities of 64 cell types published recently were based on one series of co-registered coronal in situ hybridization (ISH) images per gene, whereas the online ABA contains several image series per gene, including sagittal ones.

Several species of teleosts are known to have magnetoreception based in biogenic magnetite, and direct magnetic field detection also has support in several species of elasmobranchs. The overly narrow focus of earlier papers on the unsupported hypothesis that magnetoreception in elasmobranchs is based in the ampullae of Lorenzini creates the impression that all teleosts will be insensitive to magnetic deterrents. However, magnetite based magnetoreception has been demonstrated in several teleosts, and is supported in others. Furthermore, electroreception is present in many teleost species; therefore, the possibility of induction based indirect magnetoreception should be considered. Finally, experiments reported as demonstrating insensitivity in teleost species to magnetic deterrents suffer from inadequate design and sample sizes to reject the hypothesis of magnetic detection in any given species.

Here, we performed perturbation analysis of a large-scale signal transduction model in extracellular environments that stimulate cell death, growth, motility, and quiescence. Each of the model's components was perturbed under both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations. We identified the most and least influential components based on the magnitude of their influence on the rest of the system. Based on the premise that the most influential components might serve as better drug targets, we characterized them for biological functions, housekeeping genes, essential genes, and druggable proteins. Moreover, known cancer drug targets were also classified in influential components based on the affected components in the network. Additionally, the systemic perturbation analysis of the model revealed a network motif of most influential components which affect each other. Furthermore, our analysis predicted novel combinations of cancer drug targets with various effects on other most influential components. We found that the combinatorial perturbation consisting of PI3K inactivation and overactivation of IP3R1 can lead to increased activity levels of apoptosis-related components and tumor suppressor genes, suggesting that this combinatorial perturbation may lead to a better target for decreasing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Lastly, our results suggest that systematic perturbation analyses of large-scale computational models may serve as an approach to prioritize and assess signal transduction components in order to identify novel drug targets in complex disorders.",15,[],10

As an example, we consider two typical generalized synchronizations in a designed optomechanical system. Unlike the effort to construct a special coupling synchronization system, we purposefully design extra control fields based on Lyapunov control theory.

We show how this latter force can be related to the known oscillating Casimir--Polder force on an excited atom near a (ground-state) body. Our force also reveals a population-induced dynamics: for times much larger that the atomic lifetime the atoms will decay to their ground-states leading to the van der Waals interaction between ground-state atoms.",15,[],6

1511.01309,quant-ph,"We theoretically investigate the coupling of an ultracold three-level atomic gas and a nano-mechanical mirror via classical electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pressure on the mirror is modulated by absorption of a probe light field, caused by the atoms which are electromagnetically rendered nearly transparent, allowing the gas to affect the mirror. In turn, the mirror can affect the gas as its vibrations generate opto-mechanical sidebands in the control field. We show that the sidebands cause modulations of the probe intensity at the mirror frequency, which can be enhanced near atomic resonances. Through the radiation pressure from the probe beam onto the mirror, this results in resonant driving of the mirror. Controllable by the two photon detuning, the phase relation of the driving to the mirror motion decides upon amplification or damping of mirror vibrations.

Here, we show that, for different sets of resource-theoretic thermodynamic operations, the amount of entropy produced along a transition is characterized by how reversible the process is. More specifically, this entropy production depends on how well we can return the state equation to its original form equation without investing any work. At the same time, the entropy production can be linked to the work that can be extracted along a given transition, and we explore the consequences that this fact has for our results.

However, since dynamical locality is strictly weaker than local causality, this leaves open the question of whether an ontological model for quantum mechanics can be both separable and dynamically local. We answer this question in the affirmative, using an ontological model based on previous work by Deutsch and Hayden. Although the original formulation of the model avoids Bell's theorem by denying that measurements result in single, definite outcomes, we show that the model can alternatively be cast in the framework of ontological models, where Bell's theorem does apply.

In the special case of the random mixed states sampled from the induced measure via partial tracing of random bipartite pure states, we establish the typicality of the relative entropy of coherence for random mixed states invoking the concentration of measure phenomenon. Our results also indicate that mixed quantum states are less useful compared to pure quantum states in higher dimension when we extract quantum coherence as a resource. This is because of the fact that average coherence of random mixed states is bounded uniformly, however, the average coherence of random pure states increases with the increasing dimension. As an important application, we establish the typicality of relative entropy of entanglement and distillable entanglement for a specific class of random bipartite mixed states. In particular, most of the random states in this specific class have relative entropy of entanglement and distillable entanglement equal to some fixed number (to within an arbitrary small error), thereby hugely reducing the complexity of computation of these entanglement measures for this specific class of mixed states.",15,"['math-ph', 'math']",6

Using a theory based on pure-dephasing Lindblad evolution, we find that the pumping is contributed by two parts of different nature, a dephasing-modified geometric part weighted by initial Bloch state populations, and an interband-coherence-induced part compromised by dephasing, both of them being independent of the pumping time scale. The overall pumping reflects an interplay of the band topology, initial state populations, initial state coherence, and dephasing.

In particular, the transition direction shows odd-even sensitivity to the number of lattice sites. We have also revealed that our proposed CDT-CT transition is robust against the second order coupling (SOC) between next-nearest-neighbor sites in odd-equation-site systems, whereas localization can be significantly enhanced by SOC in even-equation-site systems.

If the variables are corrupted by noise then this approach maximises the likelihood that the solution found is correct. An alternative approach is to make use of prior statistical information about the noise in conjunction with Bayes's theorem. The maximum entropy solution to the problem then takes the form of a Boltzmann distribution over the ground and excited states of the cost function. Here we use a programmable Josephson junction array for the information decoding problem which we simulate as a random Ising model in a field. We show experimentally that maximum entropy decoding at finite temperature can in certain cases give competitive and even slightly better bit-error-rates than the maximum likelihood approach at zero temperature, confirming that useful information can be extracted from the excited states of the annealing device. Furthermore we introduce a microscopic bit-by-bit analytical method which is agnostic to the specific application and use it to show that the annealing device samples from a highly Boltzmann-like distribution. Machines of this kind are therefore candidates for use in a wide variety of machine learning applications which exploit maximum entropy inference, including natural language processing and image recognition. We further show that the limiting factor for performance in our experiments is likely to be control errors rather than failure to reach equilibrium.

1506.00855,quant-ph,"The eigenvalues of a non-Hermitian Hamilton operator are complex and provide not only the energies but also the lifetimes of the states of the system. They show a non-analytical behavior at singular (exceptional) points (EPs). The eigenfunctions are biorthogonal, in contrast to the orthogonal eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator. A quantitative measure for the ratio between biorthogonality and orthogonality is the phase rigidity of the wavefunctions. At and near an EP, the phase rigidity takes its minimum value. The lifetimes of two nearby eigenstates of a quantum system bifurcate under the influence of an EP. When the parameters are tuned to the point of maximum width bifurcation, the phase rigidity suddenly increases up to its maximum value. This means that the eigenfunctions become almost orthogonal at this point. This unexpected result is very robust as shown by numerical results for different classes of systems. Physically, it causes an irreversible stabilization of the system by creating local structures that can be described well by a Hermitian Hamilton operator. Interesting non-trivial features of open quantum systems appear in the parameter range in which a clustering of EPs causes a dynamical phase transition.",15,[],6

1503.04763,quant-ph,"We introduce a new continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocol, self-referenced CV-QKD, that eliminates the need for transmission of a high-power local oscillator between the communicating parties. In this protocol, each signal pulse is accompanied by a reference pulse (or a pair of twin reference pulses), used to align Alice's and Bob's measurement bases. The method of phase estimation and compensation based on the reference pulse measurement can be viewed as a quantum analog of intradyne detection used in classical coherent communication, which extracts the phase information from the modulated signal. We present a proof-of-principle, fiber-based experimental demonstration of the protocol and quantify the expected secret key rates by expressing them in terms of experimental parameters. Our analysis of the secret key rate fully takes into account the inherent uncertainty associated with the quantum nature of the reference pulse(s) and quantifies the limit at which the theoretical key rate approaches that of the respective conventional protocol that requires local oscillator transmission. The self-referenced protocol greatly simplifies the hardware required for CV-QKD, especially for potential integrated photonics implementations of transmitters and receivers, with minimum sacrifice of performance. As such, it provides a pathway towards scalable integrated CV-QKD transceivers, a vital step towards large-scale QKD networks.",15,['physics'],6

The amplification is induced in the difference signal of both detectors allowing robustness to different sources of technical noise, and offering in addition the advantages of balanced signals for precision metrology. All of the Fisher information about the parameter of interest is collected, and a phase controls the amplification response.

Despite the fact that the theory is more than 100 years old, we are still discussing its foundations and its regime of applicability. A point of crucial importance is the definition of the notion of thermal equilibrium, which is given as the state that maximises the von Neumann entropy. Here we argue that it is necessary to propose a new way of describing thermal equilibrium, focused on observables rather than on the full state of the quantum system. We characterise the notion of thermal equilibrium, for a given observable, via the maximisation of its Shannon entropy and highlight the thermal properties that such a principle heralds. The relation with Gibbs ensembles is brought to light. Furthermore, we apply such a notion of equilibrium to a closed quantum systems and prove that there is always a class of observables which exhibits thermal equilibrium properties and we give a recipe to explicitly construct them. Eventually, we bring to light an intimate connection of such a principle with the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis.",15,[],6

1506.01231,quant-ph,"We review our models of quantum associative memories that represent the ""quantization"" of fully coupled neural networks like the Hopfield model. The idea is to replace the classical irreversible attractor dynamics driven by an Ising model with pattern-dependent weights by the reversible rotation of an input quantum state onto an output quantum state consisting of a linear superposition with probability amplitudes peaked on the stored pattern closest to the input in Hamming distance, resulting in a high probability of measuring a memory pattern very similar to the input. The unitary operator implementing this transformation can be formulated as a sequence of one-qubit and two-qubit elementary quantum gates and is thus the exponential of an ordered quantum Ising model with sequential operations and with pattern-dependent interactions, exactly as in the classical case. Probabilistic quantum memories, that make use of postselection of the measurement result of control qubits, overcome the famed linear storage limitation of their classical counterparts because they permit to completely \it eliminate crosstalk and spurious memories. The number of control qubits plays the role of an inverse fictitious temperature, the accuracy of pattern retrieval can be tuned by lowering the fictitious temperature under a critical value for quantum content association while the complexity of the retrieval algorithm remains polynomial for any number of patterns polynomial in the number of qubits. These models solve thus the capacity shortage problem of classical associative memories, providing a \it polynomial improvement in capacity.

New entropic uncertainty relations are studied for a higher-dimensional quantum state with multiple measurements, the uncertainty bounds can be tighter than that expected from two measurements settings and cannot result from qubits system with or without a quantum memory.

1506.02938,quant-ph,"Quantum mechanics is derived from the principle that the universe contain as much variety as possible, in the sense of maximizing the distinctiveness of each subsystem.   The quantum state of a microscopic system is defined to correspond to an ensemble of subsystems of the universe with identical constituents and similar preparations and environments. A new kind of interaction is posited amongst such similar subsystems which acts to increase their distinctiveness, by extremizing the variety. In the limit of large numbers of similar subsystems this interaction is shown to give rise to Bohm's quantum potential. As a result the probability distribution for the ensemble is governed by the Schroedinger equation.   The measurement problem is naturally and simply solved. Microscopic systems appear statistical because they are members of large ensembles of similar systems which interact non-locally. Macroscopic systems are unique, and are not members of any ensembles of similar systems. Consequently their collective coordinates may evolve deterministically.

Then we study the effect over the quantum correlations of a mass imbalance between the impurity and the bosons. In the strongly interacting case, we discover that when the impurity is much heavier than the bosons, then we have the least possible correlation.

In this article, using an equivalence between measurement incompatibility (non joint measurability) and steering, we find the optimal violation amount of this inequality in quantum theory. Interestingly, the optimal violation amount matches with optimal quantum violation of CHSH inequality, i.e., Cirel'son quantity.

While the effective current that acts on the photons is known explicitly, the exact effective potential that describes the forces exerted by the photons on the electrons is obtained from a fixed-point inversion scheme. This procedure allows us to uncover important beyond-mean-field features of the effective potential which mark the breakdown of classical light-matter interactions. We observe peak and step structures in the effective potentials, which can be attributed solely to the quantum nature of light, i.e., they are real-space signatures of the photons.

The first approach investigates how strong focusing of light onto a single ion can increase the interaction strength to achieve efficient interaction between a photon and the ion.

Rather we show that the spread of the unmeasured particle carries no dependence on the width of its virtual confinement in the published configuration. Instead, it spreads geometrically at a rate determined by the numerical aperture of the ghost imaging system.

1508.05194,quant-ph,"Bohmian mechanics, a hydrodynamic formulation of quantum mechanics, relies on the concept of trajectory, which evolves in time in compliance with dynamical information conveyed by the wave function.

Furthermore, this procedure also supplies a more robust explanation of interference phenomena, which currently is only based on the superposition principle. That is, while this principle only describes how different waves combine and what effects these combinations may lead to, flow lines provide a more precise explanation on how the energy or probability propagate in space before, during and after the combination of such waves, without dealing with them separately (i.e., the combination or superposition is taken as a whole). In this sense, concepts such as constructive and destructive interference, typically associated with the superposition principle, physically correspond to more or less dense swarms of (energy or probability) flow lines, respectively. A direct consequence of this description is that, when considering the distribution of electromagnetic energy flow lines behind two slits, each one covered by a differently oriented polarizer, it is naturally found that external observers' information on the slit crossed by single photons (understood as energy parcels) is totally irrelevant for the existence of interference fringes, in striking contrast with what is commonly stated and taught.",15,[],6
