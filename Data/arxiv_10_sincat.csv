1009.2194,astro-ph,"The Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS) has uncovered a population of strongly-lensed submillimeter galaxies (SMGs). The Zpectrometer instrument on the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) was used to measure the redshifts and constrain the masses of the cold molecular gas reservoirs for two candidate high-redshift lensed sources. We derive CO(1-0) redshifts of z=3.042/-0.001 and z=2.625/-0.001, and measure molecular gas masses of (1--3)x1010Msun, corrected for lens amplification and assuming a conversion factor of alhpa=0.8 Msun(K km/s pc2)-1. We find typical L(IR)/L'(CO) ratios of 120/-40 and 140/-50 Lsun (K km/s pc2)-1, which are consistent with those found for local ULIRGs and other high-redshift SMGs. From analysis of published data, we find no evidence for enhanced L(IR)/L'(CO(1-0)) ratios for the SMG population in comparison to local ULIRGs. The GBT results highlight the power of using the CO lines to derive blind redshifts, which is challenging for the SMG population at optical wavelengths given their high obscuration.",2010,[],5
1011.1125,astro-ph,"In light of the growing interest in searching for low mass, rocky planets, we investigate the impact of starspots on radial velocity searches for earth-mass planets in orbit about M dwarf stars. Since new surveys targeting M dwarfs will likely be carried out at infrared wavelengths, a comparison between V and Y band starspot induced jitter is made, indicating a reduction of up to an order of magnitude when observing in the Y band. The exact reduction in jitter is dependent on the photosphere to spot contrast ratio, with greater improvements at smaller contrasts. We extrapolate a model used to describe solar spot distributions to simulate the spot patterns that we expect to find on M dwarfs. Under the assumption that M dwarfs are near or fully convective, we randomly place starspots on the stellar surface, simulating different levels of spot coverage. Line profiles, distorted by spots are derived and are used to investigate the starspot induced jitter. By making assumptions about the degree of spot activity, detection limits for earth-mass planets in habitable zones are simulated for between 10 and 500 observation epochs. We find that <= 50 epochs are required to detect 1 - 2 MEarth planets (with < 1 per cent false alarm probability) orbiting slowly rotating 0.1 and 0.2 MSun stars. This sensitivity decreases when typical rotation velocities and activity levels for each stellar mass/spectral type are considered. No detections of below 20 MEarth planets are expected for <= 500 observations for the most active stars with vsini >= 20 km/s and dark spots.",2010,[],5
1003.1259,astro-ph,"In this work, we study a class of early dark energy (EDE) models, in which, unlike in standard DE models, a substantial amount of DE exists in the matter-dominated era, self-consistently including DE perturbations. Our analysis shows that, marginalizing over the non DE parameters such as equation, current CMB observations alone can constrain the scale factor of transition from early DE to late time DE to equation and width of transition to equation. The equation of state at present is somewhat weakly constrained to equation, if we allow equation km/s/Mpc. Taken together with other observations, such as supernovae, HST, and SDSS LRGs, the constraints are tighter-- equation. The evolution of the equation of state for EDE models is thus close to equationCDM at low redshifts. Incorrectly assuming DE perturbations to be negligible leads to different constraints on the equation of state parameters, thus highlighting the necessity of self-consistently including DE perturbations in the analysis. If we allow the spatial curvature to be a free parameter, then the constraints are relaxed to equation with equation for CMBother observations. For perturbed EDE models, the equation lower limit on equation (equation) is much lower than that in equationCDM (equation), thus raising the interesting possibility of discriminating EDE from equationCDM using future observations such as halo mass functions or the Sunyaev-Zeldovich power spectrum.",2010,[],5
1011.3513,astro-ph,"The detection of galaxy clusters in present and future surveys enables measuring mass-to-light ratios, clustering properties or galaxy cluster abundances and therefore, constraining cosmological parameters. We present a new technique for detecting galaxy clusters, which is based on the Matched Filter Algorithm from a Bayesian point of view. The method is able to determine the position, redshift and richness of the cluster through the maximization of a filter depending on galaxy luminosity, density and photometric redshift combined with a galaxy cluster prior. We tested the algorithm through realistic mock galaxy catalogs, revealing that the detections are 100% complete and 80% pure for clusters up to z <1.2 and richer than letter > 25 (Abell Richness > 0). We applied the algorithm to the CFHTLS Archive Research Survey (CARS) data, recovering similar detections as previously published using the same data plus additional clusters that are very probably real. We also applied this algorithm to the Deep Lens Survey (DLS), obtaining the first sample of optical-selected galaxy in this survey. The sample is complete up to redshift 0.7 and we detect more than 780 cluster candidates up to redshift 1.2. We conclude by discussing the differences between previous weak lensing detections in this survey and optical detections in both samples.",2010,[],5
1002.0023,astro-ph,"Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), a large-scale radio Cherenkov observatory which scientists propose to develop in Antarctica, aims at discovering the origin and evolution of the cosmic accelerators that produce the highest energy cosmic rays by means of observing the ultra high energy (UHE) cosmogenic neutrinos. To optimize ARA's angular resolution of the incoming UHE neutrinos, which is essential for pointing pack to its source, the relation between the reconstruction capabilities of ARA and its design is studied. It is found that with the noise effect taken into account, in order to make this neutrino angular resolution as good as possible and detection efficiency as high as possible, the optimal choice for ARA geometry would be the station spacing of 1.6 km and the antenna spacing of 40 m.",2010,[],5
1011.1075,astro-ph,We discuss some of the main open issues related to the light-up and evolution of the first accreting sources powering high redshift luminous quasars.

1010.2785,astro-ph,"We report the arcsecond resolution SMA observations of the equationCO (2-1) transition in the massive cluster forming region G10.6-0.4. In these observations, the high velocity equationCO emission is resolved into individual outflow systems, which have a typical size scale of a few arcseconds. These molecular outflows are energetic, and are interacting with the ambient molecular gas. By inspecting the shock signatures traced by CHequationOH, SiO, and HCN emissions, we suggest that abundant star formation activities are distributed over the entire 0.5 pc scale dense molecular envelope. The star formation efficiency over one global free-fall timescale (of the 0.5 pc molecular envelope, equation years) is about a few percent. The total energy feedback of these high velocity outflows is higher than 10equation erg, which is comparable to the total kinetic energy in the rotational motion of the dense molecular envelope. From order-of-magnitude estimations, we suggest that the energy injected from the protostellar outflows is capable of balancing the turbulent energy dissipation. No high velocity bipolar molecular outflow associated with the central OB cluster is directly detected, which can be due to the photo-ionization.",2010,[],5
1001.4794,astro-ph,"We present a stable and convergent method for studying a system of gas and dust, coupled through viscous drag in both non-stiff and stiff regimes. To account for the effects of dust drag in the update of the fluid quantities, we employ a fluid description of the dust component and study the modified gas-dust hyperbolic system following the approach in Miniati & Colella (2007). In addition to two entropy waves for the gas and dust components, respectively, the extended system includes three waves driven partially by gas pressure and partially by dust drift, which, in the limit of vanishing coupling, tend to the two original acoustic waves and the unhindered dust streaming. Based on this analysis we formulate a predictor step providing first order accurate reconstruction of the time-averaged state variables at cell interfaces, whence a second order accurate estimate of the conservative fluxes can be obtained through a suitable linearized Riemann solver. The final source term update is carried out using a one-step, second order accurate, L-stable, predictor corrector asymptotic method (the alpha-QSS method suggested by Mott et. al. 2000). This procedure completely defines a two-fluid method for gas-dust system. Using the updated fluid solution allows us to then advance the individual particle solutions, including self-consistently the time evolution of the gas velocity in the estimate of the drag force. This is done with a suitable particle scheme also based on the alpha-QSS method. A set of benchmark problems shows that our method is stable and convergent. When dust is modeled as a fluid (two-fluid) second order accuracy is achieved in both stiff and non-stiff regimes, whereas when dust is modeled with particles (hybrid) second order is achieved in the non-stiff regime and first order otherwise.",2010,[],5
1010.6073,astro-ph,"Observations of sun-like stars rotating faster than our current sun tend to exhibit increased magnetic activity as well as magnetic cycles spanning multiple years. Using global simulations in spherical shells to study the coupling of large-scale convection, rotation, and magnetism in a younger sun, we have probed effects of rotation on stellar dynamos and the nature of magnetic cycles. Major 3-D MHD simulations carried out at three times the current solar rotation rate reveal hydromagnetic dynamo action that yields wreaths of strong toroidal magnetic field at low latitudes, often with opposite polarity in the two hemispheres. Our recent simulations have explored behavior in systems with considerably lower diffusivities, achieved with sub-grid scale models including a dynamic Smagorinsky treatment of unresolved turbulence. The lower diffusion promotes the generation of magnetic wreaths that undergo prominent temporal variations in field strength, exhibiting global magnetic cycles that involve polarity reversals. In our least diffusive simulation, we find that magnetic buoyancy coupled with advection by convective giant cells can lead to the rise of coherent loops of magnetic field toward the top of the simulated domain.",2010,[],5
1007.1881,astro-ph,"Supernovae of Type IIb contain large fractions of helium and traces of hydrogen, which can be observed in the early and late spectra. Estimates of the hydrogen and helium mass and distribution are mainly based on early-time spectroscopy and are uncertain since the respective lines are usually observed in absorption. Constraining the mass and distribution of H and He is important to gain insight into the progenitor systems of these SNe.   We implement a NLTE treatment of hydrogen and helium in a three-dimensional nebular code. Ionisation, recombination, (non-)thermal electron excitation and Hequation line scattering are taken into account to compute the formation of Hequation, which is by far the strongest H line observed in the nebular spectra of SNe IIb. Other lines of H and He are also computed but are rarely identified in the nebular phase. Nebular models are computed for the Type IIb SNe 1993J, 2001ig, 2003bg and 2008ax as well as for SN 2007Y, which shows Hequation absorption features at early times and strong Hequation emission in its late phase, but has been classified as a SN Ib. We suggest to classify SN 2007Y as a SN IIb. Optical spectra exist for all SNe of our sample, and there is one IR nebular observation of SN 2008ax, which allows an exploration of its helium mass and distribution.   We develop a three-dimensional model for SN 2008ax. We obtain estimates for the total mass and kinetic energy in good agreement with the results from light-curve modelling found in the literature. We further derive abundances of He, C, O, Ca and equationNi. We demonstrate that Hequation absorption is probably responsible for the double-peaked profile of the [O \sc i] equation 6300, 6363 doublet in several SNe IIb and present a mechanism alternative to shock interaction for generating late-time Hequation emission of SNe IIb.",2010,[],5
1003.4207,astro-ph,"The orbital period of the recurrent nova U Sco has been observed to decrease during the 1999 outburst. In an outburst mass is ejected from the surface of the white dwarf. The separation of the binary system widens and the orbital period increases. We find that magnetic braking between outbursts, mass transfer to the companion, and frictional angular momentum losses during outbursts are all too small to account for this unexpected change. We find, however, that if the secondary has a sufficiently strong magnetic field, B=8x103 G, then the ejected material can couple to it and corrotate with the system. The ejected material gains angular momentum while the binary system loses it and the period decreases. If such a strong magnetic field is indeed present, then we predict that a period decrease should be observed also during the current 2010 outburst. If, however, the presence of such a field can be ruled out observationally, then the cause for the period decrease (if confirmed) remains unknown.",2010,[],5
1005.2125,astro-ph,"Protostellar jets are known to emit in a wide range of bands, from radio to IR to optical bands, and to date also about ten X-ray emitting jets have been detected, with a rate of discovery of about one per year. We aim at investigating the mechanism leading to the X-ray emission detected in protostellar jets and at constraining the physical parameters that describe the jet/ambient interaction by comparing our model predictions with observations. We perform 2D axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction between a supersonic jet and the ambient. The jet is described as a train of plasma blobs randomly ejected by the stellar source along the jet axis. We explore the parameter space by varying the ejection rate, the initial jet Mach number, and the initial density contrast between the ambient and the jet. We synthesized from the model the X-ray emission as it would be observed with the current X-ray telescopes. The mutual interactions among the ejected blobs and of the blobs with the ambient medium lead to complex X-ray emitting structures within the jet: irregular chains of knots; isolated knots with measurable proper motion; apparently stationary knots; reverse shocks. The predicted X-ray luminosity strongly depends on the ejection rate and on the initial density contrast between the ambient and the jet, with a weaker dependence on the jet Mach number. Our model represents the first attempt to describe the X-ray properties of all the X-ray emitting protostellar jets. The comparison between our model predictions and the observations can provide a useful diagnostic tool necessary for a proper interpretation of the observations. In particular, we suggest that the observable quantities derived from the spectral analysis of X-ray observations can be used to constrain the ejection rate, a parameter explored in our model that is not measurable by current observations.",2010,[],5
1009.5939,astro-ph,"According to a recent ray-based asymptotic theory, the high-frequency p-mode spectrum of rapidly rotating stars is a superposition of frequency subsets associated with dynamically independent regions of the ray-dynamics phase space. At high rotation rates corresponding to typical equation Scuti stars, two frequency subsets are expected to be visible : a regular frequency subset described by a Tassoul like formula and an irregular frequency subset with specific statistical properties. In this paper, we investigate whether the regular patterns can be detected in the resulting spectrum. We compute the autocorrelation function of synthetic spectra where the frequencies follow the asymptotic theory, the relative amplitudes are simply given by the modes' disk-averaging factors, and the frequency resolution is that of a CoRoT long run. Our first results are that (i) the detection of regular patterns strongly depends on the ratio of regular over irregular modes, (ii) low inclination angle configurations are more favorable than near equator-on configurations, (iii) in the absence of differential rotation, the equation rotational splitting between equation and equation modes is an easy feature to detect.",2010,[],5
1003.4861,astro-ph,We briefly overview our newly developed radiation transport module for MHD simulations and two actual applications. The method combines the advantage of the speed of the Flux-Limited Diffusion approximation and the high accuracy obtained in ray-tracing methods.,2010,[],5
1006.0775,astro-ph,"We use galaxy groups at redshifts between 0.4 and 1.0 selected from the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) to study the color-morphological properties of satellite galaxies, and investigate possible alignment between the distribution of the satellites and the orientation of their central galaxy. We confirm the bimodal color and morphological type distribution for satellite galaxies at this redshift range: the red and blue classes corresponds to the early and late morphological types respectively, and the early-type satellites are on average brighter than the late-type ones. Furthermore, there is a \it morphological conformity between the central and satellite galaxies: the fraction of early-type satellites in groups with an early-type central is higher than those with a late-type central galaxy. This effect is stronger at smaller separations from the central galaxy. We find a marginally significant signal of alignment between the major axis of the early-type central galaxy and its satellite system, while for the late-type centrals no significant alignment signal is found. We discuss the alignment signal in the context of shape evolution of groups.",2010,[],5
1011.3111,astro-ph,"The Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope provides an unprecedented opportunity to study gamma-ray blazars. To capitalize on this opportunity, beginning in late 2007, about a year before the start of LAT science operations, we began a large-scale, fast-cadence 15 GHz radio monitoring program with the 40-m telescope at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO). This program began with the 1158 northern (declination>-20 deg) sources from the Candidate Gamma-ray Blazar Survey (CGRaBS) and now encompasses over 1500 sources, each observed twice per week with a ~4 mJy (minimum) and 3% (typical) uncertainty. Here, we describe this monitoring program and our methods, and present radio light curves from the first two years (2008 and 2009). As a first application, we combine these data with a novel measure of light curve variability amplitude, the intrinsic modulation index, through a likelihood analysis to examine the variability properties of subpopulations of our sample. We demonstrate that, with high significance (7-sigma), gamma-ray-loud blazars detected by the LAT during its first 11 months of operation vary with about a factor of two greater amplitude than do the gamma-ray-quiet blazars in our sample. We also find a significant (3-sigma) difference between variability amplitude in BL Lacertae objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), with the former exhibiting larger variability amplitudes. Finally, low-redshift (z<1) FSRQs are found to vary more strongly than high-redshift FSRQs, with 3-sigma significance. These findings represent an important step toward understanding why some blazars emit gamma-rays while others, with apparently similar properties, remain silent.",2010,[],5
1009.0480,astro-ph,"The recent development of a new minimum mass solar nebula, under the assumption that the giant planets formed in the compact configuration of the Nice model, has shed new light on planet formation in the solar system. Desch previously found that a steady state protoplanetary disk with an outer boundary truncated by photoevaporation by an external massive star would have a steep surface density profile. In a completely novel way, we have adapted numerical methods for solving propagating phase change problems to astrophysical disks. We find that a one-dimensional time-dependent disk model that self-consistently tracks the location of the outer boundary produces shallower profiles than those predicted for a steady state disk. The resulting surface density profiles have a radial dependence of Sigma(r) \alpha r(-1.250.88-0.33) with a power-law exponent that in some models becomes as large as ~Sigma(r) \alpha r(-2.1). The evolutionary timescales of the model disks can be sped up or slowed down by altering the amount of far-ultraviolet flux or the viscosity parameter alpha. Slowing the evolutionary timescale by decreasing the incident far ultraviolet flux, or similarly by decreasing alpha, can help to grow planets more rapidly, but at the cost of decreased migration timescales. Although they similarly affect relevant timescales, changes in the far ultraviolet flux or alpha produce disks with drastically different outer radii. Despite their differences, these disks are all characterized by outward mass transport, mass loss at the outer edge, and a truncated outer boundary. The transport of mass from small to large radii can potentially prevent the rapid inward migration of Jupiter and Saturn, while at the same time supply enough mass to the outer regions of the disk for the formation of Uranus and Neptune.",2010,[],5
1001.4800,astro-ph,"[ABRIDGED] We present the results of a 3 year monitoring program of a sample of very low mass (VLM) field binaries using both astrometric and spectroscopic data obtained in conjunction with the laser guide star adaptive optics system on the W.M. Keck II 10 m telescope. Fifteen systems have undergone sufficient orbital motion, allowing us to derive their relative orbital parameters and hence their total system mass. These measurements triple the number of masses for VLM objects. Among the 11 systems with both astrometric and spectroscopic measurements, six have sufficient radial velocity variations to allow us to obtain individual component masses. This is the first derivation of the component masses for five of these systems. Altogether, the orbital solutions of these low mass systems show a correlation between eccentricity and orbital period, consistent with their higher mass counterparts. In our primary analysis, we find that there are systematic discrepancies between our dynamical mass measurements and the predictions of theoretical evolutionary models (TUCSON and LYON) with both models either underpredicting or overpredicting the most precisely determined dynamical masses. These discrepancies are a function of spectral type, with late M through mid L systems tending to have their masses underpredicted, while one T type system has its mass overpredicted. These discrepancies imply that either the temperatures predicted by evolutionary and atmosphere models are inconsistent for an object of a given mass, or the mass-radius relationship or cooling timescales predicted by the evolutionary models are incorrect. If these spectral type trends hold into the planetary mass regime, the implication is that the masses of directly imaged extrasolar planets are overpredicted by the evolutionary models.",2010,[],5
1004.1971,astro-ph,"We present a new method for determining the age of late-K type pre-main sequence (PMS) stars by deriving their surface gravity from high-resolution I-band spectroscopy. Since PMS stars contract as they evolve, age can be estimated from surface gravity. We used the equivalent width ratio (EWR) of nearby absorption lines to create a surface gravity diagnostic of PMS stars that is free of uncertainties due to veiling. The ratios of Fe (818.67nm and 820.49nm) and Na (818.33nm and 819.48nm) absorption lines were calculated for giants, main-sequence stars, and weak-line T Tauri stars. Effective temperatures were nearly equal across the sample. The Fe to Na EWR (Fe/Na) decreases significantly with increasing surface gravity, denoting that Fe/Na is a desirable diagnostic for deriving the surface gravity of pre-main sequence stars. The surface gravity of PMS stars with 0.8 solar mass is able to be determined with an accuracy of 0.1-0.2, which conducts the age of PMS stars within a factor of 1.5, in average.",2010,[],5
1001.4243,astro-ph,"Recent high-precision measurements of the isotopic composition of lunar rocks demonstrate that the bulk silicate Earth and the Moon show an unexpectedly high degree of similarity. This is inconsistent with one of the primary results of classic dynamical simulations of the widely accepted giant impact model for the formation of the Moon, namely that most of the mass of the Moon originates from the impactor, not Earth.   Resolution of this discrepancy without changing the main premises of the giant impact model requires total isotopic homogenisation of Earth and impactor material after the impact for a wide range of elements including O, Si, K, Ti, Nd and W. Even if this process could explain the O isotope similarity, it is unlikely to work for the much heavier, refractory elements. Given the increasing uncertainty surrounding the giant impact model in light of these geochemical data, alternative hypotheses for lunar formation should be explored. In this paper, we revisit the hypothesis that the Moon was formed directly from terrestrial mantle material. We show that the dynamics of this scenario requires a large amount of energy, almost instantaneously generated additional energy. The only known source for this additional energy is nuclear fission. We show that it is feasible to form the Moon through the ejection of terrestrial silicate material triggered by a nuclear explosion at Earths core-mantle boundary (CMB), causing a shock wave propagating through the Earth. Hydrodynamic modelling of this scenario shows that a shock wave created by rapidly expanding plasma resulting from the explosion disrupts and expels overlying mantle and crust material.",2010,[],5
1005.3020,astro-ph,"Recent observations of excited CO emission lines from z~2 disc galaxies have shed light on the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation at high-z via observed SFR-CO (J=2-1) and (J=3-2) relations. Here, we describe a novel methodology for utilising these observations of high-excitation CO to derive the underlying Schmidt (SFR-rhoN) relationship. To do this requires an understanding of the potential effects of differential CO excitation with SFR. If the most heavily star-forming galaxies have a larger fraction of their gas in highly excited CO states than the lower SFR galaxies, then the observed molecular SFR-COalpha index, alpha, will be less than the underlying (volumetric) Schmidt index, N. Utilising a combination of SPH models of galaxy evolution and molecular line radiative transfer, we present the first calculations of CO excitation in z~2 disc galaxies with the aim of developing a mapping between various observed SFR-CO relationships and the underlying Schmidt relation. We find that even in relatively luminous z~2 discs, differential excitation does indeed exist, resulting in alpha < N for highly excited CO lines. This means that an observed (e.g.) SFR-CO (J=3-2) relation does not map linearly to SFR-H2 relation. We utilise our model results to provide a mapping from alpha to N for the range of Schmidt indices N=1-2. By comparing to recent observational surveys, we find that the observed SFR-CO (J=2-1) and SFR-CO (J=3-2) relations suggest that an underlying SFR rho1.5 relation describes z~2 disc galaxies.",2010,[],5
1001.4097,astro-ph,"The gamma-ray energy spectra of bright blazars of the LAT Bright AGN Sample (LBAS) are investigated using Fermi-LAT data. Spectral properties (hardness, curvature and variability) established using a data set accumulated over 6 months of operation are presented and discussed for different blazar classes and subclasses: Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), Low-synchrotron peaked BLLacs (LSP-BLLacs), Intermediate-synchrotron peaked BLLacs (ISP-BLLacs) and High-synchrotron peaked BLLacs (HSP-BLLacs). The distribution of photon index (obtained from a power-law fit above 100 MeV) is found to correlate strongly with blazar subclass. The change in spectral index from that averaged over the six month observing period is < 0.2-0.3 when the flux varies by about an order of magnitude, with a tendency toward harder spectra when the flux is brighter for FSRQs and LSP-BLLacs. A strong departure from a single power-law spectrum appears to be a common feature for FSRQs. This feature is also present for some high-luminosity LSP-BLLacs, and a small number of ISP-BLLacs. It is absent in all LBAS HSP-BLLacs. For 3C 454.3 and AO 0235164, the two brightest FSRQ source and LSP-BLLac source respectively, a broken power law gives the most acceptable of power law, broken power law, and curved forms. The consequences of these findings are discussed.",2010,[],5
1004.3426,astro-ph,"We consider the horizontal branch (HB) of the Globular Cluster Terzan 5, recently shown to be split into two parts, the fainter one (delta MK ~ 0.3mag) having a lower metallicity than the more luminous. Both features show that it contains at least two stellar populations. The separation in magnitude has been ascribed to an age difference of ~6 Gyr and interpreted as the result of an atypical evolutionary history for this cluster. We show that the observed HB morphology is also consistent with a model in which the bright HB is composed of second generation stars that are metal enriched and with a helium mass fraction larger (by delta Y ~ 0.07) than that of first generation stars populating the fainter part of the HB. Terzan 5 would therefore be anomalous, compared to most ""normal"" clusters hosting multiple populations, only because its second generation is strongly contaminated by supernova ejecta; the previously proposed prolonged period of star formation, however, is not required. The iron enrichment of the bright HB can be ascribed either to contamination from Type Ia supernova ejecta of the low-iron, helium rich, ejecta of the massive asympotic giant branch stars of the cluster, or to its mixing with gas, accreting on the cluster from the environment, that has been subject to fast metal enrichment due to its proximity with the galactic bulge.

1001.0787,astro-ph,"We investigate the chemical interaction between Saturn's corotating plasma and Enceladus' volcanic plumes. We evolve plasma as it passes through a prescribed H2O plume using a physical chemistry model adapted for water-group reactions. The flow field is assumed to be that of a plasma around an electrically-conducting obstacle centered on Enceladus and aligned with Saturn's magnetic field, consistent with Cassini magnetometer data. We explore the effects on the physical chemistry due to: (1) a small population of hot electrons; (2) a plasma flow decelerated in response to the pickup of fresh ions; (3) the source rate of neutral H2O. The model confirms that charge exchange dominates the local chemistry and that H3O dominates the water-group composition downstream of the Enceladus plumes. We also find that the amount of fresh pickup ions depends heavily on both the neutral source strength and on the presence of a persistent population of hot electrons.",2010,[],5
1011.2390,astro-ph,"Aims: We aim to develop a method to determine distances to molecular clouds using JHK near-infrared photometry. Methods: The method is based on a technique that aids spectral classification of stars lying towards the fields containing the clouds into main sequence and giants. In this technique, the observed (J-H) and (H-Ks) colours are dereddened simultaneously using trial values of A V and a normal interstellar extinction law. The best fit of the dereddened colours to the intrinsic colours giving a minimum value of Chi2 then yields the corresponding spectral type and AV for the star. The main sequence stars, thus classified, are then utilized in an A V versus distance plot to bracket the cloud distances. Results: We applied the method to four clouds, L1517, Chamaeleon I, Lupus 3 and NGC 7023 and estimated their distances as 167-30, 151-28, 157-29 and 408-76 pc respectively, which are in good agreement with the previous distance estimations available in the literature",2010,[],5
1008.1983,astro-ph,"We present L' band (3.8 equation) MMT/Clio high-contrast imaging data for the nearby star GJ 758, which was recently reported by Thalmann et al.

Additionally, we report a \textitpossible detection of the object identified by Thalmann et al as 'GJ 758C"" in our more sensitive dataset, though it is likely a residual speckle. However, if it is the same object as that reported by Thalmann et al. it cannot be a companion in a bound orbit. GJ 758B has a H-L' color redder than nearly all known L--T8 dwarfs. Based on comparisons with the COND evolutionary models, GJ 758B has Tequation equation 560 Kequation and a mass ranging from equation 10--20 Mequation if it is equation 1 Gyr old to equation 25--40 Mequation if it is 8.7 Gyr old. GJ 758B is likely in a highly eccentric orbit, e equation 0.73equation, with a semimajor axis of equation 44 AUequation.

We find significant cluster-centric radial gradients in Hequation, Mgb and C4668 for the passive galaxies. We use state-of-the-art stellar population models \citepschiavon07 and the measured absorption line indices to infer the single-stellar-population-equivalent (SSP-equivalent) age and [Fe/H] for each galaxy, as well as their abundance patterns in terms of [Mg/Fe], [C/Fe], [N/Fe] and [Ca/Fe]. For the passive galaxy subsample we find strong evidence for ""archaeological downsizing"", with age equation. We recover significant cluster-centric radial stellar population gradients for the passive sample in SSP-equivalent age, [Mg/Fe], [C/Fe] and [N/Fe]. These trends are in the sense that, at fixed velocity dispersion, passive galaxies on the outskirts of the cluster are 24% equation 9% younger with lower [Mg/Fe] and [N/Fe] but higher [C/Fe] than those in the cluster core. We find no significant increase in cluster-centric radial stellar population gradients when fitting to a passive galaxy subset selected to cover the cluster core and South-West region, which contains the NGC 4839 subgroup. Thus we conclude that the NGC 4839 in-fall region is not unique, at least in terms of the stellar populations of bright galaxies. We speculate that the more pronounced cluster-centric radial gradients seen by other recent studies may be attributed to the luminosity range spanned by their samples, rather than to limited azimuthal coverage of the cluster.(abridged)",2010,[],5
1009.5310,astro-ph,"We have detected an Halpha bow shock nebula around PSR J1741-2054, a pulsar discovered through its GeV gamma-ray pulsations. The pulsar is only ~1.5"" behind the leading edge of the shock. Optical spectroscopy shows that the nebula is non-radiative, dominated by Balmer emission. The Halpha images and spectra suggest that the pulsar wind momentum is equatorially concentrated and implies a pulsar space velocity ~150km/s, directed 15/-10deg out of the plane of the sky. The complex Halpha profile indicates that different portions of the post-shock flow dominate line emission as gas moves along the nebula and provide an opportunity to study the structure of this unusual slow non-radiative shock under a variety of conditions. CXO ACIS observations reveal an X-ray PWN within this nebula, with a compact ~2.5"" equatorial structure and a trail extending several arcmin behind. Together these data support a close (<0.5kpc) distance, a spin geometry viewed edge-on and highly efficient gamma-ray production for this unusual, energetic pulsar.",2010,[],5

1004.2335,astro-ph,"We present results of an imaging observation of the central region of a giant radio galaxy B1358305. The classical, standard scenario of Fanaroff-Riley II radio galaxies suggests that shock produced hot electrons contained in a radio galaxy are a good reservoir of the jet-supplied energy from active nuclei. The aim of our observation is to search for the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect induced by these hot electrons. The observation was performed at 21 GHz with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. Deep imaging observation of a wide region of size 6.7'x6.7' with the beam size thetaHPBW=81.2"" enables the most detailed examination of the possible thermal energy of electrons contained in a radio galaxy. The resultant intensity fluctuation is 0.56 mJy/beam (in terms of the Compton y-parameter, y=1.04x 10-4) at a 95 percent confidence level. The intensity fluctuation obtained with imaging analysis sets the most stringent upper limit on the fluctuations in the central region of a giant radio galaxy obtained so far, and our results will be a toehold for future plans of SZE observation in a radio galaxy.",2010,[],5

As part of an X-ray survey of supposedly single Wolf-Rayet stars, we observed WR 142 and the surrounding Berkeley 87 region with Chandra ACIS-I. We detect WR 142 as a faint, yet extremely hard X-ray source. Due to weak emission, its nature as a thermal or nonthermal emitter is unclear and thus we discuss several emission mechanisms. Additionally, we report seven detections and eight non-detections by Chandra of massive OB stars in Berkeley 87, two of which are bright yet soft X-ray sources whose spectra provide a dramatic contrast to the hard emission from WR 142.",2010,[],5

We determine Teff, log(g), micro-turbulent velocity, vsin(i), metallicity, and elemental abundance for 14 of the 16 candidate stars, two of the stars are spectroscopic binaries. No significant influence of NLTE effects on the results could be found. For hot stars, we find systematic deviations of the determined effective temperatures from those given in the Kepler Input Catalogue. The deviations are confirmed by the results obtained from ground-based photometry. Five stars show reduced metallicity, two stars are He-strong, one is He-weak, and one is Si-strong.

The model couples the long-term dynamics of these systems, as derived in the 1-D approximation, with a 1-zone description of the spectral evolution of the emitting plasma. Our goal is to provide a simplified theoretical description that can be used as a tool to put constraints on unknown properties of PWN-SNR systems: a piece of work that is preliminary to any more accurate and sophisticated modeling. In the present paper we apply the newly developed model to a few objects of different ages and luminosities. We find that an injection spectrum in the form of a broken-power law gives a satisfactory description of the emission for all the systems we consider. More surprisingly, we also find that the intrinsic spectral break turns out to be at a similar energy for all sources, in spite of the differences mentioned above. We discuss the implications of our findings on the workings of pulsar magnetospheres, pair multiplicity and on the particle acceleration mechanism(s) that might be at work at the pulsar wind termination shock.",2010,[],5

This process may cause the altering of electric current flow through inner gap and consequently the current losses with the same time scale as precession period equation. It occurs because of electric current in inner gaps is determined by Goldreich-Julian charge density equation, which are depend on angle between direction of small scale magnetic field and angular velocity equation.

1010.5343,astro-ph,"In recent years, the freely available Monte Carlo code REAS for modelling radio emission from cosmic ray air showers has evolved to include the full complexity of air shower physics. However, it turned out that in REAS2 and all other time-domain models which calculate the radio emission by superposing the radiation of the single air shower electrons and positrons, the calculation of the emission contributions was not fully consistent. In this article, we present a revised implementation in REAS3, which incorporates the missing radio emission due to the variation of the number of charged particles during the air shower evolution using an ""end-point formalism"". With the inclusion of these emission contributions, the structure of the simulated radio pulses changes from unipolar to bipolar, and the azimuthal emission pattern becomes nearly symmetric. Remaining asymmetries can be explained by radio emission due to the variation of the net charge excess in air showers, which is automatically taken into account in the new implementation. REAS3 constitutes the first self-consistent time-domain implementation based on single particle emission taking the full complexity of air shower physics into account, and is freely available for all interested users.",2010,[],5
1006.3768,astro-ph,"We study the topology of cosmic large-scale structure through the genus statistics, using galaxy catalogues generated from the Millennium Simulation and observational data from the latest Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release (SDSS DR7). We introduce a new method for constructing galaxy density fields and for measuring the genus statistics of its isodensity surfaces. It is based on a Delaunay tessellation field estimation (DTFE) technique that allows the definition of a piece-wise continuous density field and the exact computation of the topology of its polygonal isodensity contours, without introducing any free numerical parameter. Besides this new approach, we also employ the traditional approaches of smoothing the galaxy distribution with a Gaussian of fixed width, or by adaptively smoothing with a kernel that encloses a constant number of neighboring galaxies. Our results show that the Delaunay-based method extracts the largest amount of topological information. Unlike the traditional approach for genus statistics, it is able to discriminate between the different theoretical galaxy catalogues analyzed here, both in real space and in redshift space, even though they are based on the same underlying simulation model. In particular, the DTFE approach detects with high confidence a discrepancy of one of the semi-analytic models studied here compared with the SDSS data, while the other models are found to be consistent.",2010,[],5
1011.4168,astro-ph,"Favored theories of giant planet formation center around two main paradigms, namely the core accretion model and the gravitational instability model. These two formation scenarios support the hypothesis that the giant planet metallicities should be higher or equal to that of the parent star. Meanwhile, spectra of the transiting hot Jupiter HD189733b suggest that carbon and oxygen abundances range from depleted to enriched with respect to the star. Here, using a model describing the formation sequence and composition of planetesimals in the protoplanetary disk, we determine the range of volatile abundances in the envelope of HD189733b that is consistent with the 20--80 Earth-masses of heavy elements estimated to be present in the planet's envelope. We then compare the inferred carbon and oxygen abundances to those retrieved from spectroscopy and we find a range of supersolar values that directly fit both spectra and internal structure models. In some cases, we find that the apparent contradiction between the subsolar elemental abundances and the mass of heavy elements predicted in HD189733b by internal structure models can be explained by the presence of large amounts of carbon molecules in the form of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and soots in the upper layers of the envelope, as suggested by recent photochemical models.

1005.4415,astro-ph,"As the quality and quantity of astrophysical data continue to improve, the precision with which certain astrophysical events can be timed becomes limited not by the data themselves, but by the manner, standard, and uniformity with which time itself is referenced. While some areas of astronomy (most notably pulsar studies) have required absolute time stamps with precisions of considerably better than 1 minute for many decades, recently new areas have crossed into this regime. In particular, in the exoplanet community, we have found that the (typically unspecified) time standards adopted by various groups can differ by as much as a minute. Left uncorrected, this ambiguity may be mistaken for transit timing variations and bias eccentricity measurements. We argue that, since the commonly-used Julian Date, as well as its heliocentric and barycentric counterparts, can be specified in several time standards, it is imperative that their time standards always be reported when accuracies of 1 minute are required. We summarize the rationale behind our recommendation to quote the site arrival time, in addition to using BJDTDB, the Barycentric Julian Date in the Barycentric Dynamical Time standard for any astrophysical event. The BJDTDB is the most practical absolute time stamp for extra-terrestrial phenomena, and is ultimately limited by the properties of the target system. We compile a general summary of factors that must be considered in order to achieve timing precisions ranging from 15 minutes to 1 microsecond. Finally, we provide software tools that, in principal, allow one to calculate BJDTDB to a precision of 1 microsecond for any target from anywhere on Earth or from any spacecraft.",2010,[],5
1004.3971,astro-ph,"The uncertainty in the absolute value of the fluorescence yield is still one of the main contributions to the total error in the reconstruction of the primary energy of ultra-energetic air showers using the fluorescence technique.

In this work we present a comparison of available results normalized to its value in photons/MeV for the 337 nm band at 800 hPa and 293 K. The conversion of photons/m to photons/MeV requires an accurate determination of the energy deposited by the electrons in the field of view of the experimental setup. We have calculated the energy deposition for each experiment by means of a detailed Monte Carlo simulation including when possible the geometrical details of the particular setup.

The gravitational mass is defined by the asymptotic Newtonian potential at large distance from the system, and the inertial mass is defined by the volume integral of the energy density determined from the canonical energy-momentum tensor. In the Brans-Dicke scalar field theory, we establish that the nonminimal coupling and long range of the scalar field leads to an inequality between the gravitational and inertial masses, and we derive an exact formula for this inequality and confirm that it is approximately proportional to the gravitational self-energy (the Nordvedt effect), but with a constant of proportionality different from what is claimed in the published literature in calculations based on the PPN scheme.

1004.2276,gr-qc,"In this, the first of two companion papers, we present a method for finding the gravitational self-force in a modified radiation gauge for a particle moving on a geodesic in a Schwarzschild or Kerr spacetime. An extension of an earlier result by Wald is used to show the spin-weight equation perturbed Weyl scalar (equation or equation) determines the metric perturbation outside the particle up to a gauge transformation and an infinitesimal change in mass and angular momentum. A Hertz potential is used to construct the part of the retarded metric perturbation that involves no change in mass or angular momentum from equation in a radiation gauge. The metric perturbation is completed by adding changes in the mass and angular momentum of the background spacetime outside the radial coordinate equation of the particle in any convenient gauge. The resulting metric perturbation is singular on the trajectory of the particle and discontinuous across the sphere equation. A mode-sum method can be used to renormalize the self-force, but the justification given in the published version of this paper \citesf2 referred to work by Sam Gralla \citegralla10 to justify the use of the renormalized self-force, and the radiation gauge we use does not satisfy the regularity conditions required by Gralla.

The accuracy of our model is established through comparisons against frequency-domain, Teukolsky-based waveforms in the radiative approximation. The calibration of eight high-order post-Newtonian parameters in the energy flux suffices to obtain a phase and fractional amplitude agreement of better than 1 radian and 1 % respectively over a period between 2 and 6 months depending on the system considered. This agreement translates into matches higher than 97 % over a period between 4 and 9 months, depending on the system. Better agreements can be obtained if a larger number of calibration parameters are included. Higher-order mass ratio terms in the effective-one-body Hamiltonian and radiation-reaction introduce phase corrections of at most 30 radians in a one year evolution. These corrections are usually one order of magnitude larger than those introduced by the spin of the small object in a one year evolution. These results suggest that the effective-one-body approach for extreme mass ratio inspirals is a good compromise between accuracy and computational price for LISA data analysis purposes.",2010,[],4

The other possibility is to have unitary symmetry on a complex tangent space of the same dimension as the manifold. In this case the resultant theory is Einstein-Strauss Hermitian gravity. The tangent group is important for matter couplings. We show that in the de Sitter case the 4 dimensional space time vector and scalar are naturally unified by a hidden symmetry being components of a 5d vector in the tangent space.

We apply the Noether procedure to the general N = 1 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma-model and show that it naturally leads to the so-called S-multiplet, revitalized in arXiv:1002.2228.",2010,[],6
1012.5721,hep-th,"We study the torus partition function of the SL(2,R)/U(1) SUSY gauged WZW model coupled to N=2 U(1) current. Starting from the path-integral formulation of the theory, we introduce an infra-red regularization which preserves good modular properties and discuss the decomposition of the partition function in terms of the N=2 characters of discrete (BPS) and continuous (non-BPS) representations. Contrary to our naive expectation, we find a non-holomorphic dependence (dependence on \barletter) in the expansion coefficients of continuous representations. This non-holomorphicity appears in such a way that the anomalous modular behaviors of the discrete (BPS) characters are compensated by the transformation law of the non-holomorphic coefficients of the continuous (non-BPS) characters. Discrete characters together with the non-holomorphic continuous characters combine into real analytic Jacobi forms and these combinations exactly agree with the ""modular completion"" of discrete characters known in the theory of Mock theta functions \citeZwegers.   We consider this to be a general phenomenon: we expect to encounter ""holomorphic anomaly"" (\barletter-dependence) in string partition function on non-compact target manifolds. The anomaly occurs due to the incompatibility of holomorphy and modular invariance of the theory. Appearance of non-holomorphicity in SL(2,R)/U(1) elliptic genus has recently been observed by Troost \citeTroost.",2010,[],6
1011.1485,hep-th,"We explore the Mellin representation of conformal correlation functions recently proposed by Mack. Examples in the AdS/CFT context reinforce the analogy between Mellin amplitudes and scattering amplitudes. We conjecture a simple formula relating the bulk scattering amplitudes to the asymptotic behavior of Mellin amplitudes and show that previous results on the flat space limit of AdS follow from our new formula. We find that the Mellin amplitudes are particularly useful in the case of conformal gauge theories in the planar limit. In this case, the four point Mellin amplitudes are meromorphic functions whose poles and their residues are entirely determined by two and three point functions of single-trace operators. This makes the Mellin amplitudes the ideal objects to attempt the conformal bootstrap program in higher dimensions.",2010,[],6
1011.3499,hep-th,"It was proposed in arXiv:1008.2944 that, for certain gauge theories with gravity duals, electrical conductivity at finite chemical potential is universal. Here we provide a general proof that, when matter stress tensor satisfies a compact constraint, electrical conductivity is universal. We further elaborate our result with several conformal as well as non-conformal gauge theories. We also discuss how boundary conductivity and universal conductivity of stretched horizon are related.",2010,[],6
1008.0813,hep-th,"We compute the low energy decay rates of near-extremal three(four) charge black holes in five(four) dimensional N=4 string theory to sub-leading order in the large charge approximation. This involves studying stringy corrections to scattering amplitudes of a scalar field off a black hole. We adapt and use recently developed techniques to compute such amplitudes as near-horizon quantities. We then compare this with the corresponding calculation in the microscopic configuration carrying the same charges as the black hole. We find perfect agreement between the microscopic and macroscopic calculations; in the cases we study, the zero energy limit of the scattering cross section is equal to four times the Wald entropy of the black hole.",2010,[],6
1007.5241,hep-th,"The dynamical equation-forms of torus reductions of maximal supergravity theory have been shown some time ago to possess remarkable algebraic structures. The set (""dynamical spectrum"") of propagating equation-forms has been described as a (truncation of a) real Borcherds superalgebra equation that is characterized concisely by a Cartan matrix which has been constructed explicitly for each spacetime dimension equation In the equations of motion, each differential form of degree equation is the coefficient of a (super-) group generator, which is itself of degree equation for a specific gradation (the equation-gradation). A slightly milder truncation of the Borcherds superalgebra enables one to predict also the ""spectrum"" of the non-dynamical equation and equation-forms. The maximal supergravity equation-form spectra were reanalyzed more recently by truncation of the field spectrum of equation to the equation-forms that are relevant after reduction from 11 to equation dimensions. We show in this paper how the Borcherds description can be systematically derived from the split (""maximally non compact"") real form of equation for equation This explains not only why both structures lead to the same propagating equation-forms and their duals for equation but also why one obtains the same equation-forms and ""top"" equation-forms. The Borcherds symmetries equation and equation are new too. We also introduce and use the concept of a presentation of a Lie algebra that is covariant under a given subalgebra.",2010,[],6
1005.5719,hep-th,"We find that the conjectured heterotic SO(32) five-brane sigma model develops necessarily k-anomalies, and we investigate their form. We show that these anomalies can be absorbed by modifications of the superspace constraints, that satisfy automatically the modified Bianchi-identity equation of N=1, D=10 supergravity. The k-anomalies induce in particular a quantum deformation of the torsion constraint equation.",2010,[],6
1004.0982,hep-th,"Using the superfield formalism, we study the dynamical breaking of gauge symmetry in the N=1 three-dimensional supersymmetric Chern-Simons model, coupled to a complex scalar superfield with a quartic self-coupling. This is an analogue of the conformally invariant Coleman-Weinberg model in four spacetime dimensions. We show that a mass for the gauge and matter superfields are dynamically generated after two-loop corrections to the effective superpotential. We also discuss the N=2 extension of our work, showing that the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism in such model is not feasible, because it is incompatible with perturbation theory.",2010,[],6
1011.3545,hep-th,"In order to derive a large set of Hamiltonian dynamical systems, but with only first order Lagrangian, we resort to the formulation in terms of Lagrange-Souriau 2-form formalism. A wide class of systems derived in different phenomenological contexts are covered. The non-commutativity of the particle position coordinates are a natural consequence. Some explicit examples are considered.",2010,[],6
1003.5317,hep-th,"We study the transformations of the worldvolume fields of a system of multiple coinciding D-branes under gauge transformations of the supergravity Kalb-Ramond field. We find that the pure gauge part of these NS-NS transformations can be written as a U(N) symmetry of the underlying Yang-Mills group, but that in general the full NS-NS variations get mixed up non-trivially with the U(N). We compute the commutation relations and the Jacobi identities of the bigger group formed by the NS-NS and U(N) transformations.",2010,[],6
