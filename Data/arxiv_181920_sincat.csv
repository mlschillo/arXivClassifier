1811.07926,astro-ph,"The LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) is an ongoing sensitive, high-resolution 120-168MHz survey of the entire northern sky for which observations are now 20% complete. We present our first full-quality public data release. For this data release 424 square degrees, or 2% of the eventual coverage, in the region of the HETDEX Spring Field (right ascension 10h45m00s to 15h30m00s and declination 45equation00equation00equation to 57equation00equation00equation) were mapped using a fully automated direction-dependent calibration and imaging pipeline that we developed. A total of 325,694 sources are detected with a signal of at least five times the noise, and the source density is a factor of equation higher than the most sensitive existing very wide-area radio-continuum surveys. The median sensitivity is SequationJy beamequation and the point-source completeness is 90% at an integrated flux density of 0.45mJy. The resolution of the images is 6equation and the positional accuracy is within 0.2equation. This data release consists of a catalogue containing location, flux, and shape estimates together with 58 mosaic images that cover the catalogued area. In this paper we provide an overview of the data release with a focus on the processing of the LOFAR data and the characteristics of the resulting images. In two accompanying papers we provide the radio source associations and deblending and, where possible, the optical identifications of the radio sources together with the photometric redshifts and properties of the host galaxies. These data release papers are published together with a further equation20 articles that highlight the scientific potential of LoTSS.",18,[],1
1808.07065,astro-ph,"We present a detailed census of galaxies in and around PC217.9632.3, a spectroscopically confirmed Coma analog at z=3.78. Diverse galaxy types identified in the field include Lya emitters (LAEs), massive star-forming galaxies, and ultra-massive galaxies (log (Mstar/Msun)>= 11) which may have already halted their star formation. The sky distribution of the star-forming galaxies suggests the presence of a significant overdensity (deltag=8/-2), which is spatially offset from the previously confirmed members by 3-4 Mpc to the west. Candidate quiescent and post-starburst galaxies are also found in large excess (a factor of ~ 8-15 higher surface density than the field) although their redshifts are less certain. We estimate that the total enclosed mass traced by star-forming galaxy candidates is roughly comparable to that of PC217.9632.3 traced by the LAEs. We speculate that the true extent of PC217.9632.3 may be larger than previously known, a half of which is missed by our LAE selection. Alternatively, the newly discovered overdensity may belong to another Coma progenitor not associated with PC217.9632.3. Expectations from theory suggest that both scenarios are equally unlikely (<1%), particularly in the cosmic volume probed in our survey. If confirmed as a single structure, its total mass will be well in excess of Coma, making this a singularly large cosmic structure rarely seen even in large cosmological simulations. Finally, we find that the protocluster galaxies follow the same SFR-Mstar scaling relation as the field galaxies, suggesting that the environmental effect at z~4 is a subtle one at best for normal star-forming galaxies.",18,[],1
1811.11130,astro-ph,"We used extra-tidal RR Lyrae stars to study the dynamics of Galactic globular clusters and know how effects like dynamical friction and tidal disruption affect these clusters. The Gaia DR2 catalog for RR Lyrae stars (Clementini et al. 2018) is used along with the proper motions and tidal radii data for the globular clusters compiled from literature. A sample of 56 Galactic globular clusters is analyzed. Out of these 56 Galactic globular clusters, only 11 have extra-tidal RR Lyrae stars. However, only two clusters, namely, NGC 3201 and NGC 5024, have enough extra-tidal RR Lyrae stars to draw interesting conclusions. NGC 3201 has 13 extra-tidal RR Lyrae stars which are asymmetrically distributed around its center with more number of stars in its trailing zone than its leading part. We conclude that these asymmetrical tidal tails are due to the combined effect of tidal disruption and the stripped debris from the cluster. On the other hand, NGC 5024 has 5 extra-tidal RR Lyrae stars, four of them are concentrated in a region which is at a distance of about 3 times the tidal radius from its center. These may be the stars that are being ripped apart from the cluster due to tidal disruption. The presence of these extra-tidal RR Lyrae stars in the clusters can be an indication that more cluster stars are present outside their tidal radii which may be revealed by deep wide field CMDs of the clusters.",18,[],1
1801.00985,astro-ph,"CONTEXT:At low redshift, early-type galaxies often exhibit a rising flux with decreasing wavelength in the 1000-2500 \AA range, called ""UV upturn"". The origin of this phenomenon is debated, and its evolution with redshift is poorly constrained. The observed GALEX FUV-NUV color can be used to probe the UV upturn approximately to redshift 0.5. AIMS: We provide constraints on the existence of the UV upturn up to redshift equation 0.4 in the brightest cluster galaxies (BCG) located behind the Virgo cluster, using data from the GUViCS survey. METHODS:We estimate the GALEX far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) observed magnitudes for BCGs from the maxBCG catalog in the GUViCS fields. We increase the number of nonlocal galaxies identified as BCGs with GALEX photometry from a few tens of galaxies to 166 (64 when restricting this sample to relatively small error bars). We also estimate a central color within a 20 arcsec aperture. By using the equation-band luminosity from the maxBCG catalog, we can separate blue FUV-NUV due to recent star formation and candidate upturn cases. We use Lick indices to verify their similarity to redshift 0 upturn cases. RESULTS: We clearly detect a population of blue FUV-NUV BCGs in the redshift range 0.10-0.35, vastly improving the existing constraints at these epochs by increasing the number of galaxies studied, and by exploring a redshift range with no previous data (beyond 0.2), spanning one more Gyr in the past. These galaxies bring new constraints that can help distinguish between assumptions concerning the stellar populations causing the UV upturn phenomenon. The existence of a large number of UV upturns around redshift 0.25 favors the existence of a binary channel among the sources proposed in the literature.",18,[],1
1804.07704,astro-ph,"The debate in cosmology concerning LambdaCDM and MOND depends crucially on their respective ability of modelling across scales, and dealing with some of the specific problems that arise along the way. The main upshot of this article is to present three main problems facing multi-scale modelling in contemporary cosmology. The LambdaCDM model, which is the standard and by far most successful current cosmological model, faces what I call the downscaling problem when it comes to explain some recalcitrant evidence at the scale of individual galaxies, such as the mass-discrepancy acceleration relation (MDAR) and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTF). While the fastgrowing development of computer simulations has addressed these problems, nagging worries remain about some of the epistemic limits of these computer simulations in retrieving (as opposed to explaining) the data. The so-called upscaling problem affects MOND and its ability not just to explain but even simply retrieve large-scale structure and galaxy clusters. Recent attempts at extending MOND (EMOND) have had a limited empirical success, and are still far from providing a consistent explanation for possible formation mechanisms at the large-scale structure. Finally, the in between scales problem affects proposals designed to achieve the best of both worlds at the meso-scale. This is a fascinating area from a physical and a philosophical point of view, where the main challenge is the ability to have genuine predictive novelty.",18,[],1
1811.05796,astro-ph,"The gas metallicity of galaxies is often estimated using strong emission lines such as the optical lines of [OIII] and [OII]. The most common measure is ""R23"", defined as ([OII]equationequation3726, 3729  [OIII]equationequation4959,5007)/Hequation. Most calibrations for these strong-line metallicity indicators are for continuum selected galaxies. We report a new empirical calibration of R23 for extreme emission-line galaxies using a large sample of about 800 star-forming green pea galaxies with reliable Tequation-based gas-phase metallicity measurements. This sample is assembled from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 13 with the equivalent width of the line [OIII]equation5007 equation 300 \AA\ or the equivalent width of the line Hequation equation 100 \AA\ in the redshift range 0.011 equation z equation 0.411. For galaxies with strong emission lines and large ionization parameter (which manifests as log [OIII]equationequation4959,5007/[OII]equationequation3726,3729 equation 0.6), R23 monotonically increases with log(O/H) and the double-value degeneracy is broken. Our calibration provides metallicity estimates that are accurate to within equation 0.14 dex in this regime. Many previous R23 calibrations are found to have bias and large scatter for extreme emission-line galaxies. We give formulae and plots to directly convert R23 and [OIII]equationequation4959,5007/[OII]equationequation3726,3729 to log(O/H). Since green peas are best nearby analogs of high-redshift Lyman-equation emitting galaxies, the new calibration offers a good way to estimate the metallicities of both extreme emission-line galaxies and high-redshift Lyman-equation emitting galaxies. We also report on 15 galaxies with metallicities less than 1/12 solar, with the lowest metallicities being 12log(O/H) = 7.25 and 7.26.",18,[],1
1806.05867,astro-ph,"Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) is a basic physical process in fluids and magnetized plasmas, with applications successfully modelling e.g. exponentially growing instabilities observed at magnetospheric and heliospheric boundaries, in the solar or Earth's atmosphere and within astrophysical jets. Here, we report the discovery of the KHI in solar blowout jets and analyse the detailed evolution by employing high-resolution data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) satellite launched in 2013. The particular jet we focus on is rooted in the surrounding penumbra of the main negative polarity sunspot of Active Region 12365, where the main body of the jet is a super-penumbral structure. At its maximum, the jet has a length of 90 Mm, a width of 19.7 Mm, and its density is about 40 times higher than its surroundings. During the evolution of the jet, a cavity appears near the base of the jet, and bi-directional flows originated from the top and bottom of the cavity start to develop, indicating that magnetic reconnection takes place around the cavity. Two upward flows pass along the left boundary of the jet successively. Next, KHI develops due to a strong velocity shear (~ 204 km sequation) between these two flows, and subsequently the smooth left boundary exhibits a sawtooth pattern, evidencing the onset of the instability.",18,[],1
1803.03270,astro-ph,"Given rapid photodissociation and photodegradation, the recently discovered organics in the Martian subsurface and atmosphere were probably delivered in geologically recent times. Possible parent bodies are C-type asteroids, comets, and interplanetary dust particles (IDPs). The dust infall rate was estimated, using different methods, to be between equation and equation kg/yr (Nesvorny et al., 2011, Borin et al., 2017, Crismani et al., 2017); assuming a carbon content of 10% (Flynn, 1996), this implies an IDP carbon flux of equation kg/yr. We calculate for the first time the carbon flux from impacts of asteroids and comets. To this end, we perform dynamical simulations of impact rates on Mars. We use the N-body integrator RMVS/Swifter to propagate the Sun and the eight planets from their current positions. We separately add comets and asteroids to the simulations as massless test particles, based on their current orbital elements, yielding Mars impact rates of equation comets/Myr and 3.3 asteroids/Myr. We estimate the global carbon flux on Mars from cometary impacts to be equation~kg/yr within an order of magnitude, while asteroids deliver equation~kg/yr. These values correspond to equation and equation, respectively, of the IDP-borne carbon flux estimated by Nesvorny et al. 2011, Borin et al. 2017 and Crismani et al. 2017. Unlike the spatially homogeneous IDP infall, impact ejecta are distributed locally, concentrated around the impact site. We find organics from asteroids and comets to dominate over IDP-borne organics at distances up to 150~km from the crater center. Our results may be important for the interpretation of in situ detections of organics on Mars.",18,[],1

In this paper, we select a redMaPPer cluster sample in SDSS Stripe 82 region with equation, equation and equation. Using the high-quality weak lensing data from CS82 Survey, we constrain the mass profile of this sample. Then we compare directly the mass density profile with the satellite number density profile. We find that the total mass and number density profiles have the same shape, both well fitted by an NFW profile.

1811.10627,astro-ph,"Nuclear star clusters surrounding supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galactic nuclei contain large numbers of stars, black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs), a fraction of which are likely to form binaries. These binaries were suggested to form a triple system with the SMBH, which acts as a perturber and may enhance BH and NS mergers via the Lidov-Kozai mechanism. We follow-up previous studies, but for the first time perform an extensive statistical study of BH-BH, NS-NS and BH-NS binary mergers by means of direct high-precision regularized equation-body simulations, including Post-Newtonian (PN) terms up to order PN2.5. We consider different SMBH masses, slopes for the BH mass function, binary semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions, and different spatial distributions for the binaries. We find that the merger rates are a decreasing function of the SMBH mass and are in the ranges equation-equation, equation-equation and equation-equation for BH-BH, BH-NS and NS-NS binaries, respectively. However, the rate estimate from this channel remains highly uncertain and depends on the specific assumptions regarding the star-formation history in galactic nuclei and the supply rate of compact objects. We find that equation--equation of the mergers enter the LIGO band with eccentricities equation. We also compare our results to the secular approximation, and show that equation-body simulations generally predict a larger number of mergers. Finally, these events can also be observable via their electromagnetic counterparts, thus making these compact object mergers especially valuable for cosmological and astrophysical purposes.",18,[],1
1806.00185,astro-ph,"The most distant known quasar recently discovered by Ba\~nados et al. (2018) is at equation (690 Myr after the Big Bang), at the dawn of galaxy formation. We explore the host galaxy of the brightest quasar in the large volume cosmological hydrodynamic simulation BlueTides, which in Phase II has reached these redshifts. The brightest quasar in BlueTides has a luminosity of a equation few equation and a black hole mass of equation at equation, comparable to the observed quasar (the only one in this large volume). The quasar resides in a rare halo of mass equation and has a host galaxy of stellar mass of equation with an ongoing (intrinsic) star formation rate of equation. The corresponding intrinsic UV magnitude of the galaxy is equation, which is roughly equation magnitudes fainter than the quasar's magnitude of equation. We find that the galaxy is highly metal enriched with a mean metallicity equal to the solar value. We derive quasar and galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) in the mid and near infrared JWST bands. We predict a significant amount of dust attenuation in the rest-frame UV corresponding to equation giving an UV based SFR of equation. We present mock JWST images of the galaxy with and without central point source, in different MIRI and NIRCam filters. The host galaxy is detectable in NIRCam filters, but it is extremely compact (equation kpc). It will require JWST's exquisite sensitivity and resolution to separate the galaxy from the central point source.

1803.08588,astro-ph,"We suggest a new approach to search for galactic axions or other similar exotica. Streaming dark matter (DM) could have a better discovery potential because of flux enhancement, due to gravitational lensing when the Sun and/or a planet are aligned with a DM stream. Of interest are also axion miniclusters, in particular, if the solar system has trapped one during its formation. Wide-band axion antennae fit this concept, but also the proposed fast narrow band scanning. A network of detectors can provide full time coverage and a large axion mass acceptance. Other DM searches may profit from this proposal.",18,[],1
1810.02388,astro-ph,"We present an analysis of VI CCD time-series photometry of the globular cluster NGC 6171. The main goal is to determine individual physical parameters for single-mode RR Lyrae stars present in the field of view of our images, by means of light curve Fourier decomposition and well-established calibrations and zero-points. This leads to the estimation of the mean values of the metallicity and distance for the parental cluster. From the RRab stars we find [Fe/H]ZW = -1.33 - 0.12 and a distance d = 5.3 - 0.3 kpc and from the RRc stars we find [Fe/H]ZW = -1.02 - 0.19 and a distance d = 5.3 - 0.2 kpc. Independent methods, such as the P-L relations for RRab and SX Phe stars enable the estimation of a weighted average distance to the cluster of 5.4 - 0.1 kpc. We confirm the amplitude modulations of the Blazhko type of five RRab and the non-membership of V21 to the cluster. The colour-magnitude diagram is consistent with an age of 11 Gyrs. The distribution of RRab and RRc stars seems well segregated around the first overtone red edge of the instability strip. This positions NGC 6171 among OoI type clusters where the pulsating modes are neatly separated in the HB. We report two new irregular variables of the Lb type.",18,[],1
1809.04858,astro-ph,"Theoretical models of galaxy formation suggest that the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) is required to regulate the growth of its host galaxy through feedback mechanisms, produced by e.g. AGN-driven outflows. Although such outflows are common both at low and high redshift, a comprehensive picture is still missing. The peak epoch of galaxy assembly (1<z<3) has been poorly explored so far, and current observations in this redshift range are mostly limited to targets with high chances to be in an outflowing phase. This paper introduces SUPER (a SINFONI Survey for Unveiling the Physics and Effect of Radiative feedback), an ongoing ESO's VLT/SINFONI Large Programme. SUPER will perform the first systematic investigation of ionized outflows in a sizeable and blindly-selected sample of 39 X-ray AGN at z~2, which reaches high spatial resolutions (~2 kpc) thanks to the adaptive optics-assisted IFU observations. The outflow morphology and star formation in the host galaxy will be mapped through the broad component of [OIII] and the narrow component of Ha emission lines. The main aim of our survey is to infer the impact of outflows on the on-going star formation and to link the outflow properties to a number of AGN and host galaxy properties. We describe here the survey characteristics and goals, as well as the selection of the target sample. Moreover, we present a full characterization of its multi-wavelength properties: we measure, via spectral energy distribution fitting of UV-to-FIR photometry, stellar masses (4x109-2x1011 Msun), star formation rates (25-680 Msun yr-1) and AGN bolometric luminosities (2x1044-8x1047 erg s-1), along with obscuring column densities (<2x1024 cm-2) and 2-10 keV luminosities (2x1043-6x1045 erg s-1) derived through X-ray spectral analysis.

1811.02677,astro-ph,"Kuiper belt object (KBO) Eris is exceptionally bright with a greater visible geometric albedo than any other known KBO. Its infrared reflectance spectrum is dominated by methane, which should form tholins that darken the surface on timescales much shorter than the age of the Solar System. Thus one or more ongoing processes probably maintain its brightness. Eris is predicted to have a primarily nitrogen atmosphere that is in vapor pressure equilibrium with nitrogen-ice and is collisional (not ballistic). Eris's eccentric orbit is expected to result in two atmospheric regimes: (1) a period near perihelion when the atmosphere is global (analogous to the atmospheres of Mars, Triton, and Pluto) and (2) a period near aphelion when only a local atmosphere exists near the warmest region (analogous to the atmosphere of Io). A numerical model developed to simulate Eris's thermal and volatile evolution in the local atmosphere regime is presented. The model conserves energy, mass, and momentum while maintaining vapor pressure equilibrium. It is adaptable to other local, collisional, sublimation atmospheres, which in addition to Io and Eris, may occur on several volatile-bearing KBOs. The model was applied for a limiting case where Eris is fixed at aphelion and has an initial nitrogen-ice mass everywhere equal to the precipitable column of nitrogen in Pluto's atmosphere during the New Horizons encounter (the resultant mass if the Pluto atmosphere collapsed uniformly onto the surface). The model results indicate that (1) transport of nitrogen in the local, collisional, sublimation atmosphere regime is significant, (2) changes of Eris's albedo or color from nitrogen transport may be observable, and (3) uniform collapse of a global, nitrogen atmosphere likely cannot explain Eris's anomalous albedo in the present epoch.

1809.10042,astro-ph,"This paper focuses on two-planet systems in a first-order equation mean motion resonance and undergoing type-I migration in a disc. We present a detailed analysis of the resonance valid for any value of equation. Expressions for the equilibrium eccentricities, mean motions and departure from exact resonance are derived in the case of smooth convergent migration. We show that this departure, not assumed to be small, is such that period ratio normally exceeds, but can also be less than, equation Departure from exact resonance as a function of time for systems starting in resonance and undergoing divergent migration is also calculated. We discuss observed systems in which two low mass planets are close to a first-order resonance. We argue that the data are consistent with only a small fraction of the systems having been captured in resonance. Furthermore, when capture does happen, it is not in general during smooth convergent migration through the disc but after the planets reach the disc inner parts. We show that although resonances may be disrupted when the inner planet enters a central cavity, this alone cannot explain the spread of observed separations. Disruption is found to result in either the system moving interior to the resonance by a few percent, or attaining another resonance. We postulate two populations of low mass planets: a small one for which extensive smooth migration has occurred, and a larger one that formed approximately in-situ with very limited migration.",18,[],1

We study white dwarfs with surface magnetic fields from equation to equation~G and masses from equation to equation and analyze the behavior of the white dwarf parameters such as moment of inertia, angular momentum, central temperature and magnetic field intensity as a function of lifetime.

1804.00869,astro-ph,"We need to establish a correspondence between the magnetic structures generated by models and usual stellar activity indexes to simulate radial velocity time series for stars less active than the Sun. This is necessary to compare the outputs of such models with observed radial velocity jitters and is critical to better understand the impact of stellar activity on exoplanet detectability. We propose a coherent picture to describe the relationship between magnetic activity, including the quiet Sun regions, and the chromospheric emission using the Sun as a test-bench and a reference. We analyzed a time series of MDI magnetograms jointly with chromospheric emission time series obtained at Sacramento Peak and Kitt Peak observatories. This has allowed us to study the variability in the quiet Sun over the solar cycle, and then, based on available relations between magnetic fields in active structures and chromospheric emission, to propose an empirical reconstruction of the solar chromospheric emission based on all contributions. We show that the magnetic flux covering the solar surface, including in the quieted regions, varies in phase with the solar cycle, suggesting a long-term relationship between the global dynamo and the contribution of all components of solar activity. We have been able to propose a reconstruction of the solar S-index, including a relationship between the weak field component and its chomospheric emission, which is in good agreement with the literature. This allows us to explain that stars with a low average chromospheric emission level exhibit a low variability. We conclude that weak flux regions significantly contribute to the chromospheric emission; these regions should be critical in explaining the lower variability associated with the lower average activity level in other stars as compared to the Sun and estimated from their chromospheric emission.",18,[],1

We search forthe associated Sausage Globular Clusters by analysing the structure of 91 Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) in action space using the Gaia Data Release 2 catalogue, complemented with Hubble Space Telescope proper motions. There is a characteristic energy equation which separates the in situ objects, such as the bulge/disc clusters, from the accreted objects, such as the young halo clusters.

Eight of the high energy, old halo GCs are strongly clumped in azimuthal and vertical action, yet strung out like beads on a chain at extreme radial action. They are very radially anisotropic (equation) and move on orbits that are all highly eccentric (equation).

1808.05929,astro-ph,"Previous findings show that the existence of dense cores or bulges is the prerequisite for quenching a galaxy, leading to a proposed two-step quenching scenario: compaction and quenching. In this scenario, galaxies first grow their cores to a stellar mass surface density threshold and subsequently quenching occurs, suggesting that galaxies evolve from extended star-forming galaxies (eSFGs), through compact star-forming galaxies (cSFGs), to quenched population. In this work, we aim at examining the possible evolutionary link between eSFGs and cSFGs by identifying the trends in star formation rate (SFR), gas-phase metallicity and HI content, since one would naturally expect that galaxies evolve along the track of cold gas consumption and metal enhancement. We select a volume-limited sample of 15,933 galaxies with stellar mass above equation and redshift of 0.02 < z < 0.05 from the NASA-Sloan-Atlas catalog within the ALFALFA footprint. The cSFGs on average exhibit similar or slightly higher SFRs of equation0.06 dex and significantly higher gas-phase metallicity (up to 0.2 dex at low mass) with respect to the eSFGs, while the cSFGs dominate the galaxy population of the most intense star formation activities. More importantly, overall the median HI content and gas depletion time of cSFGs are about half of eSFGs. Our result supports the compaction and quenching scenario that galaxies evolve and grow their cores along the track of cold gas consumption and metal enhancement. The environments of eSFGs and cSFGs are indistinguishable, suggesting that the compaction process is independent of any environmental effects at least for low-redshift universe.",18,[],1
1810.04241,astro-ph,"The relative abundance of deuterium and hydrogen is a potent tracer of planet formation and evolution. Jupiter and Saturn have protosolar atmospheric D/H ratios, a relic of substantial gas accretion from the nebula, while the atmospheres of Neptune and Uranus are enhanced in D by accretion of ices into their envelopes. For terrestrial planets, D/H ratios are used to determine the mechanisms of volatile delivery and subsequent atmosphere loss over the lifetime of the planet. Planets and brown dwarfs more massive than 13 MJ quickly fuse their initial D reservoir. Here, we simulate spectra for giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs (2 MNeptune to ~10 MJupiter) from Teff=200--1800 K including both CH3D and HDO to determine the observability of these dominant deuterium isotopologues in mid-infrared thermal emission spectra. Colder objects have stronger molecular features in their spectra, due to the temperature-dependence of molecular cross sections. CH3D is easier to observe than HDO at all temperatures considered, due to the strength of its absorption bands and locations of features at wavelengths with few other strong absorption features. We predict that for nearby cool brown dwarfs, the CH3D abundance can be measured at high signal-to-noise with the James Webb Space Telescope; for objects from 200--800 K closer than 10 pc, a protosolar D/H ratio would be readily observable in 2.5 hours. Moderately young Jupiter-mass planets (100--300 Myr) and young Neptunes (10 Myr) may be discovered with JWST and provide the best targets for detecting deuterium on an exoplanet in the coming decade.

1804.06199,astro-ph,"We present and discuss the orbital content of a rather unusual rotating barred galaxy model, in which the three-dimensional (3D) family, bifurcating from x1 at the 2:1 vertical resonance with the known ""frown-smile"" side-on morphology, is unstable. Our goal is to study the differences that occur in the phase space structure at the vertical 2:1 resonance region in this case, with respect to the known, well studied, standard case, in which the families with the frown-smile profiles are stable and support an X-shaped morphology. The potential used in the study originates in a frozen snapshot of an equation-body simulation in which a fast bar has evolved. We follow the evolution of the vertical stability of the central family of periodic orbits as a function of the energy (Jacobi constant) and we investigate the phase space content by means of spaces of section. The two bifurcating families at the vertical 2:1 resonance region of the new model change their stability with respect to that of most studied analytic potentials. The structure in the side-on view that is directly supported by the trapping of quasi-periodic orbits around 3D stable periodic orbits has now an infinity symbol (i.e. equation-type) profile. However, the available sticky orbits can reinforce other types of side-on morphologies as well. In the new model, the dynamical mechanism of trapping quasi-periodic orbits around the 3D stable periodic orbits that build the peanut, supports the equation-type profile. The same mechanism in the standard case supports the X shape with the frown-smile orbits. Nevertheless, in both cases (i.e. in the new and in the standard model) a combination of 3D quasi-periodic orbits around the stable x1 family with sticky orbits can support a profile reminiscent of the shape of the orbits of the 3D unstable family existing in each model.",18,[],1
1810.06572,astro-ph,"We have investigated the jet-linked \mboxX-ray emission from highly radio-loud quasars (HRLQs; equation) at high redshift. We studied the X-ray properties of 15 HRLQs at equation, using new \it Chandra observations for six objects and archival \it XMM-Newton and \it Swift observations for the other nine. We focused on testing the apparent enhancement of jet-linked \mboxX-ray emission from HRLQs at equation. Utilizing an enlarged (24 objects) optically flux-limited sample with complete X-ray coverage, we confirmed that HRLQs at equation have enhanced X-ray emission relative to that of HRLQs at equation 1--2 with matched UV/optical and radio luminosity, at a \mbox4.0--4.6~equation level; the X-ray enhancements are confirmed considering both two-point spectral indices and inspection of broad-band spectral energy distributions. The typical factor of enhancement is revised to equation, which is smaller than but consistent with previous results. A fractional IC/CMB model can still explain our results at high redshift, which puts tighter constraints on the fraction of IC/CMB X-rays at lower redshifts, assuming the physical properties of quasar jets do not have a strong redshift dependence. A dominant IC/CMB model is inconsistent with our data.",18,[],1

1805.08682,astro-ph,"The Cassini spacecraft revealed the spectacular, highly irregular shapes of the small inner moons of Saturn, ranging from the unique ""ravioli-like"" forms of Pan and Atlas to the highly elongated structure of Prometheus. Closest to Saturn, these bodies provide important clues regarding the formation process of small moons in close orbits around their host planet, but their range of irregular shapes has not been explained yet. Here we show that the spectrum of shapes among Saturn's small moons is a natural outcome of merging collisions among similar-sized moonlets possessing physical properties and orbits that are consistent with those of the current moons. A significant fraction of such merging collisions take place either at the first encounter or after 1-2 hit-and-run events, with impact velocities in the range of 1-5 times the mutual escape velocity. Close to head-on mergers result in flattened objects with large equatorial ridges, as observed on Atlas and Pan. With slightly more oblique impact angles, collisions lead to elongated, Prometheus-like shapes. These results suggest that the current forms of the small moons provide direct evidence of the processes at the final stages of their formation, involving pairwise encounters of moonlets of comparable size. Finally, we show that this mechanism may also explain the formation of Iapetus' equatorial ridge, as well as its oblate shape.",18,[],1

1802.05665,astro-ph,"High-precision pulsar timing is central to a wide range of astrophysics and fundamental physics applications. When timing an ensemble of millisecond pulsars in different sky positions, known as a pulsar timing array (PTA), one can search for ultra-low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) through the spatial correlations that spacetime deformations by passing GWs are predicted to induce on the pulses' times-of-arrival (TOAs). A pulsar-timing model, requires the use of a solar-system ephemeris (SSE) to properly predict the position of the solar-system barycentre, the (quasi-)inertial frame where all TOAs are referred. Here, I discuss how while errors in SSEs can introduce correlations in the TOAs that may interfere with GW searches, one can make use of PTAs to study the solar system. I discuss work done within the context of the European Pulsar Timing Array and the International Pulsar Timing Array collaborations. These include new updates on the masses of planets from PTA data, first limits on masses of the most massive asteroids, and comparisons between SSEs from independent groups. Finally, I discuss a new approach in setting limits on the masses of unknown bodies in the solar system and calculate mass sensitivity curves for PTA data.",18,[],1
1808.10546,astro-ph,"Faraday tomography is thought to be a powerful tool to explore cosmic magnetic field. Broadband radio polarimetric data is essential to ensure the quality of Faraday tomography, but such data is not easy to obtain because of radio frequency interferences (RFIs). In this paper, we investigate optimum frequency coverage of Faraday tomography so as to explore Faraday rotation measure (RM) due to the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) in filaments of galaxies. We adopt a simple model of the IGMF and estimate confidence intervals of the model parameters using the Fisher information matrix. We find that meaningful constraints for RM due to the IGMF are available with data at multiple narrowbands which are scattered over the ultra-high frequency (UHF, 300 MHz - 3000 MHz). The optimum frequency depends on the Faraday thickness of the Milky Way foreground. These results are obtained for a wide brightness range of the background source including fast radio bursts (FRBs). We discuss the relation between the polarized-intensity spectrum and the optimum frequency.",18,[],1
1812.05113,astro-ph,"The treatment of unknown foreground contaminations will be one of the major challenges for galaxy clustering analyses of coming decadal surveys. These data contaminations introduce erroneous large-scale effects in recovered power spectra and inferred dark matter density fields. In this work, we present an effective solution to this problem in the form of a robust likelihood designed to account for effects due to unknown foreground and target contaminations. Conceptually, this robust likelihood marginalizes over the unknown large-scale contamination amplitudes. We showcase the effectiveness of this novel likelihood via an application to a mock SDSS-III data set subject to dust extinction contamination. In order to illustrate the performance of our proposed likelihood, we infer the underlying dark-matter density field and reconstruct the matter power spectrum, being maximally agnostic about the foregrounds. The results are compared to those of an analysis with a standard Poissonian likelihood, as typically used in modern large-scale structure analyses. While the standard Poissonian analysis yields excessive power for large-scale modes and introduces an overall bias in the power spectrum, our likelihood provides unbiased estimates of the matter power spectrum over the entire range of Fourier modes considered in this work. Further, we demonstrate that our approach accurately accounts for and corrects the effects of unknown foreground contaminations when inferring three-dimensional density fields. Robust likelihood approaches, as presented in this work, will be crucial to control unknown systematic error and maximize the outcome of the decadal surveys.",18,[],1
1812.05135,astro-ph,"Redshift is not a shift, it is defined as a fractional change in wavelength. Nevertheless, it is a fairly common misconception that Delta-z c represents a velocity where Delta-z is the redshift separation between two galaxies. When evaluating large changes in a quantity, it is often more useful to consider logarithmic differences. Defining zeta = ln lambdaobs - ln lambdaem results in a more accurate approximation for line-of-sight velocity and, more importantly, this means that the cosmological and peculiar velocity terms become additive: Delta-zeta c can represent a velocity at any cosmological distance. Logarithmic shift zeta, or equivalently ln(1z), should arguably be used for photometric redshift evaluation. For a comparative non-accelerating universe, used in cosmology, comoving distance is proportional to zeta. This means that galaxy population distributions in zeta, rather than z, are close to being evenly distributed in comoving distance, and they have a more aesthetic spacing when considering galaxy evolution. Some pedagogic notes on these quantities are presented.",18,[],1

1807.01690,astro-ph,"We report on laboratory test results of the Compact Water Vapor Radiometer (CWVR) prototype for the NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), a five-channel design centered around the 22 GHz water vapor line. Fluctuations in precipitable water vapor cause fluctuations in atmospheric brightness emission, which are assumed to be proportional to phase fluctuations of the astronomical signal seen by an antenna. Water vapor radiometry consists of using a radiometer to measure variations in the atmospheric brightness emission to correct for the phase fluctuations. The CWVR channel isolation requirement of < -20 dB is met, indicating < 1% power leakage between any two channels. Gain stability tests indicate that Channel 1 needs repair, and that the fluctuations in output counts for Channel 2 to 5 are negatively correlated to the CWVR enclosure ambient temperature, with a change of ~ 405 counts per 1 degree C change in temperature. With temperature correction, the single channel and channel difference gain stability is < 2 x 10-4, and the observable gain stability is < 2.5 x 10-4 over t = 2.5 - 103 sec, all of which meet the requirements. Overall, the test results indicate that the CWVR meets specifications for dynamic range, channel isolation, and gain stability to be tested on an antenna. Future work consists of building more CWVRs and testing the phase correlations on the VLA antennas to evaluate the use of WVR for not only the VLA, but also the Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA).",18,[],1
1802.01667,astro-ph,"Based on an initial expectation from laboratory measurements or instrument simulations, photometric passbands are usually subject to refinements. These refinements use photometric observations of astronomical sources with known spectral energy distribution. This work investigates the methods for and limitations in determining passbands from photometric observations. A simple general formalism for passband determinations from photometric measurements is derived. The results are applied to the passbands of HIPPARCOS, Tycho, and Gaia DR1. The problem of passband determination is formulated in a basic functional analytic framework. For the solution of the resulting equations, functional principal component analysis is applied. We find that, given a set of calibration sources, the passband can be described with respect to the set of calibration sources as the sum of two functions, one which is uniquely determined by the set of calibration sources, and one which is entirely unconstrained. The constrained components for the HIPPARCOS, Tycho, and Gaia DR1 passbands are determined, and the unconstrained components are estimated.",18,[],1
1808.06794,astro-ph,"Earlier studies on Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), using remote sensing and in situ observations, have attempted to determine some of the internal properties of CMEs, which were limited to a certain position or a certain time. For understanding the evolution of the internal thermodynamic state of CMEs during their heliospheric propagation, we improve the self-similar flux rope internal state (FRIS) model, which is constrained by measured propagation and expansion speed profiles of a CME. We implement the model to a CME erupted on 2008 December 12 and probe the internal state of the CME. It is found that the polytropic index of the CME plasma decreased continuously from 1.8 to 1.35 as the CME moved away from the Sun, implying that the CME released heat before it reached adiabatic state and then absorbed heat. We further estimate the entropy changing and heating rate of the CME. We also find that the thermal force inside the CME is the internal driver of CME expansion while Lorentz force prevented the CME from expanding. It is noted that centrifugal force due to poloidal motion decreased with the fastest rate and Lorentz force decreased slightly faster than thermal pressure force as CME moved away from the Sun. We also discuss the limitations of the model and approximations made in the study.",18,[],1
1810.03795,astro-ph,"We investigate the formation and magnetic topology of four flare/CME events with filament-sigmoid systems, in which the sigmoidal hot channels are located above the filaments, and they appear in pairs prior to eruption. The formation of hot channels usually takes several to dozens of hours during which two J-shape sheared arcades gradually evolve into sigmoidal hot channels, then they keep stable for tens of minutes or hours and erupt. While the low-lying filaments show no significant change. \textbfWe construct a series of magnetic field models and find that the best-fit preflare models contain magnetic flux ropes with hyperbolic flux tubes (HFTs). The field lines above the HFT correspond to the high-lying hot channel, while those below the HFT surround the underlying filaments. In particular, the continuous and long field lines representing the flux rope located above the HFT match the observed hot channels well in three events. While for SOL2014-04-18 event, the flux bundle that mimics the observed hot channel is located above the flux rope. The flux rope axis lies in a height range of 19.8 Mm and 46 Mm above the photosphere for the four events, among which the flux rope axis in SOL2012-07-12 event has a maximum height, which probably explains why it is often considered as a double-decker structure.

Here we present followup observations to the original discovery and characterization of this ""changing look"" active galactic nucleus (AGN). The new Chandra and HST observations from 2014 show that Mrk 590 is awakening, changing its appearance again. While the source continues to be in a low state, its soft excess has re-emerged, though not to the previous level. The UV continuum is brighter by more than a factor of two and the broad MgII emission line is present, indicating that the ionizing continuum is also brightening. These observations suggest that the soft excess is not due to reprocessed hard X-ray emission. Instead, it is connected to the UV continuum through warm Comptonization. Variability of the Fe K-alpha emission lines suggests that the reprocessing region is within about 10 light years or 3 pc of the central source.

1812.07285,astro-ph,"Multi-wavelength ultraviolet (UV) observations by the IRIS satellite in active region NOAA 12529 have recently pointed out the presence of long-lasting brightenings, akin to UV bursts, and simultaneous plasma ejections occurring in the upper chromosphere and transition region during secondary flux emergence. These signatures have been interpreted as evidence of small-scale, recurrent magnetic reconnection episodes between the emerging flux region (EFR) and the pre-existing plage field. Here, we characterize the UV emission of these strong, intermittent brightenings and we study the surge activity above the chromospheric arch filament system (AFS) overlying the EFR. We analyze the surges and the cospatial brightenings observed at different wavelengths. We find an asymmetry in the emission between the blue and red wings of the Si IV 1402 \AA and Mg II k 2796.3 \AA lines, which clearly outlines the dynamics of the structures above the AFS that form during the small-scale eruptive phenomena. We also detect a correlation between the Doppler velocity and skewness of the Si IV 1394 \AA and 1402 \AA line profiles in the UV burst pixels.

We present results from a detailed analysis of an unpublished archival observation using XMM-Newton EPIC pn and MOS data in a quiescent state of XY Ari.

The broad orbital modulation observed with various observations was confirmed with XMM-Newton at hard X-ray (>1.6 keV). The EPIC light curves folded at the spin phases show a double peak profile as expected from two pole accretion. The pulse profile is found to be energy dependent. Hardness ratio variations and energy modulation depth during spin modulation can be explained by photoelectric absorption. The simultaneously fitted EPIC spectra with CEVMKL model yield maximum plasma temperature of equation keV with an iron abundance equation. We find two intrinsic partial covering absorption columns of equation and equation with covering fractions of equation, equation respectively.

We also detected the pulsar-wind nebula (PWN) in the NUV-MAMA image, with a morphology similar to that observed in the optical and near-infrared (IR). The extinction-corrected NUV and FUV pulsar fluxes are compatible with a very steep power law spectrum equation with spectral index equation, non compatible with a Rayleigh Jeans spectrum, indicating a non-thermal origin of the emission. The comparison with the optical/near-IR power-law spectrum (spectral index equation), indicates an abrupt turn-off at wavelengths below 2500 \AA, not observed in other pulsars. We detected pulsations in both the NUV and FUV data at the 50 ms pulsar period. In both cases, the pulse profile features two peaks closely spaced in phase, as observed in the optical and X-ray light curves. The NUV/FUV peaks are also aligned in phase with those observed in the radio (1.4 GHz), optical, X, and equation-ray light curves, like in the Crab pulsar, implying a similar beaming geometry across all wavelengths.

1804.06150,astro-ph,"For decades the limited thickness of Vesta's basaltic crust, revealed by the link between the asteroid and the howardite-eucrite-diogenite family of meteorites, and its survival to collisional erosion offered an important constraint for the study of the early evolution of the Solar System. Some results of the Dawn mission, however, cast doubts on our understanding of Vesta's interior composition and of the characteristics of its basaltic crust, weakening this classical constraint. In this work we investigate the late accretion and erosion experienced by Vesta's crust after its differentiation and recorded in the composition of eucrites and diogenites and show that it offers an astrochemical window into the earliest evolution of the Solar System. In our proof-of-concept case study focusing on the late accretion and erosion of Vesta's crust during the growth and migration of Jupiter, the water enrichment of eucrites appears to be a sensitive function of Jupiter's migration while the enrichment in highly-siderophile elements of diogenites appears to be particularly sensitive to the size-frequency distribution of the planetesimals. The picture depicted by the enrichments created by late accretion in eucrites and diogenites is not qualitatively affected by the uncertainty on the primordial mass of Vesta. Crustal erosion, instead, is more significantly affected by said uncertainty and Vesta's crust survival appears to be mainly useful to study violent collisional scenarios where highly energetic impacts can strip significant amounts of vestan material while limitedly contributing to Vesta's late accretion. Our results suggest that the astrochemical record of the late accretion and erosion of Vesta's crust provided by eucrites and diogenites can be used as a tool to investigate any process or scenario associated to the evolution of primordial Vesta and of the early Solar System.",18,[],1
1808.06426,astro-ph,"To understand the physics of sunspots, it is important to know the properties of their magnetic field, and especially its height stratification plays a substantial role. There are mainly two methods to assess this stratification, but they yield different magnetic gradients in the photospheric layers. Determinations based on the different origin of several spectral lines and the slope of their profiles result in gradients of -2 to -3G/km, or even steeper. This is similar for the total magnetic field strength and for the vertical component of the magnetic field. The other option is to determine the horizontal partial derivatives of the magnetic field, and with the condition divB=0, also the vertical derivative is known. With this method, gradients of -0.5 G/km and shallower are obtained. Obviously, these results do not agree. If chromospheric spectral lines are included, only shallow gradients around -0.5G/km are encountered. Shallow gradients are also found from gyro-resonance measurements in the radio wave range 300 - 2000GHz. Some indirect methods are also considered, but they cannot clarify the total picture. An analysis of a numerical simulation of a sunspot indicates a shallow gradient over a wide height range, but with slightly steeper gradients in deep layers. Several ideas to explain the discrepancy are also discussed. With no doubts cast on Maxwell's equations, the first one is to look at the uncertainties of the formation heights of spectral lines, but a wider range of these heights would require an extension of the solar photosphere that is incompatible with observations and the theory of stellar atmospheres. The problem of the height gradient of the magnetic field in sunspots is still not solved.",18,[],1

Our study aims to characterize the physical and orbital properties of HD95086b, search for additional planets at short and wide orbits and image the cold outer debris belt in scattered light. We used HARPS at the ESO 3.6m telescope to monitor the radial velocity of HD95086 over 2 years and investigate the existence of giant planets at less than 3au orbital distance. With the IRDIS dual-band imager and the IFS integral field spectrograph of SPHERE at VLT, we imaged the faint circumstellar environment beyond 10au at six epochs between 2015 and 2017. We do not detect additional giant planets around HD95086. We identified the nature (bound companion or background contaminant) of all point-like sources detected in the IRDIS field of view. None of them correspond to the ones recently discovered near the edge of the cold outer belt by ALMA. HD95086b is resolved for the first time in J-band with IFS. Its near-infrared spectral energy distribution is well fitted by a few dusty and/or young L7-L9 dwarf spectral templates. The extremely red 1-4um spectral distribution is typical of low-gravity objects at the L/T spectral type transition. The planet's orbital motion is resolved between January 2015 and May 2017. Together with past NaCo measurements properly re-calibrated, our orbital fitting solutions favor a retrograde low to moderate-eccentricity orbit e=0.2 (0.0 to 0.5), with a semi-major axis 52au corresponding to orbital periods of 288$ yrs and an inclination that peaks at i = 141deg, which is compatible with a planet-disk coplanar configuration.

1812.02499,astro-ph,"We investigate the stellar populations of galaxies in clusters at different dynamical stages, aiming to identify possible effects of the relaxation state of the cluster or subcluster on the star formation histories of its galaxies. We have developed and applied a code for kinematic substructure detection to a sample of 412 galaxy clusters drawn from the \citet[]tempel2012 catalogue, finding a frequency of substructures of 45\%. We have extracted mean stellar ages with the \scstarlight spectral synthesis code applied to SDSS-III spectra of the sample galaxies. We found lower mean stellar ages in unrelaxed clusters relative to relaxed clusters. For unrelaxed clusters, we separated primary and secondary subhalos and found that, while relaxed clusters and primaries present similar masses and age distributions, secondaries present younger stellar populations, mainly due to low-mass galaxies (equation\,dex). An age-clustercentric radius relation is seen for all subhalos irrespective of the presence of substructures. We also observe relations between the mean stellar age and mass of relaxed and unrelaxed clusters, massive systems presenting higher mean ages. The locus of these relations is distinct between relaxed and unrelaxed clusters, but become indistinguishable when separating primaries and secondaries. Our results suggest that differences between relaxed and unrelaxed clusters are mainly driven by low-mass systems in the clusters outskirts, and that, while pre-processing can be seen in the subcomponents of dynamically young clusters, some evolution in the stellar populations must occur during the clusters relaxation.",18,[],1
1804.06841,astro-ph,"Short-period binary star systems dissipate orbital energy through tidal interactions that lead to tighter, more circular orbits. When at least one star in a binary has evolved off of the main sequence, orbital circularization occurs for longer-period (~100 day) systems. Past work by (Verbunt & Phinney 1995) has shown that the orbital parameters and the circularization periods of a small sample of binary stars with evolved-star members can be understood within the context of standard tidal circularization theory. Using a sample of binaries with subgiant, giant, and red clump star members that is nearly an order of magnitude larger, we reexamine predictions for tidal circularization of binary stars with evolved members. We confirm that systems predicted by equilibrium-tide theory to have circular orbits generally have negligible measured eccentricities. The circularization period is correlated with the surface gravity (i.e. size) of the evolved member, indicating that the circularization timescale must be shorter than the evolutionary timescale along the giant branch. A few exceptions to the conclusions above are mentioned in the discussion: Some of these exceptions are likely systems in which the spectrum of the secondary biases the radial velocity measurements, but four appear to be genuine, short-period, moderate-eccentricity systems.",18,[],1

1802.04043,astro-ph,"By analysing a sample of galaxies selected from the HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS) to contain more than 2.5 times their expected HI content based on their optical properties, we investigate what drives these HI eXtreme (HIX) galaxies to be so HI-rich. We model the HI kinematics with the Tilted Ring Fitting Code TiRiFiC and compare the observed HIX galaxies to a control sample of galaxies from HIPASS as well as simulated galaxies built with the semi-analytic model Dark Sage. We find that (1) HI discs in HIX galaxies are more likely to be warped and more likely to host HI arms and tails than in the control galaxies, (2) the average HI and average stellar column density of HIX galaxies is comparable to the control sample, (3) HIX galaxies have higher HI and baryonic specific angular momenta than control galaxies, (4) most HIX galaxies live in higher-spin haloes than most control galaxies. These results suggest that HIX galaxies are HI-rich because they can support more HI against gravitational instability due to their high specific angular momentum. The majority of the HIX galaxies inherits their high specific angular momentum from their halo. The HI content of HIX galaxies might be further increased by gas-rich minor mergers.

1808.09872,astro-ph,"Constraining the planetary composition is essential for exoplanetary characterization. In this paper, we use a statistical analysis to determine the characteristic maximum (threshold) radii for various compositions for exoplanets with masses up to 25 Earth masses (Mequation). We confirm that most planets with radii larger than 1.6 Earth radius (Requation) are not rocky, and must consist of lighter elements, as found by previous studies. We find that planets with radii above 2.6 Requation cannot be pure-water worlds, and must contain significant amounts of hydrogen and helium (H-He). We find that planets with radii larger than about 3 Requation, 3.6 Requation, and 4.3 Requation are expected to consist of 2%, 5% and 10% of H-He, respectively. We investigate the sensitivity of the results to the assumed internal structure, the planetary temperature and albedo, and the accuracy of the mass and radius determination. We show that the envelope's metallicity, the percentage of H-He and the distribution of the elements play a significant role in the determination of the threshold radius. Finally, we conclude that despite the degenerate nature of the problem, it is possible to put limits on the possible range of compositions for planets with well-measured mass and radius.",18,[],1
1811.06536,astro-ph,Tidal interactions between planets or stars and the bodies that orbit them dissipate energy in their interiors.

1811.06547,astro-ph,"The conversion factor equation from the observable CO(1-0) luminosity to the mass of molecular gas is known to vary between isolated galaxies and some mergers, but the underlying reasons are not clearly understood. Thus, the value(s) of equation to be adopted remain highly uncertain. To provide better constraints, we apply the large velocity gradient method to a series of hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies and derive the evolution of equation. We report significant variations of equation, and identify three distinct regimes: disk galaxies, starbursts and post-burst phases. We show that estimating the star formation rate over 20 Myr smooths out some of these differences, but still maintains a distinction between disks and starbursts. We find a tighter correlation of equation with the gas depletion time than with star formation rate, yet with deviations induced by the transitions to and from the starburst episodes. We conclude that equation fluctuates because of both the feedback energy and the velocity dispersion. Identifying the phase of an interaction by classical means (e.g. morphology, luminosity) could then help selecting the relevant conversion factor to be used and get more accurate estimates of the molecular masses of galaxies.",18,[],1
1804.01869,astro-ph,"Kepler-419 is a planetary system discovered by the Kepler photometry which is known to harbour two massive giant planets: [...] Here we present new radial velocity (RV) measurements secured over more than two years with the SOPHIE spectrograph, where both planets are clearly detected. The RV data is modelled together with the Kepler photometry using a photodynamical model. The inclusion of velocity information breaks the equation degeneracy inherent in timing data alone, allowing us to measure the absolute stellar and planetary radii and masses. With uncertainties of 12% and 13% for the stellar and inner planet radii, and 35%, 24%, and 35% for the masses of the star, planet b, and planet c respectively, these measurements are the most precise to date for a single host star system using this technique. The transiting planet mass is determined at better precision than the star mass. This shows that modelling the radial velocities and the light curve together in systems of dynamically interacting planets provides a way of characterising both the star and the planets without being limited by knowledge of the star. On the other hand, the period ratio and eccentricities place the Kepler-419 system in a sweet spot; had around twice as many transits been observed, the mass of the transiting planet could have been measured using its own TTVs. Finally, the origin of the Kepler-419 system is discussed. We show that the system is near a coplanar high-eccentricity secular fixed point, related to the alignment of the orbits, which has prevented the inner orbit from circularising. For most other relative apsidal orientations, planet b's orbit would be circular with a semi-major axis of 0.03 au. This suggests a mechanism for forming hot Jupiters in multiplanetary systems without the need of high mutual inclinations.",18,[],1

We also observed the (V-Rc) colour index reddening as the star faded suggesting emission detectable in the Rc-band but beyond our spectral response. We confirm that the circumstellar reddening of RR Tau is consistent with an extinction ratio Rv = 5 and that its spectral type is close to A0.

Here we present the current design of the large aperture telescope receiver (LATR), a 2.4 m diameter cryostat that will be mounted on the SO 6 m telescope and will be the largest CMB receiver to date. The cryostat size was chosen to take advantage of the large focal plane area having high Strehl ratios, which is inherent to the Cross-Dragone telescope design. The LATR will be able to accommodate thirteen optics tubes, each having a 36 cm diameter aperture and illuminating several thousand transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers. This set of equipment will provide an opportunity to make measurements with unparalleled sensitivity. However, the size and complexity of the LATR also pose numerous technical challenges.

The solutions we develop in the process of designing the LATR will be informative for the general CMB community, and for future CMB experiments like CMB-S4.",18,[],1
1807.07093,astro-ph,"We introduce a novel abundance matching technique that produces a more accurate estimate of the pre-infall halo mass, equation, for satellite galaxies. To achieve this, we abundance match with the mean star formation rate, averaged over the time when a galaxy was forming stars, equation, instead of the stellar mass, equation. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the GAMA survey and the Bolshoi simulation, we obtain a statistical equation relation in equation. We then compare the pre-infall halo mass, equation, derived from this relation with the pre-infall dynamical mass, equation, for 21 nearby dSph and dIrr galaxies, finding a good agreement between the two. As a first application, we use our new equation relation to empirically measure the cumulative mass function of a volume-complete sample of bright Milky Way satellites within 280 kpc of the Galactic centre. Comparing this with a suite of cosmological 'zoom' simulations of Milky Way-mass halos that account for subhalo depletion by the Milky Way disc, we find no missing satellites problem above equation in the Milky Way. We discuss how this empirical method can be applied to a larger sample of nearby spiral galaxies.",18,[],1
1801.00495,astro-ph,"The so-called sdA stars are defined by having H-rich spectra and surface gravities similar to hot subdwarf stars, but effective temperature below the zero-age horizontal branch. Their evolutionary history is an enigma: their surface gravity is too high for main sequence stars, but too low for single evolution white dwarfs. They are most likely byproducts of binary evolution, including blue-stragglers, extremely-low mass white dwarf stars (ELMs) and their precursors (pre-ELMs). A small number of ELMs with similar properties to sdAs is known. Other possibilities include metal-poor A/F dwarfs, second generation stars, or even stars accreted from dwarf galaxies. In this work, we analyse colours, proper motions and spacial velocities of a sample of sdAs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to assess their nature and evolutionary origin. We define a probability of belonging to the main sequence and a probability of being a (pre-)ELM based on these properties. We find that 7 per cent of the sdAs are more likely to be (pre-)ELMs than main sequence stars. However, the spacial velocity distribution suggests that over 35 per cent of them cannot be explained as single metal-poor A/F stars.",18,[],1
1810.10686,astro-ph,"Alignment of dust grains in astrophysical environments results in the polarization of starlight as well as the polarization of radiation emitted by dust. We demonstrate the advances in grain alignment theory allow the use of linear and circular polarization to probe not only the magnetic field, but also dust composition, the dust environment, etc. We revisit the process of grain alignment by Radiative Torques (RATs) and focus on constraining magnetic susceptibility of grains via observations. We discuss the possibility of observational testing of the magnetic properties of grains as the alignment changes from being in respect to the magnetic field to being in respect to the radiation direction. This opens both a possibility of constraining the uncertain parameters of the RATs theory and provides a new way of measuring magnetic fields in interstellar medium and circumstellar regions. We provide a detailed discussion of the precession induced both by the magnetic field and the anisotropic radiation and revisit a number of key processes related to magnetic response of the grains. We consider various effects that increase the rate of magnetic relaxation both in silicate and carbonaceous grains. In particular, we find a new relaxation process related to the change of the amplitude of internal magnetization within a wobbling triaxial grain and identify a range of grain sizes in which this effect can dominate the internal alignment of angular momentum within grain axes. We show that these relaxation processes significantly change the dynamics of grains in the presence of RATs. We apply our analysis for observed grain alignment in special environments to put constraints on the enhanced magnetic properties of dust grains in the cloud near supernovae, in cometary coma, and protoplanetary disks.",18,[],1
1806.10651,astro-ph,"Close encounters (CEs) between celestial objects may exert significant influence on their orbits. The influence will be even enhanced when two groups of celestial objects are confined in stable orbital configurations, e.g. in adjacent mean motion resonances (MMRs). Plutinos and Neptune Trojans, trapped in the 2:3 and 1:1 MMRs with Neptune respectively, are such examples. %Meanwhile, many objects among these two groups have peculiar orbits, seemingly as the vestige of CEs. As the first part of our investigation, this paper provides a detailed description of CEs between Plutinos and Trojans and their potential influences on the Trojans' orbits. Statistical analyses of CE data from numerical simulations reveal the randomness lying in the CEs between the two planetesimals. The closest positions of CEs distribute symmetrically inside the given CE region and no particular bias is found between the positive and negative effects on the orbital elements of Trojans. Based on the Gaussian approximation on the distribution of the velocity orientation of Plutino, and the integral derivatives of Gaussian perturbation equations, a theoretical method is built to estimate the CE effects. To further verify the randomness of CEs, a Monte Carlo approach is applied, and it generates distribution features consistent with the numerical results. In summary, CEs brought by realistic Plutinos exert impartial effects and tiny total influence on the orbital elements of Trojans. However, driven by the random walk mechanism, tiny effects may accumulate to a prominent variation given sufficient CEs, which will be discussed in the accompanying paper.",18,[],1
1810.05755,astro-ph,"We study the oscillations of an axisymmetric, viscous, radiative, general relativistic hydrodynamical simulation of a geometrically thin disk around a non-rotating, equation black hole. The numerical setup is initialized with a Novikov-Thorne, gas-pressure-dominated accretion disk, with an initial mass accretion rate of equation (where equation is the Eddington luminosity and equation is the speed of light). Viscosity is treated with the equation-prescription. The simulation was evolved for about equation Keplerian orbital periods at three Schwarzschild radii (ISCO radius). Power density spectra of the radial and vertical fluid velocity components, the total (gas equation radiation) midplane pressure, and the vertical component of radiative flux from the photosphere, all reveal strong power at the local breathing oscillation frequency. The first, second and third harmonics of the breathing oscillation are also clearly seen in the data. We quantify the properties of these oscillations by extracting eigenfunctions of the radial and vertical velocity components and total pressure. This confirms that these oscillations are associated with breathing motion.",18,[],1
1804.08245,astro-ph,"Chemical diversity of the gas in low-mass protostellar cores is widely recognized. In order to explore its origin, a survey of chemical composition toward 36 Class 0/I protostars in the Perseus molecular cloud complex, which are selected in an unbiased way under certain physical conditions, has been conducted with IRAM 30 m and NRO 45 m telescope. Multiple lines of C2H, c-C3H2 and CH3OH have been observed to characterize the chemical composition averaged over a 1000 au scale around the protostar. The derived beam-averaged column densities show significant chemical diversity among the sources, where the column density ratios of C2H/CH3OH are spread out by 2 orders of magnitude. From previous studies, the hot corino sources have abundant CH3OH but deficient C2H, their C2H/CH3OH column density ratios being relatively low. In contrast, the warm-carbon-chain chemistry (WCCC) sources are found to reveal the high C2H/CH3OH column density ratios. We find that the majority of the sources have intermediate characters between these two distinct chemistry types. A possible trend is seen between the C2H/CH3OH ratio and the distance of the source from the edge of a molecular cloud. The sources located near cloud edges or in isolated clouds tend to have a high C2H/CH3OH ratio. On the other hand, the sources having a low C2H/CH3OH ratio tend to be located in inner regions of the molecular cloud complex. This result gives an important clue to an understanding of the origin of the chemical diversity of protostellar cores in terms of environmental effects.",18,[],1

Known background components and the hypothetical flux from unstable dark matter are fitted to the experimental data.

1808.07399,astro-ph,"We present a new Monte Carlo code for Comptonisation in Astrophysics (MoCA). To our knowledge MoCA is the first code that uses a single photon approach in a full special relativity scenario, and including also Klein-Nishina effects as well as polarisation. In this paper we describe in detail how the code works, and show first results from the case of extended coronae in accreting sources Comptonising the accretion disc thermal emission. We explored both a slab and a spherical geometry, to make comparison with public analytical codes more easy. Our spectra are in good agreement with those from analytical codes for low/moderate optical depths, but differ significantly, as expected, for optical depths larger than a few. Klein-Nishina effects become relevant above 100 keV depending on the optical thickness and thermal energy of the corona. We also calculated the polarisation properties for the two geometries, which show that X-ray polarimetry is a very useful tool to discriminate between them.",18,[],1
1801.07245,astro-ph,"We present the results of a global, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulation of an accretion disk with a rotating, weakly magnetized central star. The disk is threaded by a weak, large-scale poloidal magnetic field, and the central star has no strong stellar magnetosphere initially. Our simulation investigates the structure of the accretion flows from a turbulent accretion disk onto the star. The simulation reveals that fast accretion onto the star at high latitudes occurs even without a stellar magnetosphere. We find that the failed disk wind becomes the fast, high-latitude accretion as a result of angular momentum exchange mediated by magnetic fields well above the disk, where the Lorentz force that decelerates the rotational motion of gas can be comparable to the centrifugal force. Unlike the classical magnetospheric accretion scenario, fast accretion streams are not guided by magnetic fields of the stellar magnetosphere. Nevertheless, the accretion velocity reaches the free-fall velocity at the stellar surface due to the efficient angular momentum loss at a distant place from the star. This study provides a possible explanation why Herbig Ae/Be stars whose magnetic fields are generally not strong enough to form magnetospheres also show indications of fast accretion. A magnetically driven jet is not formed from the disk in our model. The differential rotation cannot generate sufficiently strong magnetic fields for the jet acceleration because the Parker instability interrupts the field amplification.",18,[],1
1805.08139,astro-ph,"The cross-correlation study of the unresolved equation-ray background (UGRB) with galaxy clusters has a potential to reveal the nature of the UGRB. In this paper, we perform a cross-correlation analysis between equation-ray data by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) and a galaxy cluster catalogue from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey. The Subaru HSC cluster catalogue provides a wide and homogeneous large-scale structure distribution out to the high redshift at equation, which has not been accessible in previous cross-correlation studies. We conduct the cross-correlation analysis not only for clusters in the all redshift range (equation) of the survey, but also for subsamples of clusters divided into redshift bins, the low redshift bin (equation) and the high redshift bin (equation), to utilize the wide redshift coverage of the cluster catalogue. We find the evidence of the cross-correlation signals with the significance of 2.0-2.3equation for all redshift and low-redshift cluster samples. On the other hand, for high-redshift clusters, we find the signal with weaker significance level (1.6-1.9equation).

1805.11332,astro-ph,"The second Gaia data release contains the identification of 147 535 low-mass (equation) rotational modulation variable candidates on (or close to) the main sequence, together with their rotation period and modulation amplitude. The richness, the period and amplitude range, and the photometric precision of this sample make it possible to unveil, for the first time, signatures of different surface inhomogeneity regimes in the amplitude-period density diagram. The modulation amplitude distribution shows a clear bimodality, with an evident gap at periods equation d. The low amplitude branch, in turn, shows a period bimodality with a main clustering at periods equation 5 - 10 d and a secondary clustering of ultra-fast rotators at equation d. The amplitude-period multimodality is correlated with the position in the period-absolute magnitude (or period-color) diagram, with the low- and high-amplitude stars occupying different preferential locations. Here we argue that such a multimodality represents a further evidence of the existence of different regimes of surface inhomogeneities in young and middle-age low-mass stars and we lay out possible scenarios for their evolution, which manifestly include rapid transitions from one regime to another. In particular, the data indicate that stars spinning up close to break-up velocity undergo a very rapid change in their surface inhomogeneities configuration, which is revealed here for the first time. The multimodality can be exploited to identify field stars of age equation 100 -- 600 Myr belonging to the slow-rotator low-amplitude sequence, for which age can be estimated from the rotation period via gyrochronology relationships.",18,[],1
1811.09903,astro-ph,"Linear-cosmology observables, such as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), or the large-scale distribution of matter, have long been used as clean probes of dark matter (DM) interactions with baryons. It is standard to model the DM as an ideal fluid with a thermal Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) velocity distribution, in order to compute the heat and momentum-exchange rates relevant to these probes. This approximation only applies in the limit where DM self-interactions are frequent enough to efficiently redistribute DM velocities. It does not accurately describe weakly self-interacting particles, whose velocity distribution unavoidably departs from MB once they decouple from baryons. This article lays out a new formalism required to accurately model DM-baryon scattering, even when DM self-interactions are negligible. The ideal fluid equations are replaced by the collisional Boltzmann equation for the DM phase-space distribution. The collision operator is approximated by a Fokker-Planck operator, constructed to recover the exact heat and momentum exchange rates, and allowing for an efficient numerical implementation. Numerical solutions to the background evolution are presented, which show that the MB approximation can over-estimate the heat-exchange rate by factors of ~ 2-3, especially for light DM particles. A Boltzmann-Fokker-Planck hierarchy for perturbations is derived. This new formalism allows to explore a wider range of DM models, and will be especially relevant for upcoming ultra-high-sensitivity CMB probes.",18,[],1

For each bin, we model the data as a truncated NFW profile plus a 2-halo term, taking into account uncertainties related to concentration and miscentring. From the retrieved estimates of the mean halo masses, we construct the equation-equation and the equation-equation relations. The relations extend over more than one order of magnitude in mass, down to equation at equation = 0.2 (0.5), with small evolution in redshift.

1810.01559,astro-ph,"Recent studies of the diffuse parts of molecular clouds have revealed the presence of parallel, ordered low-density filaments termed striations. Flows along magnetic field lines, Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities and hydromagnetic waves are amongst the various formation mechanisms proposed. Through a synergy of observational, numerical and theoretical analysis, previous studies singled out the hydromagnetic waves model as the only one that can account for the observed properties of striations. Based on the predictions of that model, we develop here a method for measuring the temporal evolution of striations through a combination of molecular and dust continuum observations. Our method allows us to not only probe temporal variations in molecular clouds but also estimate the strength of both the ordered and fluctuating components of the magnetic field projected on the plane-of-the-sky. We benchmark our new method against chemical and radiative transfer effects through two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations coupled with non-equilibrium chemical modelling and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium line radiative transfer. We find good agreement between theoretical predictions, simulations and observations of striations in the Taurus molecular cloud.

1802.01953,astro-ph,"Finding the sources responsible for the hydrogen reionization is one of the most pressing issues in cosmology. Bright QSOs are known to ionize their surrounding neighborhood, but they are too few to ensure the required HI ionizing background. A significant contribution by faint AGNs, however, could solve the problem, as recently advocated on the basis of a relatively large space density of faint active nuclei at z>4. We have carried out an exploratory spectroscopic program to measure the HI ionizing emission of 16 faint AGNs spanning a broad U-I color interval, with I~21-23 and 3.6<z<4.2. These AGNs are three magnitudes fainter than the typical SDSS QSOs (M1450<~-26) which are known to ionize their surrounding IGM at z>~4. The LyC escape fraction has been detected with S/N ratio of ~10-120 and is between 44 and 100% for all the observed faint AGNs, with a mean value of 74% at 3.6<z<4.2 and -25.1<M1450<-23.3, in agreement with the value found in the literature for much brighter QSOs (M1450<~-26) at the same redshifts. The LyC escape fraction of our faint AGNs does not show any dependence on the absolute luminosities or on the observed U-I colors. Assuming that the LyC escape fraction remains close to ~75% down to M1450~-18, we find that the AGN population can provide between 16 and 73% (depending on the adopted luminosity function) of the whole ionizing UV background at z~4, measured through the Lyman forest. This contribution increases to 25-100% if other determinations of the ionizing UV background are adopted. Extrapolating these results to z~5-7, there are possible indications that bright QSOs and faint AGNs can provide a significant contribution to the reionization of the Universe, if their space density is high at M1450~-23.",18,[],1

The rotation-corrected radial velocity dispersion of the GC system is estimated to be equation 160 km sequation. The rotation parameter equation of the GC system is derived to be 1.47equation, which is one of the largest among known early-type galaxies. The ages and metallicities of the GCs, which show the same trend as the results based on Lick indices, are derived from full spectrum fitting (ULySS). About a half of the GCs are an intermediate-age population of which the mean age is equation 3.7 equation 1.9 Gyr, having a mean [Fe/H] value of --0.26. The other half are old and metal-poor.

Our results highlight the difficulty in separating dynamical process from finite-N effects. While we argue that our analysis points to the presence of the instability in simulated triaxial systems, discreteness appears to play a role in mimicking the instability.

We have met milestone #1 with a comfortable margin. The average accuracy obtained over the three datasets is 5.75e-5 L/D, which is 4 times better than the milestone requirement, or equivalent to 2.5microarcsec on 2.4m telescope, or 1.5microarcsec for a 4m telescope, working in the visible band. These results show the potential of this technique to enable detection and measure masses of Earth-like planets around nearby stars, hence bringing a real benefit to the astronomy community.

We performed three different high-contrast imaging runs and met the milestone #2 of 5e-7 raw contrast for all of them. On average, we obtained 3.33e-7 raw contrast considering all data sets. This result is 35% better than the milestone #2 requirement. We validated the stability of the high-contrast region by averaging frames and subtracting the average from single frames, which resulted in contrast improvement of approximately one order of magnitude, reaching 2.72e-8 contrast.

Elements of the V and Cr columns, in contrast, remain BCC at all temperatures. The energy landscape of BCC/HCP elements exhibits an alternating slide instability, while the normal BCC elements remain stable as BCC structures. This instability is verified by the presence of unstable elastic constants and vibrational modes for BCC/HCP elements, while those elastic constants and modes are stable in BCC elements. We show that a pseudogap opening in the density of states at the Fermi level drives the Burgers distortion in BCC/HCP elements, suggesting the transition is of the Jahn-Teller-Peierls type. The pseudogap lies below the Fermi level for regular BCC elements in the V and Cr columns of the periodic table. The wave vector equation when the gap opens relates to the reciprocal lattice vector G=(1 equation equation) of the distorted BCC structure as equation=equationG. BCC binary alloys containing both BCC/HCP and BCC elements exhibit a similar instability but stabilize part way through the BCC to HCP transition.",18,[],8
1812.01368,cond-mat,"We have investigated the chiral charge-density wave (CDW) in equation-VSeequation using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements and optical polarimetry measurements. With the STM mesurements, we revealed that the CDW intensities along each triple-equation directions are different. Thus the rotational symmetry of equation-VSeequation is lower than that in typical two-dimentional triple-equation CDWs. We found that the CDW peaks form a kagome lattice rather than a triangular lattice. The Friedel oscillations have the chirality and the periodicity reflected properties of the background CDW. With the optical measurements in equation-VSeequation, we also observed a lower rotational symmetry with the polarization dependence of the transient reflectivity variation, which is consistent with the STM result on a microscopic scale. Both equation-TiSeequation and equation-VSeequation show chiral CDWs, which implies that such waves are usual for CDWs with the condition equation.",18,[],8
1807.09323,cond-mat,"Controlled anisotropic growth of two-dimensional materials provides an approach for the synthesis of large single crystals and nanoribbons, which are promising for applications as low-dimensional semiconductors and in next-generation optoelectronic devices. In particular, the anisotropic growth of transition metal dichalcogenides induced by the substrate is of great interest due to its operability. To date, however, their substrate-induced anisotropic growth is typically driven by the optimization of experimental parameters without uncovering the fundamental mechanism. Here, the anisotropic growth of monolayer tungsten disulfide on an ST-X quartz substrate is achieved by chemical vapor deposition, and the mechanism of substrate-induced anisotropic growth is examined by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. These results show that, besides the variation of substrate adsorption, the chalcogen to metal (C/M) ratio is a major contributor to the large growth anisotropy and the polarization of undergrowth and overgrowth; either perfect isotropy or high anisotropy can be expected when the C/M ratio equals 2.0 by properly controlling the linear relationship between gas flux and temperature.",18,[],8
1811.12780,cond-mat,"The question whether ferroelectricity (FE) may coexist with a metallic or highly conducting state, or rather it must be suppressed by the screening from the free charges, is the focus of a rapidly increasing number of theoretical studies and is finally receiving positive experimental responses. The issue is closely related to the thermoelectric and multiferroic (also magnetic) applications of FE materials, where the electrical conductivity is required or spurious. In these circumstances, the traditional methods for probing ferroelectricity are hampered or made totally ineffective by the free charges, which screen the polar response to an external electric field. This fact may explain why more than 40 years passed between the first proposals of FE metals and the present experimental and theoretical activity. The measurement of the elastic moduli, Young's modulus in the present case, versus temperature is an effective method for studying the influence of doping on a FE transition because the elastic properties are unaffected by electrical conductivity. In this manner, it is shown that the FE transitions of BaTiO3-d are not suppressed by electron doping through O vacancies; only the onset temperatures are depressed, but the magnitudes of the softenings, and hence of the piezoelectric activity, are initially even increased.",18,[],8
1806.04927,cond-mat,"Collective electronic fluctuations in correlated materials give rise to various important phenomena, such as existence of the charge ordering, superconductivity, Mott insulating and magnetic phases, plasmon and magnon modes, and other interesting features of such systems. Unfortunately, description of these correlation effects requires significant efforts, since they almost entirely rely on strong local and nonlocal electron-electron interactions. Some collective phenomena, such as magnetism, can be sufficiently described by a simple Heisenberg-like models that are formulated in terms of bosonic variables. This fact suggests that other many-body excitations can also be described by simple bosonic models in spirit of the Heisenberg theory. Here we derive an effective bosonic action for charge degrees of freedom for the extended Hubbard model and define a physical regime where the obtained action reduces to a classical Hamiltonian of an effective Ising model.",18,[],8

By applying mean-field theory, we derive general equations for equation and equation in the presence of SOC and the Zeeman fields for 2D Fermi-Hubbard lattice models, and apply our results to a 2D square lattice. We show that conventional spin-imbalanced FF states without SOC can be observed at finite temperatures and that FF phases are further stabilized against thermal fluctuations by introducing SOC. We also propose how topologically non-trivial SOC-induced FF phases could be identified experimentally by studying the total density profiles. Furthermore, the relative behavior of transverse and longitudinal superfluid weight components and the role of the geometric superfluid contribution are discussed.",18,[],8

We undertake a numerical experiment performing Monte Carlo simulations of the square-lattice random-bond Ising and Blume-Capel models under a periodically oscillating magnetic field. For the case of the Blume-Capel model we analyze the universality principles of the dynamic disordered-induced continuous transition at the low-temperature regime of the phase diagram. A detailed finite-size scaling analysis indicates that both nonequilibrium phase transitions belong to the universality class of the corresponding equilibrium random Ising model.,18,[],8

1812.02917,cond-mat,"Implying perturbation theory, the impact of the dipole dipole interaction (DDI) on the thermodynamic properties of a homogeneous electron gas at zero temperature is investigated. Through the second quantization formalism, the analytic expressions for the ground state energy and the DDI energy are obtained. In this paper, the DDI energy has similarities with the previous works done by others. We show that its general behavior depends on density and the total angular momentum. Especially, it is found that the DDI energy has a highly state-dependent behavior. With the growth of density, the magnitude of DDI energy, which is found to be the summation of all energy contributions of the states with even and odd total angular momenta, grows linearly. It is also found that for the states with even and odd total angular momenta, the DDI energy contributions are corresponding to the positive and negative values, respectively. In particular, an increase of total angular momentum leads to decline in the magnitude of energy contribution. Therefore, the dipole dipole interaction reveals distinct characteristics in comparison with central like interactions.",18,[],8

A particular class of junctions naturally leads to the emergence of conductance plateaus and a ""winner-takes-all"" conducting path that spans the entire network, and which we show corresponds to the lowest-energy connectivity path. These results point to the possibility of independently addressing memory or conductance states in complex systems and is expected to have important implications for neuromorphic devices based on reservoir computing.",18,[],8
1811.03198,cond-mat,"Bi2Te3-xSex family has been the n-type start-of-the-art thermoelectric materials near room temperatures (RT) for more than half-century, which dominates the active cooling and novel waves harvesting application near RT. However, the drawbacks of brittle nature and Te-containing restrict the further applications exploring. Here, we show that a Mg3letterSbxBi2-x family ((ZT)avg =1.05) could be a promising substitute for the Bi2Te3-xSex family ((ZT)avg =0.9-1.0) in the temperature range of 50-250 \degC based on the comparable thermoelectric performance through a synergistic effect from the tunable band gap using the alloy effect and the suppressible Mg-vacancy formation using interstitial Mn dopant. The former is to shift the optimal thermoelectric performance to near RT, and latter is helpful to partially decouple the electrical transport and thermal transport in order to get an optimal RT power factor. A positive temperature-dependence of band gap suggested this family is also a superior medium-temperature thermoelectric material for the significantly suppressed bipolar effect. Furthermore, a two times higher mechanical toughness, compared with Bi2Te3-xSex family, consolidates the promising substitute for the start-of-art n-type thermoelectric materials near RT.",18,[],8

The hybridization is further confirmed by the formation of the hybridization gap revealed by temperature-dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Moreover, we find the hybridization strength in CeIn3 is much weaker than that in the more two-dimensional compounds CeCoIn5 and CeIrIn5.

1802.07387,cond-mat,"As a typical multiphase fluid flow process, drainage in porous media is of fundamental interest in nature and industrial applications. During drainage processes in unsaturated soils and porous media in general, saturated clusters, in which a liquid phase fully occupies the pore space between solid grains, affect the relative permeability and effective stress of the system. In this study, we experimentally studied drainage processes in unsaturated granular media as a model porous system. The distribution of saturated clusters is analysed by an optical imaging method under different drainage conditions, in which pore-scale information from Voronoi and Delaunay tessellation was used to characterise the topology of saturated cluster distributions. By employing statistical analyses, the observed spatial and temporal information of multiphase flow and fluid entrapment in porous media are described. The results indicate that the distributions of both the crystallised cell size and pore size are positively correlated to the spatial and temporal distribution of saturated cluster sizes. The saturated cluster size is found to follow a lognormal distribution, in which the generalised Bond number correlates negatively to the scale parameter and positively to the shape parameter. These findings can be used to connect pore-scale behaviour with overall hydro-mechanical characteristics in partially saturated porous media, using both the degree of saturation and generalised Bond number.",18,[],8

This structural transition into a triclinic phase is characterized by a very strong dimerization of the Ru-Ru bonds, accompanied by a collapse of the magnetic susceptibility. Ab initio quantum-chemistry calculations disclose a pressure-induced enhancement of the direct 4d-4d bonding on particular Ru-Ru links, causing a sharp increase of the antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. These combined experimental and computational data show that the Kitaev spin liquid phase in alpha-RuCl3 strongly competes with the crystallization of spin singlets into a valence bond solid.",18,[],8
1810.01909,cond-mat,"By using the dyadic Green's matrix spectral method, we demonstrate that aperiodic deterministic Vogel spirals made of electric dipoles support light localization in three dimensions, an effect that does not occur in traditional uniform random media. We discover a light localization transition in Vogel spiral arrays embedded in three-dimensional space by evaluating the Thouless conductance, the level spacing statistics, and by performing a finite-size scaling. This light localization transition is different from the Anderson transition because Vogel spirals are deterministic structures. Moreover, this transition occurs when the vector character of light is fully taken into account, in contrast to what is expected for traditional uniform random media of point-like scatterers. We show that light localization in Vogel arrays is a collective phenomenon that involves the contribution of multiple length scales. Vogel spirals are suitable photonic platforms to localize light thanks to their distinctive structural correlation properties that enable collective electromagnetic excitations with strong light-matter coupling. Our results unveil the importance of aperiodic correlations for the engineering of photonic media with strongly enhanced light-matter coupling compared to the traditional periodic and homogeneous random media.",18,[],8
1806.02601,cond-mat,"Diagonal flipping of a rhombus consisting of two triangles sharing a common edge with atoms (ions) in vertices of the triangles is considered as an elementary act of the polymorphic transformation in metals.

The energy threshold has been calculated in the framework of Morse interatomic pair potential. Numerical coefficients for the approximation of the pair potential function have been scaled by experimental values of the sublimation energy and temperature dependencies of elastic constants for Fe, Cr, Mn. Values of the energy threshold at 1193 K were estimated equal to 195, 150 and 94 kJ/mole for pure Cr, Fe and Mn respectively, i.e. in the same sequence as values of elastic bulk modulus for these metals.

1803.08726,cond-mat,"Robust quantum systems rely on having a protective environment with minimized relaxation channels. Superconducting gaps play an important role in the design of such environments. The interaction of localized single spins with a conventional superconductor generally leads to intrinsically extremely narrow Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) resonances protected inside the superconducting gap. However, this may not apply to superconductors with nontrivial, energy dependent order parameters. Exploiting the Fe-doped two-band superconductor NbSeequation, we show that due to the nontrivial relation between its complex valued and energy dependent order parameters, YSR states are no longer restricted to be inside the gap. They can appear outside the gap (i. e. inside the coherence peaks), where they can also acquire a substantial intrinsic lifetime broadening. T-matrix scattering calculations show excellent agreement with the experimental data and relate the intrinsic YSR state broadening to the imaginary part of the host's order parameters. Our results suggest that non-thermal relaxation mechanisms contribute to the finite lifetime of the YSR states, even within the superconducting gap, making them less protected against residual interactions than previously assumed. YSR states may serve as valuable probes for nontrivial order parameters promoting a judicious selection of protective superconductors.",18,[],8
1807.00721,cond-mat,"We review the magnetic and orbital ordered states in \cro by performing Resonant Elastic X-ray Scattering (REXS) at the Ru Lequation-edges. In principle, the point symmetry at Ru sites does not constrain the direction of the magnetic moment below equation.

Taking advantage of the large resonant enhancement of the magnetic scattering close to the Ru Lequation and Lequation absorption edges, we monitored the azimuthal, thermal and energy dependence of the REXS intensity and find that a canting (equation) along the equation-orthorhombic axis is present. No signal was found for equation despite this component also being allowed by symmetry. Such findings are interpreted by a microscopic model Hamiltonian, and pose new constraints on the parameters describing the model. Using the same technique we reviewed the accepted orbital ordering picture. We detected no symmetry breaking associated with the signal increase at the ""so-called"" orbital ordering temperature (equation K). We did not find any changes of the orbital pattern even through the antiferromagnetic transition, suggesting that, if any, only a complex rearrangement of the orbitals, not directly measurable using linearly polarized light, can take place.",18,[],8
1806.08100,cond-mat,"A simple way to investigate theoretically the Raman spectra (RS) of nonpolar nanoparticles is proposed. For this aim we substitute the original lattice optical phonon eigenproblem by the continuous Klein-Fock-Gordon-like equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. This approach provides the basis for the continuous description of optical phonons in the same manner how the elasticity theory describes the longwavelength acoustic phonons. Together with continuous reformulation of the bond polarization model it allows to calculate the RS of nanoparticles without referring to their atomistic structure. It ensures the powerful tool for interpreting the experimental data, studying the effects of particle shape and their size distribution. We successfully fit recent experimental data on very small diamond and silicon particles, for which the commonly used phonon confinement model fails. The predictions of our theory are compared with recent results obtained within the dynamical matrix method - bond polarization model (DMM-BPM) approach and an excellent agreement between them is found. The advantages of the present theory are its simplicity and the rapidity of calculations.

1811.08443,cond-mat,"In this paper, we examine the viscoelastic properties of integer quantum Hall (IQH) states in a tilted magnetic field. In particular, we explore to what extent the tilted-field system behaves like a two-dimensional electron gas with anisotropic mass in the presence of strain deformations. We first review the Kubo formalism for viscosity in an external magnetic field, paying particular attention to the role of rotational symmetry and contact terms. Next, we compute the conductivity, stress, and viscosity tensors for IQH states in the presence of a tilted field and vertical confining potential. By comparing our results with the recently developed bimetric formalism, we show that, at the level of the contracted Hall viscosity tensor, the mapping between tilted field and effective mass anisotropy holds only if we simultaneously modify the background perpendicular magnetic field; in other words, a simultaneous measurement of the density, contracted Hall viscosity, and Hall conductivity at fixed particle number can distinguish between tilted field and effective mass anisotropy. Additionally, we show that in the presence of a tilted magnetic field, the stress tensor acquires an unusual anisotropic ground state average, leading to anomalous elastic response functions. We develop a formalism for projecting a three-dimensional Hamiltonian with confining potential and magnetic field to a two-dimensional Hamiltonian in order to further address the phenomenology of the tilted-field IQH fluid. We find that the projected fluid couples non-minimally to geometric deformations, indicating the presence of internal geometric degrees of freedom.",18,[],8

We show that these arise because a hole created in the Mott layer moves to and propagates in the metallic layer while retaining memory of the Mott layer's magnetism.

For the rotation case, in addition to the phase separation, we demonstrate particularly that the spin-orbit coupling can result in the hidden vortices and hidden vortex-antivortex pairs. The corresponding entire phase diagrams are determined, depending on the interplay of the spin-orbit coupling strength, the rotation frequency, and Rabi frequency, which reveals the critical condition of the occurrence of the hidden vortices and vortex-antivortex pairs. The hidden vortices here are proved to be long-lived in the time scale of experiment by the dynamic analysis.

1809.04785,cond-mat,"Using electron beam manipulation, we enable deterministic motion of individual Si atoms in graphene along predefined trajectories. Structural evolution during the dopant motion was explored, providing information on changes of the Si atom neighborhood during atomic motion and providing statistical information of possible defect configurations. The combination of a Gaussian mixture model and principal component analysis applied to the deep learning-processed experimental data allowed disentangling of the atomic distortions for two different graphene sublattices. This approach demonstrates the potential of e-beam manipulation to create defect libraries of multiple realizations of the same defect and explore the potential of symmetry breaking physics. The rapid image analytics enabled via a deep learning network further empowers instrumentation for e-beam controlled atom-by-atom fabrication.

1801.02630,cond-mat,"We propose a method for solving the Schrodinger-Poisson problem that can be efficiently implemented in realistic 3D tight-binding models of semiconductor-based Majorana devices. The method is based on two key ideas: i) For a given geometry, the Poisson problem is only solved once (for each local orbital) and the results are stored as an interaction tensor; using this Green's function scheme, the Poisson component of the iteration procedure is reduced to a few simple summations. ii) The 3D problem is mapped into an effective multi-orbital 1D problem with molecular orbitals calculated self-consistently as the transverse modes of an infinite wire with the same electrostatic potential as the local electrostatic potential of the finite 3D device. To demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, we calculate the response of the system to an external magnetic field, the dependence of the effective chemical potential on the work function difference, and the dependence of the effective semiconductor-superconductor coupling on the applied gate potential. We find that different low-energy bands are characterized by similar effective couplings, which results in induced gap features characterized by a single energy scale. We also find that electrostatic effects are responsible for a partial suppression of the Majorana energy splitting oscillations. Finally, we show that a position-dependent work function difference can produce a non-homogeneous effective potential that is not affected by the screening due to the superconductor and is only partially suppressed by the charge inside the wire. In turn, this potential can induce trivial low-energy states that mimic the phenomenology of Majorana zero modes. Thus, any position-dependent work function difference (even at the 1% level) along the nanowire must be avoided through carefully engineered semiconductor-superconductor interfaces.",18,[],8

We find that the strong superconducting pairing interaction results mainly from the equation-like electrons of arsenic atoms and the equation phonon mode around the equation point, and the superconducting transition temperature can be as high as 30.8 K in the arsenene with 0.2 doped electrons per unit cell and 12\% applied biaxial tensile strain. This transition temperature is about ten times higher than that in the bulk arsenic under high pressure. It is also the highest transition temperature that is predicted for electron-doped two-dimensional elemental superconductors, including graphene, silicene, phosphorene, and borophene.",18,[],8
1806.06338,cond-mat,"We investigate the excitonic fluctuation and its mediated superconductivity in the quasi one-dimensional three-chain Hubbard model for TaequationNiSeequation known as a candidate material for the excitonic insulator. In the semiconducting case and the semimetallic case with a small band-overlapping where one conduction (equation) band and one valence (equation) band cross the Fermi level, the excitonic fluctuation with equation is enhanced due to the equation-equation Coulomb interaction and diverges towards the uniform excitonic order corresponding to the excitonic insulator. On the other hands, in the semimetallic case with a large band-overlapping where two equation bands and one equation band cross the Fermi level, the non-uniform excitonic fluctuation with equation corresponding to the nesting vector between the equation and equation Fermi-surfaces (FSs) becomes dominant and results in the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) excitonic order characterized by the condensation of excitons with finite center-of-mass momentum equation. Near the instability, the largely enhanced excitonic fluctuations mediate the equation-equation interband Cooper pairs with finite center-of-mass momentum resulting in the FFLO superconductivity, which is expected to be realized in the semimetallic TaequationNiSeequation under high pressure.",18,[],8
1802.07764,cond-mat,"We revealed that 180 degree ferroelectrics domain walls (FDWs) in a ferroelectric substrate, which induce p-n junctions in a graphene channel, lead to the nontrivial temperature and gate voltage dependences of the perpendicular and parallel modes of the integer quantum Hall effect. In particular the number of perpendicular modes v, corresponding to the p-n junction across the graphene channel varies with gate voltage increase from small integers to higher fractional numbers, e.g.v=1, 1.5, 2, ... 5.1,..9.1, 23 in the vicinity of the transition from ferroelectric to paraelectric phase.These numbers and their irregular sequence principally differ from the sequence of fractional numbers v=1.5,2.5,... reported earlier. The origin of the unusual v-numbers is significantly different numbers of the edge modes, v1 and v2, corresponding to significantly different concentration of carriers in the left (n1) and right (n1) domains of p-n junction boundary. The concentrations n1 and n2 are determined by the gate voltage and polarization contributions, and so their difference originates from the different direction of spontaneous polarization in different domains of ferroelectric substrate. The difference between n1 and n2 disappears with the vanishing of spontaneous polarization in a paraelectric phase. The phase transition from the ferroelectric to paraelectric phase can take place either with the temperature increase (temperature-induced phase transition) or with the decrease of ferroelectric substrate thickness (thickness-induced phase transition).",18,[],8

We discuss the crystal symmetry requirements more generally and show that they are met by the Re6X (X=Zr, Hf, Ti) family of TRS-breaking, but otherwise seemingly conventional, superconductors.

1802.08243,cond-mat,"The magnetic anisotropy and exchange coupling between spins localized at the positions of 3d transition metal atoms forming two-dimensional metal-organic coordination networks (MOCNs) grown on the Au(111) metal surface are studied. In particular, we consider MOCNs made of Ni or Mn metal centers linked by TCNQ (7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane) organic ligands, which form rectangular networks with 1:1 stoichiometry. Based on the analysis of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) data taken at T= 2.5 K, we find that Ni atoms in the Ni-TCNQ MOCNs are coupled ferromagnetically and do not show any significant magnetic anisotropy, while Mn atoms in the Mn-TCNQ MOCNs are coupled antiferromagnetically and do show a weak magnetic anisotropy with in-planemagnetization. We explain these observations using both amodelHamiltonian based on mean-fieldWeiss theory and density functional theory calculations that include spin-orbit coupling. Our main conclusion is that the antiferromagnetic coupling between Mn spins and the in-plane magnetization of the Mn spins can be explained neglecting effects due to the presence of the Au(111) surface, while for Ni-TCNQ the metal surface plays a role in determining the absence of magnetic anisotropy in the system.",18,[],8

In spin pumping experiments at room temperature, spin-to-charge conversion voltage due to the inverse Edelstein effect is clearly observed in Py/Cu/Tl-Pb trilayer samples. To confirm efficient spin-charge interconversion in Tl-Pb compounds, the direct Edelstein effect is also studied in the same trilayer samples by measuring modulation of the effective magnetization damping in the Py layer via the charge-to-spin conversion in the Tl-Pb layer.

1803.05603,cond-mat,"Most interesting phenomena of condensed matter physics originate from interactions among different degrees of freedom, making it a very intriguing yet challenging question how certain ground states emerge from only a limited number of atoms in assembly. This is especially the case for strongly correlated electron systems with overwhelming complexity. The Verwey transition of Fe3O4 is a classic example of this category, of which the origin is still elusive 80 years after the first report. Here we report, for the first time, that the Verwey transition of Fe3O4 nanoparticles exhibits size-dependent thermal hysteresis in magnetization, 57Fe NMR, and XRD measurements. The hysteresis width passes a maximum of 11 K when the size is 120 nm while dropping to only 1 K for the bulk sample. This behavior is very similar to that of magnetic coercivity and the critical sizes of the hysteresis and the magnetic single domain are identical. We interpret it as a manifestation of charge ordering and spin ordering correlation in a single domain.

1805.10870,cond-mat,Non-Gaussian nature of the probability distribution of particles' displacements in the supercooled temperature regime in glass-forming liquids are believed to be one of the major hallmarks of glass transition. It is already been established that this probability distribution which is also known as the van Hove function show universal exponential tail. The origin of such an exponential tail in the distribution function is attributed to the hopping motion of particles observed in the supercooled regime. The non-Gaussian nature can also be explained if one assumes that the system has heterogeneous dynamics in space and time. Thus exponential tail is the manifestation of dynamic heterogeneity. In this work we directly show that non-Gaussanity of the distribution of particles' displacements occur over the dynamic heterogeneity length scale and dynamical behaviour course grained over this length scale becomes homogeneous. We study the non-Gaussianity of van Hove function by systematically coarse graining at different length scale and extract the length scale of dynamic heterogeneity at which the shape of the van Hove function crosses over from non-Gaussian to Gaussian. The obtained dynamic heterogeneity scale is found to be in very good agreement with the scale obtained from other conventional methods.,18,[],8
1803.08172,cond-mat,"We investigate the electronic structure and several properties, and topological character, of the cubic time-reversal invariant intermetallic compounds PbPdequation and SnPdequation using density functional theory based methods. These compounds have a dispersionless band along the equation line, forming the top of the Pd equation bands and lying within a few meV of the Fermi level equation. Effects of the flat band on transport and optical properties have been inspected by varying the doping concentration treated with the virtual crystal approximation for substitution on the Pb site. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), we find triple nodal points and three-dimensional nodal loops, which are known to lead to surface bands and drumhead states, respectively, which we discuss for PbPdequation. SOC removes degeneracy in most of the zone, providing a topological index equation=1 on the equation plane that indicates a topological character on that plane. The isovalent and isostructural compound SnPdequation shows only minor differences in its electronic structures, so it is expected to display similar electronic, transport, and topological properties.",18,[],8
1801.10531,cond-mat,"The main aim of this paper is twofold: (1) Suggesting a statistical mechanical approach to the calculation of the generating function of restricted integer partition functions which count the number of partitions --- a way of writing an integer as a sum of other integers under certain restrictions. In this approach, the generating function of restricted integer partition functions is constructed from the canonical partition functions of various quantum gases. (2) Introducing a new type of restricted integer partition functions corresponding to general statistics which is a generalization of Gentile statistics in statistical mechanics; many kinds of restricted integer partition functions are special cases of this restricted integer partition function. Moreover, with statistical mechanics as a bridge, we reveals a mathematical fact: the generating function of restricted integer partition function is just the symmetric function which is a class of functions being invariant under the action of permutation groups. Using the approach, we provide some expressions of restricted integer partition functions as examples.",18,[],8
1804.06830,cond-mat,"The chirality of electronic Bloch bands is responsible for many intriguing properties of layered two-dimensional materials. We show that in bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), unlike in few-layer graphene and monolayer TMDCs, both intra-layer and inter-layer couplings give important contributions to the Berry-curvature in the equation and equation valleys of the Brillouin zone. The inter-layer contribution leads to the stacking dependence of the Berry curvature and we point out the differences between the commonly available 3R type and 2H type bilayers. Due to the inter-layer contribution the Berry curvature becomes highly tunable in double gated devices. We study the dependence of the valley Hall and spin Hall effects on the stacking type and external electric field. Although the valley and spin Hall conductivities are not quantized, in MoSequation 2H bilayers they may change sign as a function of the external electric field which is reminiscent of the behaviour of lattice Chern insulators.",18,[],8
1804.04761,cond-mat,"We present a simultaneous investigation of coherent spin dynamics in both localized and itinerant carriers in Fe/GaAs heterostructures using ultrafast and spin-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy. We find that for excitation densities that push the transient Fermi energy of photocarriers above the mobility edge there exist two distinct precession frequencies in the ob-served spin dynamics, allowing us to simultaneously monitor both localized and itinerant states. For low magnetic fields (below 3 T) the beat frequency between these two excitations evolves linearly, indicating that the nuclear polarization is saturated almost immediately and that the hyperfine coupling to these two states is comparable, despite the 100x enhancement in nuclear polarization provided by the presence of the Fe layer. At higher magnetic fields (above 3 T) the Zeeman energy drives reentrant localization of the photocarriers. Subtracting the constant hyperfine contribution from both sets of data allows us to extract the Lande g-factor for each state and estimate their energy relative to the bottom of the conduction band, yielding -2.16 meV and 17 meV for localized and itinerant states, respectively. This work advances our fundamental understanding of spin-spin interactions between electron and nuclear spin species, as well as between localized and itinerant electronics states, and therefore has implications for future work in both spintronics and quantum information/computation.",18,[],8

Spatially varying magnetic and electric confinement creates pairs of current carrying lines that drift in the same or opposite directions depending on whether confinement is applied by a magnetic split gate or a magnetic strip gate. We study the electronic structure through calculations of the local density of states and conductivity of the channel as a function of the chirality and wave-function overlap of these states.

1810.11356,cond-mat,"In previous studies, we have reported that double perovskite La2NiMnO6 presents a non-negligible potential for room temperature magnetocaloric tasks. With the aim of improving even further the cooling performances and the working temperature range of double perovskites, we report the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of La2MnFeO6 and ALaMnFeO6 (A = Sr, Ba, Ca) compounds. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Rietveld refinement show that La2MnFeO6 (LMFO) and CaLaMnFeO6 (CLMFO) samples crystallize in an orthorhombic structure with the Pnma space group. However, a rhombohedral structure with the R3C space group is obtained for BaLaMnFeO6 (BLMFO) and SrLaMnFeO6 (SLMFO) samples. Substituting La by Ba or Sr in LMFO leads to a clear increase of the Curie temperature (Tc) compared to LMFO from 150 K for BLMFO up to 350 K for SLMFO. Moreover, CLMFO shows the smallest Tc down to 70 K. Ferromagnetic-like behavior is observed for SLMFO and BLMFO while CLMFO's magnetism resembles that of LMFO. A clear connection between the structural parameters and the magnetic properties of these doped LMFO samples is unveiled as the highest Tc and the largest magnetization are observed for SLMFO which shows also bond angles closest to 180\deg and the smallest bond lengths, thus optimizing the superexchange interaction. The partial substitution of Sr for La leads in fact to a significant magnetocaloric effect over a wide operating temperature range extending beyond 300 K. For some optimal growth conditions, its entropy change varies slowly over an unusually large temperature range, which is of clear interest from a practical point of view.",18,[],8

We find that the time evolution of the system can be described in terms of equilibrium solutions at every time. We analyze the effect of the electronic interactions on the performance of the dot when operating as a quantum motor.   The main two effects of the interactions are a shift of the resonance and an enhancement of the efficiency with respect to a non-interacting dot. This is due to the appearance of additional ac-parameters accounting for the interactions that increase the pumping of particles while decreasing the conductance.",18,[],8
1808.08018,cond-mat,"We present a comparison of the characteristics of the magnetic domain walls in an atomic monolayer of Co on Pt(111) and a Ni/Fe atomic bilayer on Ir(111), based on spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy measurements. In both cases, the films exhibit a roughly triangular dislocation line pattern created by epitaxial strain relief, as well as out-of-plane ferromagnetic order. Domains with opposite magnetization are separated by domain walls with a unique rotational sense, demonstrating the important role of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction induced by the Co/Pt and the Fe/Ir interfaces. The domain walls in Co/Pt(111) are straight and usually found in geometrical constrictions of the film, where they can minimize their length. In contrast, the domain walls in Ni/Fe/Ir(111) follow complicated paths, which can be correlated to the structural triangular pattern. The comparison between the two systems shows that the structural patterns, despite their similarity, have a different impact on the domain walls. In the Co/Pt(111) case, the magnetic state is not influenced by the dislocation line network, in contrast to the Ni/Fe/Ir(111) system in which the formation of the walls is favored at specific positions of the structural pattern.",18,[],8

For small perturbations away from equilibrium, linear response (LR) theory provides the natural framework to study generic nonequilibrium processes. Here we use LR to derive TURs in a straightforward and unified way. Our approach allows us to generalize TURs to systems without local time reversal symmetry, including, for example, ballistic transport, and periodically driven classical and quantum systems. We find that for broken time reversal, the bounds on the relative uncertainty are controlled both by dissipation and by a parameter encoding the asymmetry of the Onsager matrix. We illustrate our results with an example from mesoscopic physics. We also extend our approach beyond linear response: for Markovian dynamics it reveals a connection between the TUR and current fluctuation theorems.",18,[],8

Such low fields were sufficient for toggling magnetic moments in the soft ferromagnetic (FM) layer (Ni80Fe20). It is found out that this switching provides the magnetic entropy change, which is up to 20 times larger than that achievable in a single Ni67Cu33 film subjected to such low fields.

1810.08186,cond-mat,"We review recent theoretical progress in the understanding and prediction of novel topological semimetals. Topological semimetals define a class of gapless electronic phases exhibiting topologically stable crossings of energy bands. Different types of topological semimetals can be distinguished based on the degeneracy of the band crossings, their codimension (e.g., point or line nodes), as well as the crystal space group symmetries on which the protection of stable band crossings relies. The dispersion near the band crossing is a further discriminating characteristic. These properties give rise to a wide range of distinct semimetal phases such as Dirac or Weyl semimetals, point or line node semimetals, and type-I or type-II semimetals. In this review we give a general description of various families of topological semimetals with an emphasis on proposed material realizations from first-principles calculations. The conceptual framework for studying topological gapless electronic phases is reviewed, with a particular focus on the symmetry requirements of energy band crossings, and the relation between the different families of topological semimetals is elucidated. In addition to the paradigmatic Dirac and Weyl semimetals, we pay particular attention to more recent examples of topological semimetals, which include nodal line semimetals, multifold fermion semimetals, triple-point semimetals. Less emphasis is placed on their surface state properties, responses to external probes, and recent experimental developments.",18,[],8

This situation has traditionally forced a difficult choice of either using slow internode communication or a potentially less accurate but smaller basis set such as Gaussians. Here, we introduce a hybrid representation of the single particle orbitals that combine a localized atomic basis set around atomic cores and B-splines in the interstitial regions to reduce the memory usage while retaining high speed of evaluation and either retaining or increasing overall accuracy.

Comparing the acoustic-wave-induced precession frequencies with precession induced by charge currents and with micromagnetic simulations we identify spatially non-uniform magnetization modes localized close the edge regions as being responsible for the optically induced magnetization dynamics. The experimental scheme even allows us to coherently control the magnetization precession using two acoustic pulses.

With increasing temperature the equation-axis phonon modes of TaequationNiSeequation become poorly discernible, as they are superimposed on the electronic background which gradually fills the energy gap near the monoclinic-to-orthorhombic phase transition temperature equation = 326 K. In TaequationNiSequation, which does not exhibit such a structural transition and remains orthorhombic down to low temperatures, the equation-axis phonon modes are superimposed on a persistent broad electronic mode centered near 16 meV.

1809.08517,cond-mat,"The need for increasingly powerful computing hardware has spawned many ideas stipulating, primarily, the replacement of traditional transistors with alternate ""switches"" that dissipate miniscule amounts of energy when they switch and provide additional functionality that are beneficial for information processing. An interesting idea that has emerged recently is the notion of using two-phase (piezoelectric/magnetostrictive) multiferroic nanomagnets with bistable (or multi-stable) magnetization states to encode digital information (bits), and switching the magnetization between these states with small voltages (that strain the nanomagnets) to carry out digital information processing. The switching delay is ~1 ns and the energy dissipated in the switching operation can be few to tens of aJ, which is comparable to, or smaller than, the energy dissipated in switching a modern-day transistor. Unlike a transistor, a nanomagnet is ""non-volatile"", so a nanomagnetic processing unit can store the result of a computation locally without refresh cycles, thereby allowing it to double as both logic and memory. These dual-role elements promise new, robust, energy-efficient, high-speed computing and signal processing architectures (usually non-Boolean and often non-von-Neumann) that can be more powerful, architecturally superior (fewer circuit elements needed to implement a given function) and sometimes faster than their traditional transistor-based counterparts.

The static and transient solutions are then combined to obtain the baseband response of the tip, i.e., the deflection signal demodulated with respect to the excitation. The baseband response generalizes the amplitude and phase response of the tip, and we use it to find explicit formulas describing the amplitude and phase modulation following the influence of external forces on the tip.

The results demonstrate a strong electron-mediated coupling between the internal stretch and low-energy CO modes, but also a significant role of surface motion.

Using numerical calculations on the lattice, we examine the case where the entangling boundary contains trihedral corners. The entropy contribution arising from these corners grows logarithmically in the entangled subsystem's size with a universal coefficient. Our numerical results provide evidence that this logarithmic coefficient has a simple structure determined by two universal functions characterizing the underlying critical theory and the geometry of the corner. This form is similar to that of the analogous coefficient appearing for smooth entangling surfaces. Furthermore, our results support the idea that one of the geometric factors in the corner coefficient is topological in nature and related to the Euler characteristic of the boundary, in direct analogy to the case of the smooth surface. We discuss implications, including the possibility that one can use trihedral corner contributions to the Renyi entropy to determine both of the universal central charges of the underlying critical theory.",18,[],8

An exotic quantum anomalous Hall insulator phase are found which has nonzero spin Chern number and nonzero valley Chern number and as a giant-application-potential spintronic and valleytronics in the two-ternimate devices based on the monolayer silicene for the information transmission. In fact, the gap-out action can be understanded by analyse the Dirac mass as well as the Zeeman splitting or the external-field-induced symmetry-broken, and the changes of gap has a general nonmonotone-variation characteristic under both the effects of electron filed-induced Rashba-coupling equation and the electron field-induced band gap, and the band inversion related to the spin-orbit coupling which absorbs both the spin and orbital angular of momentum may happen during this process. The quantized Hall/longitudinal conductivity together with the optical conductivity are also explored, we see that even in the quantum spin Hall phase without any magnetic field, the two-terminate conductivity can be reduced to the value equation by controlling the helical edge model, and it can be further reduced to equation by applying the magnetic field which similar to the graphene.",18,[],8
1812.07196,cond-mat,"Despite many similarities between electronics and optics, the hopping of the electron on a discrete atomic lattice gives rise to energy band nonparabolicity and anisotropy. The crucial influences of this effect on material properties and its incorporation into the continuum model have received widespread attention in the past half century. Here we predict the existence of a different effect due to the hopping of the electron across an atomically sharp interface. For a general lattice, its influence on transport could be equally important as the energy band nonparabolicity/anisotropy, but cannot be incorporated into the continuum model. On the honeycomb lattice of graphene, it leads to the breakdown of the conventional Klein tunneling -- one of the exotic phenomena of relativistic particles -- and the onset of tilted Klein tunneling. This works identifies a unique feature of the discrete atomic lattice for transport, which is relevant for ballistic electronic devices at high carrier densities.",18,[],8

1802.05004,cs,"Passwords are ubiquitous and most commonly used to authenticate users when logging into online services. Using high entropy passwords is critical to prevent unauthorized access and password policies emerged to enforce this requirement on passwords. However, with current methods of password storage, poor practices and server breaches have leaked many passwords to the public. To protect one's sensitive information in case of such events, passwords should be hidden from servers. Verifier-based password authenticated key exchange, proposed by Bellovin and Merrit (IEEE S\&P, 1992), allows authenticated secure channels to be established with a hash of a password (verifier). Unfortunately, this restricts password policies as passwords cannot be checked from their verifier. To address this issue, Kiefer and Manulis (ESORICS 2014) proposed zero-knowledge password policy check (ZKPPC). A ZKPPC protocol allows users to prove in zero knowledge that a hash of the user's password satisfies the password policy required by the server. Unfortunately, their proposal is not quantum resistant with the use of discrete logarithm-based cryptographic tools and there are currently no other viable alternatives. In this work, we construct the first post-quantum ZKPPC using lattice-based tools. To this end, we introduce a new randomised password hashing scheme for ASCII-based passwords and design an accompanying zero-knowledge protocol for policy compliance. Interestingly, our proposal does not follow the framework established by Kiefer and Manulis and offers an alternate construction without homomorphic commitments. Although our protocol is not ready to be used in practice, we think it is an important first step towards a quantum-resistant privacy-preserving password-based authentication and key exchange system.",18,[],7

To achieve this, we propose a novel neural network model comprised of a depth prediction module, a lens blur module, and a guided upsampling module. All modules are differentiable and are learned from data. To train our depth prediction module, we collect a dataset of 2462 RGB-D images captured by mobile phones with a dual-lens camera, and use existing segmentation datasets to improve border prediction. We further leverage a synthetic dataset with known depth to supervise the lens blur and guided upsampling modules. The effectiveness of our system and training strategies are verified in the experiments. Our method can generate high-quality shallow DoF images at high resolution, and produces significantly fewer artifacts than the baselines and existing solutions for single image shallow DoF synthesis.

1802.10419,cs,"Improving information flow in deep networks helps to ease the training difficulties and utilize parameters more efficiently. Here we propose a new convolutional neural network architecture with alternately updated clique (CliqueNet).

The CliqueNet has some unique properties. For each layer, it is both the input and output of any other layer in the same block, so that the information flow among layers is maximized. During propagation, the newly updated layers are concatenated to re-update previously updated layer, and parameters are reused for multiple times. This recurrent feedback structure is able to bring higher level visual information back to refine low-level filters and achieve spatial attention. We analyze the features generated at different stages and observe that using refined features leads to a better result. We adopt a multi-scale feature strategy that effectively avoids the progressive growth of parameters. Experiments on image recognition datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN and ImageNet show that our proposed models achieve the state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.",18,[],7
1802.05559,cs,"We study the fine-grained complexity of Leader Contributor Reachability (LCR) and Bounded-Stage Reachability (BSR), two variants of the safety verification problem for shared memory concurrent programs. For both problems, the memory is a single variable over a finite data domain. Our contributions are new verification algorithms and lower bounds. The latter are based on the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), the problem Set Cover, and cross-compositions.   LCR is the question whether a designated leader thread can reach an unsafe state when interacting with a certain number of equal contributor threads. We suggest two parameterizations: (1) By the size of the data domain D and the size of the leader L, and (2) by the size of the contributors C. We present algorithms for both cases. The key techniques are compact witnesses and dynamic programming. The algorithms run in O*((L(D1))(LD) * DD) and O*(2C) time, showing that both parameterizations are fixed-parameter tractable. We complement the upper bounds by (matching) lower bounds based on ETH and Set Cover. Moreover, we prove the absence of polynomial kernels.   For BSR, we consider programs involving t different threads. We restrict the analysis to computations where the write permission changes s times between the threads. BSR asks whether a given configuration is reachable via such an s-stage computation. When parameterized by P, the maximum size of a thread, and t, the interesting observation is that the problem has a large number of difficult instances. Formally, we show that there is no polynomial kernel, no compression algorithm that reduces the size of the data domain D or the number of stages s to a polynomial dependence on P and t. This indicates that symbolic methods may be harder to find for this problem.",18,[],7

To address the first issue, we investigate several types of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that can model both the conversation context and the current turn. We show that LSTM networks with sentence-level attention on context and current turn, as well as the conditional LSTM network (Rocktaschel et al. 2016), outperform the LSTM model that reads only the current turn.

Here we say that an edge is covered by equation iff at least one of its endpoints lies in equation.   We present an FPT approximation scheme (FPT-AS) that runs in equation time for the problem, which improves upon Gupta et al.'s equation-time FPT-AS [SODA'18, FOCS'18]. Our algorithm is simple: just use brute force to find the best equation-vertex subset among the equation vertices with maximum weighted degrees.   Our algorithm naturally yields an efficient approximate kernelization scheme of equation vertices; previously, an equation-vertex approximate kernel is only known for the unweighted version of Max equation-VC [Lokshtanov et al., STOC'17]. Interestingly, this has an application outside of parameterized complexity: using our approximate kernelization as a preprocessing step, we can directly apply Raghavendra and Tan's SDP-based algorithm for 2SAT with cardinality constraint [SODA'12] to give an equation-approximation for Max equation-VC in polynomial time. This improves upon Feige and Langberg's algorithm [J. Algorithms'01] which yields equation-approximation for some (unspecified) constant equation.   We also consider the minimization version (Min equation-VC), where the goal is to minimize the total weight of edges covered by equation.

1812.09809,cs,"Recently, the hybrid convolutional neural network hidden Markov model (CNN-HMM) has been introduced for offline handwritten Chinese text recognition (HCTR) and has achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, modeling each of the large vocabulary of Chinese characters with a uniform and fixed number of hidden states requires high memory and computational costs and makes the tens of thousands of HMM state classes confusing. Another key issue of CNN-HMM for HCTR is the diversified writing style, which leads to model strain and a significant performance decline for specific writers. To address these issues, we propose a writer-aware CNN based on parsimonious HMM (WCNN-PHMM). First, PHMM is designed using a data-driven state-tying algorithm to greatly reduce the total number of HMM states, which not only yields a compact CNN by state sharing of the same or similar radicals among different Chinese characters but also improves the recognition accuracy due to the more accurate modeling of tied states and the lower confusion among them. Second, WCNN integrates each convolutional layer with one adaptive layer fed by a writer-dependent vector, namely, the writer code, to extract the irrelevant variability in writer information to improve recognition performance. The parameters of writer-adaptive layers are jointly optimized with other network parameters in the training stage, while a multiple-pass decoding strategy is adopted to learn the writer code and generate recognition results. Validated on the ICDAR 2013 competition of CASIA-HWDB database, the more compact WCNN-PHMM of a 7360-class vocabulary can achieve a relative character error rate (CER) reduction of 16.6% over the conventional CNN-HMM without considering language modeling.

1803.10336,cs,"Neuronal cell bodies mostly reside in the cerebral cortex. The study of this thin and highly convoluted surface is essential for understanding how the brain works. The analysis of surface data is, however, challenging due to the high variability of the cortical geometry. This paper presents a novel approach for learning and exploiting surface data directly across surface domains. Current approaches rely on geometrical simplifications, such as spherical inflations, a popular but costly process. For instance, the widely used FreeSurfer takes about 3 hours to parcellate brain surfaces on a standard machine. Direct learning of surface data via graph convolutions would provide a new family of fast algorithms for processing brain surfaces. However, the current limitation of existing state-of-the-art approaches is their inability to compare surface data across different surface domains. Surface bases are indeed incompatible between brain geometries. This paper leverages recent advances in spectral graph matching to transfer surface data across aligned spectral domains. This novel approach enables a direct learning of surface data across compatible surface bases. It exploits spectral filters over intrinsic representations of surface neighborhoods. We illustrate the benefits of this approach with an application to brain parcellation. We validate the algorithm over 101 manually labeled brain surfaces. The results show a significant improvement in labeling accuracy over recent Euclidean approaches, while gaining a drastic speed improvement over conventional methods.",18,[],7

1809.10325,cs,"We consider a variation of the problem of corruption detection on networks posed by Alon, Mossel, and Pemantle '15. In this model, each vertex of a graph can be either truthful or corrupt. Each vertex reports about the types (truthful or corrupt) of all its neighbors to a central agency, where truthful nodes report the true types they see and corrupt nodes report adversarially. The central agency aggregates these reports and attempts to find a single truthful node. Inspired by real auditing networks, we pose our problem for arbitrary graphs and consider corruption through a computational lens. We identify a key combinatorial parameter of the graph equation, which is the minimal number of corrupted agents needed to prevent the central agency from identifying a single truthful node. We give an efficient (in fact, linear time) algorithm for the central agency to identify a truthful node that is successful whenever the number of corrupt nodes is less than equation. On the other hand, we prove that for any constant equation, it is NP-hard to find a subset of nodes equation in equation such that corrupting equation prevents the central agency from finding one truthful node and equation, assuming the Small Set Expansion Hypothesis (Raghavendra and Steurer, STOC '10). We conclude that being corrupt requires being clever, while detecting corruption does not.   Our main technical insight is a relation between the minimum number of corrupt nodes required to hide all truthful nodes and a certain notion of vertex separability for the underlying graph. Additionally, this insight lets us design an efficient algorithm for a corrupt party to decide which graphs require the fewest corrupted nodes, up to a multiplicative factor of equation.",18,[],7
1804.00857,cs,"Recurrent neural networks (RNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN) and self-attention networks (SAN) are commonly used to produce context-aware representations. RNN can capture long-range dependency but is hard to parallelize and not time-efficient. CNN focuses on local dependency but does not perform well on some tasks. SAN can model both such dependencies via highly parallelizable computation, but memory requirement grows rapidly in line with sequence length. In this paper, we propose a model, called ""bi-directional block self-attention network (Bi-BloSAN)"", for RNN/CNN-free sequence encoding. It requires as little memory as RNN but with all the merits of SAN. Bi-BloSAN splits the entire sequence into blocks, and applies an intra-block SAN to each block for modeling local context, then applies an inter-block SAN to the outputs for all blocks to capture long-range dependency. Thus, each SAN only needs to process a short sequence, and only a small amount of memory is required. Additionally, we use feature-level attention to handle the variation of contexts around the same word, and use forward/backward masks to encode temporal order information.

1805.10966,cs,"Artificial autonomous agents and robots interacting in complex environments are required to continually acquire and fine-tune knowledge over sustained periods of time. The ability to learn from continuous streams of information is referred to as lifelong learning and represents a long-standing challenge for neural network models due to catastrophic forgetting. Computational models of lifelong learning typically alleviate catastrophic forgetting in experimental scenarios with given datasets of static images and limited complexity, thereby differing significantly from the conditions artificial agents are exposed to. In more natural settings, sequential information may become progressively available over time and access to previous experience may be restricted. In this paper, we propose a dual-memory self-organizing architecture for lifelong learning scenarios. The architecture comprises two growing recurrent networks with the complementary tasks of learning object instances (episodic memory) and categories (semantic memory). Both growing networks can expand in response to novel sensory experience: the episodic memory learns fine-grained spatiotemporal representations of object instances in an unsupervised fashion while the semantic memory uses task-relevant signals to regulate structural plasticity levels and develop more compact representations from episodic experience. For the consolidation of knowledge in the absence of external sensory input, the episodic memory periodically replays trajectories of neural reactivations.

A widely used technique is 3D non-rigid registration to estimate the transformation between two instances of a deforming structure. Despite many previous developments on this topic, it remains a challenging problem. In this paper we propose a novel approach to non-rigid registration combining two data spaces in order to robustly calculate the correspondences and transformation between two data sets. In particular, we use point color as well as 3D location as these are the common outputs of RGB-D cameras. We have propose the Color Coherent Point Drift (CCPD) algorithm (an extension of the CPD method [1]). Evaluation is performed using synthetic and real data. The synthetic data includes easy shapes that allow evaluation of the effect of noise, outliers and missing data. Moreover, an evaluation of realistic figures obtained using Blensor is carried out. Real data acquired using a general purpose Primesense Carmine sensor is used to validate the CCPD for real shapes. For all tests, the proposed method is compared to the original CPD showing better results in registration accuracy in most cases.",18,[],7

Novel fifth generation (5G) 3GPP New Radio (NR) standard will bring a number of new opportunities for optimizing video delivery across both 5G core and radio access networks. One of the promising approaches for video quality adaptation, throughput enhancement and erasure protection is the use of packet-level random linear network coding (RLNC). In this review paper, we discuss the integration of RLNC into the 5G NR standard, building upon the ideas and opportunities identified in 4G LTE.

In order to maintain diversity throughout the process of evolution, various means exist in literature.

1803.05101,cs,"We design differentially private learning algorithms that are agnostic to the learning model. Our algorithms are interactive in nature, i.e., instead of outputting a model based on the training data, they provide predictions for a set of equation feature vectors that arrive online. We show that, for the feature vectors on which an ensemble of models (trained on random disjoint subsets of a dataset) makes consistent predictions, there is almost no-cost of privacy in generating accurate predictions for those feature vectors. To that end, we provide a novel coupling of the distance to instability framework with the sparse vector technique. We provide algorithms with formal privacy and utility guarantees for both binary/multi-class classification, and soft-label classification. For binary classification in the standard (agnostic) PAC model, we show how to bootstrap from our privately generated predictions to construct a computationally efficient private learner that outputs a final accurate hypothesis. Our construction - to the best of our knowledge - is the first computationally efficient construction for a label-private learner. We prove sample complexity upper bounds for this setting. As in non-private sample complexity bounds, the only relevant property of the given concept class is its VC dimension. For soft-label classification, our techniques are based on exploiting the stability properties of traditional learning algorithms, like stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We provide a new technique to boost the average-case stability properties of learning algorithms to strong (worst-case) stability properties, and then exploit them to obtain private classification algorithms. In the process, we also show that a large class of SGD methods satisfy average-case stability properties, in contrast to a smaller class of SGD methods that are uniformly stable as shown in prior work.",18,[],7

For this, we initially rely on an off-the-shelf deep neural network, already trained with a large amount of data, which provides a series of text hypotheses per input image. These hypotheses are then re-ranked using word frequencies and semantic relatedness with objects or scenes in the image.

1812.11837,cs,"Device-to-device (D2D) communications is expected to play a significant role in increasing the system capacity of the fifth generation (5G) wireless networks. To accomplish this, efficient power and resource allocation algorithms need to be devised for the D2D users. Since the D2D users are treated as secondary users, their interference to the cellular users (CUs) should not hamper the CU communications. Most of the prior works on D2D resource allocation assume full channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS). However, the required channel gains for the D2D pairs may not be known. To acquire these in a fast fading channel requires extra power and control overhead. In this paper, we assume partial CSI and formulate the D2D power and resource allocation problem as a multi-armed bandit problem. We propose a power allocation scheme for the D2D users in which the BS allocates power to the D2D users if a certain signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is maintained for the CUs. In a single player environment a D2D user selects a CU in every time slot by employing UCB1 algorithm. Since this resource allocation problem can also be considered as an adversarial bandit problem we have applied the exponential-weight algorithm for exploration and exploitation (Exp3) to solve it. In a multiple player environment, we extend UCB1 and Exp3 to multiple D2D users. We also propose two algorithms that are based on distributed learning algorithm with fairness (DLF) and kth-UCB1 algorithms in which the D2D users are ranked. Our simulation results show that our proposed algorithms are fair and achieve good performance.",18,[],7

In this context, dynamic Dataflow and Gamma - General Abstract Model for Multiset mAnipulation) - emerge as interesting computational models choices. In the dynamic Dataflow model, operations are performed as soon as their associated operators are available, without rely on a Program Counter to dictate the execution order of instructions. The Gamma paradigm is based on a parallel multiset rewriting scheme. It provides a non-deterministic execution model inspired by an abstract chemical machine metaphor, where operations are formulated as reactions that occur freely among matching elements belonging to the multiset. In this work, equivalence relations between the dynamic Dataflow and Gamma paradigms are exposed and explored, while methods to convert from Dataflow to Gamma paradigm and vice versa are provided. It is shown that vertices and edges of a dynamic Dataflow graph can correspond, respectively, to reactions and multiset elements in the Gamma paradigm. Implementation aspects of execution environments that could be mutually beneficial to both models are also discussed. This work provides the scientific community with the possibility of taking profit of both parallel programming models, contributing with a versatility component to researchers and developers.

1808.08438,cs,"Paraphrases, the rewordings of the same semantic meaning, are useful for improving generalization and translation. However, prior works only explore paraphrases at the word or phrase level, not at the sentence or corpus level. Unlike previous works that only explore paraphrases at the word or phrase level, we use different translations of the whole training data that are consistent in structure as paraphrases at the corpus level. We train on parallel paraphrases in multiple languages from various sources. We treat paraphrases as foreign languages, tag source sentences with paraphrase labels, and train on parallel paraphrases in the style of multilingual Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Our multi-paraphrase NMT that trains only on two languages outperforms the multilingual baselines. Adding paraphrases improves the rare word translation and increases entropy and diversity in lexical choice. Adding the source paraphrases boosts performance better than adding the target ones. Combining both the source and the target paraphrases lifts performance further; combining paraphrases with multilingual data helps but has mixed performance. We achieve a BLEU score of 57.2 for French-to-English translation using 24 corpus-level paraphrases of the Bible, which outperforms the multilingual baselines and is 34.7 above the single-source single-target NMT baseline.",18,[],7
1805.04271,cs,"A key enabler for the emerging autonomous and cooperative driving services is high-throughput and reliable Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) communication. In this respect, the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies hold great promises because of the large available bandwidth which may provide the required link capacity. However, this potential is hindered by the challenging propagation characteristics of high-frequency channels and the dynamic topology of the vehicular scenarios, which affect the reliability of the connection. Moreover, mmWave transmissions typically leverage beamforming gain to compensate for the increased path loss experienced at high frequencies. This, however, requires fine alignment of the transmitting and receiving beams, which may be difficult in vehicular scenarios. Those limitations may undermine the performance of V2N communications and pose new challenges for proper vehicular communication design. In this paper, we study by simulation the practical feasibility of some mmWave-aware strategies to support V2N, in comparison to the traditional LTE connectivity below 6 GHz. The results show that the orchestration among different radios represents a viable solution to enable both high-capacity and robust V2N communications.",18,[],7

In this paper, a RNN is trained by using as features the angles formed by the finger bones of human hands. The selected features, acquired by a Leap Motion Controller (LMC) sensor, have been chosen because the majority of human gestures produce joint movements that generate truly characteristic corners.

In this paper, we introduce an efficient method to expand the limited in-domain data. Theprocess starts with training a preliminary NLU model based on logistic regression on the in-domaindata. Since the features are based onn= 1,2-grams, we can detect the most informative n-gramsfor each intent class. Using these n-grams, we find the samples in the out-of-domain corpus that1) contain the desired n-gram and/or 2) have similar intent label. The ones which meet the firstconstraint are used to train a new LM model and the ones that meet both constraints are used to train anew NLU model. Our results on two divergent experimental setups show that the proposed approachreduces by 30% the absolute classification error rate (CER) comparing to the preliminary modelsand it significantly outperforms the traditional data expansion algorithms such as the ones based onsemi-supervised learning, TF-IDF and embedding vectors.",18,[],7
1809.10054,cs,"Given one or two examples, humans are good at understanding how to solve a problem independently of its domain, because they are able to detect what the problem is and to choose the appropriate background knowledge according to the context. For instance, presented with the string ""8/17/2017"" to be transformed to ""17th of August of 2017"", humans will process this in two steps: (1) they recognise that it is a date and (2) they map the date to the 17th of August of 2017. Inductive Programming (IP) aims at learning declarative (functional or logic) programs from examples. Two key advantages of IP are the use of background knowledge and the ability to synthesise programs from a few input/output examples (as humans do). In this paper we propose to use IP as a means for automating repetitive data manipulation tasks, frequently presented during the process of \em data wrangling in many data manipulation problems. Here we show that with the use of general-purpose declarative (programming) languages jointly with generic IP systems and the definition of domain-specific knowledge, many specific data wrangling problems from different application domains can be automatically solved from very few examples. We also propose an integrated benchmark for data wrangling, which we share publicly for the community.",18,[],7

To address this problem, we develop an update law for the non-faulty agents. Specifically, we propose a modification of the so-called Mean-Subsequence-Reduced (MSR) algorithm, the Differentially Private MSR (DP-MSR) algorithm, and characterize three important properties of the algorithm: correctness, accuracy and differential privacy. We show that if the network topology is equation-robust, then the algorithm allows the non-faulty agents to reach consensus despite the presence of up to equation faulty agents and we characterize the accuracy of the algorithm. Furthermore, we also show in two important cases that our distributed algorithm can be tuned to guarantees differential privacy of the initial conditions and the differential privacy requirement is related to the maximum network degree. The results are illustrated via simulations.",18,[],7
1803.10039,cs,"Learning depth from a single image, as an important issue in scene understanding, has attracted a lot of attention in the past decade. The accuracy of the depth estimation has been improved from conditional Markov random fields, non-parametric methods, to deep convolutional neural networks most recently. However, there exist inherent ambiguities in recovering 3D from a single 2D image. In this paper, we first prove the ambiguity between the focal length and monocular depth learning, and verify the result using experiments, showing that the focal length has a great influence on accurate depth recovery. In order to learn monocular depth by embedding the focal length, we propose a method to generate synthetic varying-focal-length dataset from fixed-focal-length datasets, and a simple and effective method is implemented to fill the holes in the newly generated images. For the sake of accurate depth recovery, we propose a novel deep neural network to infer depth through effectively fusing the middle-level information on the fixed-focal-length dataset, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods built on pre-trained VGG. Furthermore, the newly generated varying-focal-length dataset is taken as input to the proposed network in both learning and inference phases. Extensive experiments on the fixed- and varying-focal-length datasets demonstrate that the learned monocular depth with embedded focal length is significantly improved compared to that without embedding the focal length information.",18,[],7

1807.09942,cs,"Darwiche and Pearl's seminal 1997 article outlined a number of baseline principles for a logic of iterated belief revision. These principles, the DP postulates, have been supplemented in a number of alternative ways. Most of the suggestions made have resulted in a form of `reductionism' that identifies belief states with orderings of worlds. However, this position has recently been criticised as being unacceptably strong. Other proposals, such as the popular principle (P), aka `Independence', characteristic of `admissible' revision operators, remain commendably more modest. In this paper, we supplement both the DP postulates and (P) with a number of novel conditions. While the DP postulates constrain the relation between a prior and a posterior conditional belief set, our new principles notably govern the relation between two posterior conditional belief sets obtained from a common prior by different revisions. We show that operators from the resulting family, which subsumes both lexicographic and restrained revision, can be represented as relating belief states that are associated with a `proper ordinal interval' (POI) assignment, a structure more fine-grained than a simple ordering of worlds. We close the paper by noting that these operators satisfy iterated versions of a large number of AGM era postulates, including Superexpansion, that are not sound for admissible operators in general.",18,[],7

One way to allow for fewer crossings in practice are two-sided layouts that draw some edges as curves in the exterior of the circle. In fact, one- and two-sided circular layouts are equivalent to one-page and two-page book drawings, i.e., graph layouts with all vertices placed on a line (the spine) and edges drawn in one or two distinct half-planes (the pages) bounded by the spine. In this paper we study the problem of minimizing the crossings for a fixed cyclic vertex order by computing an optimal equation-plane set of exteriorly drawn edges for equation, extending the previously studied case equation. We show that this relates to finding bounded-degree maximum-weight induced subgraphs of circle graphs, which is a graph-theoretic problem of independent interest.

In particular, these equations reduce to their standard counterparts when the noncommutative (NC) parameter is switched off. By focusing on a specific branch of solutions, in contrast to standard frameworks (even with a varying BD coupling parameter), we show that we can obtain an adequate appropriate inflationary epoch possessing a suitable graceful exit. In other words, in the Jordan frame (JF), such branch of solutions properly satisfy the sufficient condition required for satisfactory inflation, which is equivalent to get an inflationary phase in the conformal Einstein frame (EF) without branch change.

In this note, we study the implications of this bound for mimetic gravity and confirm that in the original setting of the theory, GWs propagate at the speed of light, hence ensuring agreement with the recent multi-messenger detection. A higher-order extension of the original mimetic theory, appearing in the low-energy limit of projectable Ho\vrava-Lifshitz gravity, is then considered. Performing a Bayesian statistical analysis where we compare the predictions of the higher-order mimetic model for the speed of GWs against the observational bound from GW170817/GRB170817A, we derive constraints on the three free parameters of the theory.

Next, we introduce the notion of almost isolated horizons, which is weaker than the usual notion of isolated horizons, since the geometry of the former is not necessarily completely time-independent. Moreover, we allow the horizon to be pierced by strings, thereby violating the usual assumption on the spherical topology made in the definition of the weakly isolated horizon.

Due to their complexity, we currently lack ready-to-use, analytic waveforms in the Fourier domain valid for sufficiently high eccentricity, and such models are crucial to coherently extract weak signals from the noise. We here take the first steps to derive and properly validate an analytic waveform model in the Fourier domain that is valid for inspirals of arbitrary orbital eccentricity. As a proof-of-concept, we build this model to leading post-Newtonian order by combining the stationary phase approximation, a truncated sum of harmonics, and an analytic representation of hypergeometric functions. Through comparisons with numerical post-Newtonian waveforms, we determine how many harmonics are required for a faithful (matches above 99%) representation of the signal up to orbital eccentricities as large as 0.9. As a first byproduct of this analysis, we present a novel technique to maximize the match of eccentric signals over time of coalescence and phase at coalescence. As a second byproduct, we determine which of the different approximations we employ leads to the largest loss in match, which could be used to systematically improve the model because of our analytic control.

Since long ago, the physical interpretation of the linear fluctuations in the metric of spherically symmetric black holes has been established. In a multipolar expansion, it is known that polar perturbations of a monopole type (equation) can only increase the black-hole mass, axial perturbations of a dipole type (equation) induce a slow rotation in the system, and perturbations with equation always lead to the production of gravitational waves. However, in relation to the planar Schwarzschild anti--de Sitter black holes (or black branes, for short), there is still no conclusive study on some aspects of the physical meaning of these perturbations. In particular, there is some controversy concerning the polar sector of fluctuations with zero wave number equation. Some authors claim that this kind of perturbations causes only a variation in the black-brane mass parameter, while others obtained also evidence for the existence of gravitational waves associated to such modes. The present study aims to contribute to the resolution of this controversy by revealing the physical meaning of the gravitational perturbations of anti--de Sitter black branes. In this work we use the Chandrasekhar's gauge formalism to evaluate the linear variations in the complex Weyl scalars in terms of the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli gauge-invariant quantities.

Specifically, the role that spin may play with respect to energy condition violation is considered. It turns out that with the addition of spin, the torsion terms in Einstein-Cartan gravity do allow for energy condition respecting warp drives. Limits are derived which minimize the amount of spin required in order to have a weak/null-energy condition respecting system. This is done both for the traditional Alcubierre warp drive as well as for the modified warp drive of Van Den Broeck which minimizes the amount of matter required for the drive. The ship itself is in a region of effectively vacuum and hence the torsion, which in Einstein-Cartan theory is localized in matter, does not affect the geodesic nature of the ship's trajectory.

1803.04802,gr-qc,"We perform fully non-linear numerical simulations within the spherically symmetric Einstein-(complex)Proca system. Starting with Proca field distributions that obey the Hamiltonian, momentum and Gaussian constraints, we show that the self-gravity of the system induces the formation of compact objects, which, for appropriate initial conditions, asymptotically approach stationary soliton-like solutions known as Proca stars. The excess energy of the system is dissipated by the mechanism of \textitgravitational cooling in analogy to what occurs in the dynamical formation of scalar boson stars. We investigate the dependence of this process on the phase difference between the real and imaginary parts of the Proca field, as well as on their relative amplitudes. Within the timescales probed by our numerical simulations the process is qualitatively insensitive to either choice: the phase difference and the amplitude ratio are conserved during the evolution. Thus, whereas a truly stationary object is expected to be approached only in the particular case of equal amplitudes and opposite phases, quasi-stationary compact solitonic objects are, nevertheless, formed in the general case.",18,[],13

In this way, the Riemann curvature is split into the temporal and spatial part, i.e. Gauss, Codazzi, and Ricci relation. Finally, the splitting of the Einstein equation is achieved by contraction. Choosing congruence as normal to a spacelike hypersurface, the formalism reduces to 31 formalism. This approach deepens our understanding of 31 formalism.

Time evolution of scalar perturbations is studied for different parameters associated with the black hole solution. We also study the reflection and transmission coefficients along with absorption cross-section for the considered black hole spacetime. It was shown that the real part of quasinormal frequency increases with increase in nonlinear magnetic charge while the module of the imaginary part of the frequency decreases.

1809.03483,gr-qc,"We point out that the symplectic structure, written in terms of the Sen-Ashtekar-Immirzi-Barbero variables, of a spacetime admitting an isolated horizon as the inner boundary, involves a positive constant parameter, say equation, if equation, where equation is the Barbero-Immirzi parameter. The parameter equation represents the rescaling freedom that characterizes the equivalence class of null generators of the isolated horizon. We reiterate the fact that the laws of mechanics associated with the isolated horizon does not depend on the choice of equation and, in particular, while one uses the value of standard surface gravity as input, that does not fix equation to a particular value. This fact contradicts the claims made in certain parts of the concerned literature that we duly refer to. We do the calculations by taking Schwarzschild metric as an example so that the contradiction with the referred literature, where similar approaches were adopted, becomes apparent. The contribution to the symplectic structure that comes from the isolated horizon, diverges for equation, implying that the rescaling symmetry of the isolated horizon is violated for any real equation. Since the quantum theory of equation isolated horizon in the LQG framework exists only for real values of equation, it is founded on this flawed classical setup. Nevertheless, if the flaw is ignored, then two different viewpoints persist in the literature for entropy calculation. We highlight the main features of those approaches and point out why one is logically viable and the other is not.",18,[],13

To that end we consider a star that is spherically symmetric, dark and non-transparent and we assume that it begins, at some instant of time, to collapse in free fall like a ball of dust.

The transverse momentum and mass responses in simulations are found to be about 2-3% higher than in data. This difference is adjusted for with a correction factor. The results of the different methods are combined to yield a calibration over a large range of transverse momenta (equation).

1811.01499,hep-ph,"The precision study of equation production with subsequent equation and equation decays at the LHC can help us to study the Higgs gauge couplings and to search for new physics beyond the SM. In this paper, we calculate the shower-matched NLO QCD correction and the EW corrections from the equation annihilation and photon-induced channels to the equation production at the equation LHC, and deal with the subsequent decays of Higgs and equation bosons by adopting the \sc MadSpin method. Both the integrated cross section and some kinematic distributions of equation, equation and their decay products are provided. We find that the QCD correction enhances the LO differential cross section significantly, while the EW correction from the equation annihilation channel obviously suppresses the LO differential cross section, especially in the high energy phase-space region due to the Sudakov effect. The equation- and equation-induced relative corrections are positive, and insensitive to the transverse momenta of equation, equation and their decay products. These photon-induced corrections compensate the negative equation-initiated EW correction, and become the dominant EW contribution as the increment of the equation colliding energy. The parton shower (PS) effects on the kinematic distributions are nonnegligible. The PS relative correction to the equation-jet transverse momentum distribution can exceed equation in the high equation region.

1812.11154,hep-ph,"We consider theories in which the generation of neutrino masses is associated with the breaking of an approximate global lepton number symmetry. In such a scenario the spectrum of light states includes the Majoron, the pseudo-Nambu Goldstone boson associated with the breaking of the global symmetry. For a broad range of parameters, the Majoron decays to neutrinos at late times, after the cosmic neutrinos have decoupled from the thermal bath, resulting in a secondary contribution to the cosmic neutrino background. We determine the current bounds on this scenario, and explore the possibility of directly detecting this secondary cosmic neutrino background in experiments based on neutrino capture on nuclei. For Majoron masses in the eV range or below, the neutrino flux from these decays can be comparable to that from the primary cosmic neutrino background, making it a promising target for direct detection experiments. The neutrinos from Majoron decay are redshifted by the cosmic expansion, and exhibit a characteristic energy spectrum that depends on both the Majoron mass and its lifetime. For Majoron lifetimes of order the age of the universe or larger, there is also a monochromatic contribution to the neutrino flux from Majoron decays in the Milky Way that can be comparable to the diffuse extragalactic flux. We find that for Majoron masses in the eV range, direct detection experiments based on neutrino capture on tritium, such as PTOLEMY, will be sensitive to this scenario with 100 gram-years of data.

We estimate this cross section in a simple toy model. The dominant process can be viewed as a rearrangement of the heavy and light quarks, leading to a geometric cross section of hadronic size. In contrast, processes in which only the heavy constituents are involved lead to mass-suppressed cross sections. These results apply to any scenario with bound states of sizes much larger than their inverse mass, such as U(1) models with charged particles of different masses, and can be used to construct ultra-heavy dark-matter models with masses above the na\""ive unitarity bound.

The subsequent deviations from the standard mixing scheme are calculable in terms of the equation mass. While these deviations for (i) equation, (ii) equation, and (iii) equation are all within present experimental errors so long as equation TeV, they should soon be detectable if the equation mass is not too much bigger; [III] suggests that in parallel to the standard sector familiar to us, there is another where the roles of flavour and colour are interchanged.

The masses of the vector KK modes equation contain two parts, equation and equation, due to the existence of the two extra dimensions. The masses of the two types of scalar KK modes equation and equation are related to the vector ones, i.e., equation and equation.

1806.00456,hep-th,"Using a recent strategy to encode the space of flat connections on a three-manifold with string-like defects into the space of flat connections on a so-called 2d Heegaard surface, we propose a novel way to define gauge invariant bases for (31)d lattice gauge theories and gauge models of topological phases. In particular, this method reconstructs the spin network basis and yields a novel dual spin network basis. While the spin network basis allows to interpret states in terms of electric excitations, on top of a vacuum sharply peaked on a vanishing electric field, the dual spin network basis describes magnetic (or curvature) excitations, on top of a vacuum sharply peaked on a vanishing magnetic field (or flat connection). This technique is also applicable for manifolds with boundaries. We distinguish in particular a dual pair of boundary conditions, namely of electric type and of magnetic type.

The critical doping at which excitations becomes long lived increases with temperature. The emerging phase diagram is qualitatively similar to that of High Temperature Superconductors.",18,[],4
1810.07741,hep-th,We consider the Steiner tree problem in hyperbolic geometry in the context of the AdS/CFT duality between large-equation conformal blocks on the boundary and particle motions in the bulk. The Steiner trees are weighted graphs on the Poincare disk with a number of endpoints and trivalent vertices connected to each other by edges in such a way that an overall length is minimum. We specify a particular class of Steiner trees that we call holographic. Their characteristic property is that a holographic Steiner tree with equation endpoints can be inscribed into an equation-gon with equation ideal vertices. The holographic Steiner trees are dual to large-equation conformal blocks. Particular examples of equation Steiner trees as well as their dual conformal blocks are explicitly calculated. We discuss geometric properties of the holographic Steiner trees and their realization in CFT terms. It is shown that connectivity and cuts of the Steiner trees encode the factorization properties of large-equation conformal blocks.,18,[],4

We conjecture the same is true even when imposing more general soft behavior, simply by assuming the existence of soft operators, or by imposing gauge invariance/the Adler zero only up to a finite order in soft expansions. Besides reproducing known amplitudes, this analysis reveals a new higher order correction to the NLSM, and two interesting facts: the subleading theorem for the dilaton, and the subsubleading theorem for DBI follow automatically from the more leading theorems.

A different boundary condition, in which one specifies the conformal geometry of the boundary and the trace of the extrinsic curvature, is elliptic and always leads formally to a satisfactory perturbation theory.

1807.01578,hep-th,"This paper extends the formalism for quantizing field theories via a microcanonical quantum field theory and Hamilton's principle to classical evolution equations. These are based on the well-known correspondence under a Wick rotation between quantum field theories and 4-D statistical mechanical theories. By placing quantum field theories on a 41-D under Wick rotation to 5-D, expectations of observables are calculated for a microcanonical field theory averaging Hamiltonian flow over a fifth spacelike dimension, a technique common in lattice gauge simulations but not in perturbation theory. In a novel demonstration, averaging pairs of external lines in the classical Feynman diagrams over the fifth dimension generates diagrams with loops and vacuum fluctuations identical to Standard Model diagrams. Because it is microcanonical, this approach, while equivalent for standard quantum fields theories in the Standard Model, is able to quantize theories that have no canonical quantization. It is also unique in representing expectations as averages over solutions to an ordinary, classical PDE rather than a path integral or operator based approaches. Hence, this approach draws a clear connection between quantum field theory and classical field theory in higher dimensions which has implications towards how quantum effects are interpreted. In particular, it raises questions about how violations of the ergodic hypothesis could influence quantum measurements even in standard, non-statistical quantum field theory.",18,[],4

In this paper the simplest gauge matrix model of two free matrices, that has Hagedorn behavior is analyzed in detail. A simple double trace deformation of the Hamiltonian, proportional to square of the free Hamiltonian square with a negative sign that mimics a gravitational attraction is enough to produce states with negative specific heat perturbatively and one can still compute the equation of state relating the entropy and the energy.

The finiteness of these limits is checked explicitly for free scalar, fermion, and vector CFTs.

In the case that two strips are in the two boundaries of the spacetime respectively, we find that the holographic EoP exists only when the strips are wide enough. If the width is finite, the EoP can be nonzero in a finite time region.

These relations provide consistency conditions on the coefficients, and when combined with the `square' rule, prove sufficient to fix the answer to ten loops. We then proceed to study the correlator/amplitude duality by taking six and seven adjacent points of the four-point correlator to be light-like separated. A conformal basis (with rational coefficients) is used to extract amplitude integrands for both six and seven particles up to two loops - more precisely, the complete one-loop amplitude and parity-even two-loop amplitude (at two loops, we use a refined prescriptive basis).

This permission usually makes the counterterms position-dependent. Along with the renormalization program, a supplementary regularization technique was performed in this work. In this regularization technique, that we have named Box Subtraction Scheme (BSS), two similar configurations were introduced and the zero point energies of these two configurations were subtracted from each other using appropriate limits. This regularization procedure makes the usage of any analytic continuation techniques unnecessary.

1802.01585,hep-th,"The positivity of relative entropy for spatial subsystems in a holographic CFT implies the positivity of certain quantities in the dual gravitational theory. In this note, we consider CFT subsystems whose boundaries lie on the lightcone of a point equation. We show that the positive gravitational quantity which corresponds to the relative entropy for such a subsystem equation is a novel notion of energy associated with a gravitational subsystem bounded by the minimal area extremal surface equation associated with equation and by the AdS boundary region equation corresponding to the part of the lightcone from equation bounded by equation. This generalizes the results of arXiv:1605.01075 for ball-shaped regions by making use of the recent results in arXiv:1703.10656 for the vacuum modular Hamiltonian of regions bounded on lightcones. As part of our analysis, we give an analytic expression for the extremal surface in pure AdS associated with any such region equation. We note that its form immediately implies the Markov property of the CFT vacuum (saturation of strong subadditivity) for regions bounded on the same lightcone. This gives a holographic proof of the result proven for general CFTs in arXiv:1703.10656. A similar holographic proof shows the Markov property for regions bounded on a lightsheet for non-conformal holographic theories defined by relevant perturbations of a CFT.",18,[],4

This means that the reduced density matrix can be approximated as proportional to the identity to the extent that its Renyi entropies equation are independent of equation at this order. The equation-dependence of equation in more general states then arises from sums over the RT/HRT-area, which are generally dominated by different values of this area for each equation. This provides a simple picture of gravitational entanglement, bolsters the connection between holographic systems and tensor network models, clarifies the bulk interpretation of algebraic centers which arise in the quantum error-correcting description of holography, and strengthens the connection between bulk and boundary modular Hamiltonians described by Jafferis, Lewkowycz, Maldacena, and Suh.",18,[],4

Although the theories under consideration are not renormalizable, the extended supersymmetry essentially improves the ultraviolet behavior of the lowest-order loops. The equation supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory turns out to be finite in the one-loop approximation in the minimal gauge. Also some two-loop divergences are shown to be absent in this theory. Analysis of the divergences is performed both in terms of harmonic supergraphs and by the manifestly gauge covariant superfield proper-time method.

Therefore, we can argue whether each multiplet included in the theory is effectively massless in this limit, even on equation, and conclude that the partition function becomes that of the effective theory on the specific point of the Coulomb branch in the infinite mass limit. In order to investigate which point of the Coulomb branch is dominant, we use the saddle point approximation in the large equation limit because the solution of the saddle point equation can be regarded as a specific point of the Coulomb branch.

1804.10526,math,"High order strong stability preserving (SSP) time discretizations are often needed to ensure the nonlinear (and sometimes non-inner-product) strong stability properties of spatial discretizations specially designed for the solution of hyperbolic PDEs. Multiderivative time-stepping methods have recently been increasingly used for evolving hyperbolic PDEs, and the strong stability properties of these methods are of interest. In our prior work we explored time discretizations that preserve the strong stability properties of spatial discretizations coupled with forward Euler and a second derivative formulation. However, many spatial discretizations do not satisfy strong stability properties when coupled with this second derivative formulation, but rather with a more natural Taylor series formulation. In this work we demonstrate sufficient conditions for an explicit two-derivative multistage method to preserve the strong stability properties of spatial discretizations in a forward Euler and Taylor series formulation. We call these strong stability preserving Taylor series (SSP-TS) methods. We also prove that the maximal order of SSP-TS methods is p = 6, and define an optimization procedure that allows us to find such SSP methods. Several types of these methods are presented and their efficiency compared. Finally, these methods are tested on several PDEs to demonstrate the benefit of SSP-TS methods, the need for the SSP property, and the sharpness of the SSP time-step in many cases.",18,[],0

1808.02179,math,"We prove that not every metric space embeds coarsely into an Alexandrov space of nonpositive curvature. This answers a question of Gromov (1993) and is in contrast to the fact that any metric space embeds coarsely into an Alexandrov space of nonnegative curvature, as shown by Andoni, Naor and Neiman (2015). We establish this statement by proving that a metric space which is equation-barycentric for some equation has metric cotype equation with sharp scaling parameter. Our proof utilizes nonlinear (metric space-valued) martingale inequalities and yields sharp bounds even for some classical Banach spaces. This allows us to evaluate the bi-Lipschitz distortion of the equation grid equation into equation for all equation, from which we deduce the following discrete converse to the fact that equation embeds with distortion equation into equation for equation. A rigidity theorem of Ribe (1976) implies that for every equation there exists equation such that if equation embeds into equation with distortion equation, then equation is necessarily at least a universal constant multiple of equation. Ribe's theorem does not give an explicit upper bound on this equation, but by the work of Bourgain (1987) it suffices to take equation, and this was the previously best-known estimate for equation.

The model of interest couples the Richards equation with linear elasticity equations, employing the equivalent pore pressure. In practice a monolithic solver is not always available, defining the requirement for a linearization scheme to allow the use of separate simulators, which is not met by the classical Newton method. We propose three different linearization schemes incorporating the fixed-stress splitting scheme, coupled with an L-scheme, Modified Picard and Newton linearization of the flow. All schemes allow the efficient and robust decoupling of mechanics and flow equations. In particular, the simplest scheme, the Fixed-Stress-L-scheme, employs solely constant diagonal stabilization, has low cost per iteration, and is very robust. Under mild, physical assumptions, it is theoretically shown to be a contraction. Due to possible break-down or slow convergence of all considered splitting schemes, Anderson acceleration is applied as post-processing. Based on a special case, we justify theoretically the general ability of the Anderson acceleration to effectively accelerate convergence and stabilize the underlying scheme, allowing even non-contractive fixed-point iterations to converge. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical indication of this kind. Theoretical findings are confirmed by numerical results. In particular, Anderson acceleration has been demonstrated to be very effective for the considered Picard-type methods.

1805.09589,nlin,"In this paper we introduce preHamiltonian pairs of difference operators and study their connections with Nijenhuis operators and the existence of weakly non-local inverse recursion operators for differential-difference equations.

In particular, we give a criteria for a rational operator to be weakly non--local. A difference operator equation is called preHamiltonian, if its image is a Lie equation-subalgebra with respect the the Lie bracket on equation. Two preHamiltonian operators form a preHamiltonian pair if any equation-linear combination of them is preHamiltonian. Then we show that a preHamiltonian pair naturally leads to a Nijenhuis operator, and a Nijenhuis operator can be represented in terms of a preHamiltonian pair. This provides a systematical method to check whether a rational operator is Nijenhuis. As an application, we construct a preHamiltonian pair and thus a Nijenhuis recursion operator for the differential-difference equation recently discovered by Adler \& Postnikov. The Nijenhuis operator obtained is not weakly non-local. We prove that it generates an infinite hierarchy of local commuting symmetries.

Games in which the players do not have an identical strategy set are hypergames. Studies of hypergame dynamics have been scarce, especially those on networks. We investigate evolutionary hypergame dynamics on regular lattices using a prototypical model of three available strategies, in which the strategy set of each player contains two of the three strategies. Our computations reveal that more complex dynamical phases emerge from the system than those from the traditional evolutionary game dynamics with full knowledge of the complete set of available strategies, which include single-strategy absorption phases, a cyclic competition (`rock-paper-scissors') type of phase, and an uncertain phase in which the dominant strategy adopted by the population is unpredictable. Exploiting the pair interaction and mean field approximations, we obtain a qualitative understanding of the emergence of the single strategy and uncertain phases. We find the striking phenomenon of strategy revival associated with the cyclic competition phase and provide a qualitative explanation.Our work demonstrates that the diversity in the individuals' strategy set can play an important role in the evolution of strategy distribution in the system.

Consequently, the distribution of chimera states can remain invariant by a parameter change, as well as it can suffer subtle changes when one of the basin ceases to exist. A similar phenomenon is observed when perturbations are applied in the initial conditions. By means of the uncertainty exponent, we characterise the basin boundaries between the coherent and chimera states, and between the incoherent and chimera states, and uncover fractal and riddled boundaries, respectively. This way, we show that the density of chimera states can be not only moderately sensitive but also highly sensitive to initial conditions. This chimera's dilemma is a consequence of the fractal and riddled nature of the basins boundaries.",18,[],9

1807.02675,nlin,"Fractal structures pervade nature and are receiving increasing engineering attention towards the realization of broadband resonators and antennas. We show that fractal resonators can support the emergence of high-dimensional chaotic dynamics even in the context of an elementary, single-transistor oscillator circuit. Sierpi\'nski gaskets of variable depth are constructed using discrete capacitors and inductors, whose values are scaled according to a simple sequence. It is found that in regular fractals of this kind each iteration effectively adds a conjugate pole/zero pair, yielding gradually more complex and broader frequency responses, which can also be implemented as much smaller Foster equivalent networks. The resonators are instanced in the circuit as one-port devices, replacing the inductors found in the initial version of the oscillator. By means of a highly simplified numerical model, it is shown that increasing the fractal depth elevates the dimension of the chaotic dynamics, leading to high-order hyperchaos. This result is overall confirmed by SPICE simulations and experiments, which however also reveal that the non-ideal behavior of physical components hinders obtaining high-dimensional dynamics. The issue could be practically mitigated by building the Foster equivalent networks rather than the verbatim fractals. Furthermore, it is shown that considerably more complex resonances, and consequently richer dynamics, can be obtained by rendering the fractal resonators irregular through reshuffling the inductors, or even by inserting a limited number of focal imperfections. The present results draw attention to the potential usefulness of fractal resonators for generating high-dimensional chaotic dynamics, and underline the importance of irregularities and component non-idealities.",18,[],9

One important behaviour of such systems reveals splitting of the network into clusters of oscillators with the same frequencies, where different clusters correspond to different frequencies. Starting from one-cluster solutions we provide existence criteria for multi-cluster solutions and present their explicit form. The phases of the oscillators within one cluster can be organized in different patterns: antipodal, double antipodal, and splay type. Interestingly, multi-clusters are shown to exist where different clusters exhibit different patterns. For instance, an antipodal cluster can coexist with a splay cluster. We also provide stability conditions for one- and multi-cluster solutions. These conditions, in particular, reveal a high level of multistability.",18,[],9
1807.06340,nlin,"For a Chaplygin sleigh moving in the presence of weak friction, we present and investigate two mechanisms of arising acceleration due to oscillations of an internal mass. In certain parameter regions, the mechanism induced by small oscillations determines acceleration which is on average one-directional. The role of friction is that the velocity reached in the process of the acceleration is stabilized at a certain level. The second mechanism is due to the effect of parametric excitation of oscillations, when the internal moving particle is comparable in mass with the main platform, and, as occurs, a necessary condition for the acceleration is presence of friction. The parametric instability and the resulting acceleration of the sleigh turn out to be bounded if the line of oscillations of the moving mass is displaced from the center of mass. The steady-state regime of motion is in many cases associated with a chaotic attractor; accordingly, the motion of the sleigh turns out to be similar to the process of random walk on a plane.",18,[],9
1806.07766,nlin,"Chaotic scattering in open Hamiltonian systems is a topic of fundamental interest in physics, which has been mainly studied in the purely conservative case. However, the effect of weak perturbations in this kind of systems has been an important focus of interest in the last decade. In a previous work, the authors studied the effects of a periodic forcing in the decay law of the survival probability, and they characterized the global properties of escape dynamics. In the present paper, we add two important issues in the effects of periodic forcing: the fractal dimension of the set of singularities in the scattering function, and the unpredictability of the exit basins, which is estimated by using the concept of basin entropy. Both the fractal dimension and the basin entropy exhibit a resonant-like decrease as the forcing frequency increases. We provide a theoretical reasoning, which could justify this decreasing in the fractality near the main resonant frequency, that appears for equation. We attribute the decrease in the basin entropy to the reduction of the area occupied by the KAM islands and the basin boundaries when the frequency is close to the resonance. Finally, the decay rate of the exponential decay law shows a minimum value of the amplitude, equation, which reflects the complete destruction of the KAM islands in the resonance. We expect that this work could be potentially useful in research fields related to chaotic Hamiltonian pumps, oscillations in chemical reactions and companion galaxies, among others.",18,[],9
1801.03282,nlin,"We examine the role of long--range interactions on the dynamical and statistical properties of two 1D lattices with on--site potentials that are known to support discrete breathers: the Klein--Gordon (KG) lattice which includes linear dispersion and the Gorbach--Flach (GF) lattice, which shares the same on--site potential but its dispersion is purely nonlinear. In both models under the implementation of long--range interactions (LRI) we find that single--site excitations lead to special low--dimensional solutions, which are well described by the undamped Duffing oscillator. For random initial conditions we observe that the maximal Lyapunov exponent equation %: (a) tends to a positive value for KG and grows like equation for GF as the energy density equation increases; (b) saturates to a positive value as the number of particles equation increase, scales as equation in the KG model and as equation in the GF with LRI, suggesting in that case an approach to integrable behavior towards the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, under LRI, their non-Gaussian momentum distributions are distinctly different from those of the FPU model.",18,[],9
1805.07699,nlin,"The synchronization behavior of networked chaotic oscillators with periodic coupling is investigated. It is observed in simulations that the network synchronizability could be significantly influenced by tuning the coupling frequency, even making the network alternated between the synchronous and non-synchronous states. By the method of master stability function, we conduct a detailed analysis on the influence of coupling frequency on network synchronizability, and find that the network synchronizability is maximized at some characteristic frequencies comparable to the intrinsic frequency of the local dynamics. Moremore, it is found that as the amplitude of the coupling increases, the characteristic frequencies are gradually decreased. By the technique of finite-time Lyapunov exponent, we investigate further the mechanism for the maximized synchronizability, and find that at the characteristic frequencies the power spectrum of the finite-time Lyapunov exponent is abruptly changed from the localized to broad distributions. When this feature is absent or not prominent, the network synchronizability is less influenced by the periodic coupling. Our study shows the efficiency of finite-time Lyapunov exponent in exploring the synchronization behavior of temporally coupled oscillators, and sheds lights on the interplay between the system dynamics and structure in the general temporal networks.",18,[],9

For times larger than a transient time equation this pulse moves with the speed of light (or Fermi velocity in Weyl semimetals), effectively featuring linear wave dynamics and maintaining its shape (both in two and three dimensions). We show that for the considered nonlinearity, this pulse represents an exact solution of the nonlinear Weyl (NLW) equation.

1805.03510,nlin,"Synchronization commonly occurs in many natural and man-made systems, from neurons in the brain to cardiac cells to power grids to Josephson junction arrays. Transitions to or out of synchrony for coupled oscillators depend on several factors, such as individual frequencies, coupling, interaction time delays and network structure-function relation. Here, using a generalized Kuramoto model of time-delay coupled phase oscillators with frequency-weighted coupling, we study the stability of incoherent and coherent states and the transitions to or out of explosive (abrupt, first-order like) phase synchronization. We analytically derive the exact formulas for the critical coupling strengths at different time delays in both directions of increasing (forward) and decreasing (backward) coupling strengths. We find that time-delay does not affect the transition for the backward direction but shifts the transition for the forward direction of increasing coupling strength. These results provide valuable insights into our understanding of dynamical mechanisms for explosive synchronization in presence of often unavoidable time delays present in many physical and biological systems.",18,[],9

In this paper, we propose a particle filtering (PF) framework as a way to assess observability properties of a dynamical network, where each node is composed by an individual dynamical system. The PF framework is applied on two benchmarks, networks of Kuramoto and Rossler oscillators, to investigate how the interplay between dynamics and topology impacts the network observability. Based on the numerical results, we conjecture that, when the network nodal dynamics are heterogeneous, better observability is conveyed for sets of sensor nodes that share some dynamical affinity to its neighbourhood. Moreover, we also investigate how the choice of an internal measured variable of a multidimensional sensor node affects the PF performance. The PF framework effectiveness as an observability measure is compared to a well-consolidated nonlinear observability metric for a small network case and some chaotic systems benchmarks.",18,[],9

1809.08553,nlin,We suggest a method for calculation of parameters of dispersive shock waves in framework of Whitham modulation theory applied to non-integrable wave equations with a wide class of initial conditions corresponding to propagation of a pulse into a medium at rest. The method is based on universal applicability of Whitham's `number of waves conservation law' as well as on the conjecture of applicability of its soliton counterpart to the above mentioned class of initial conditions which is substantiated by comparison with similar situations in the case of completely integrable wave equations. This allows one to calculate the limiting characteristic velocities of the Whitham modulation equations at the boundary with the smooth part of the pulse whose evolution obeys the dispersionless approximation equations. We show that explicit analytic expressions can be obtained for laws of motion of the edges.

We see a bifurcation occurring in nonautonomous finite-time systems that cannot be identified by classical methods for infinite-time autonomous systems. Thirdly, even when a time-varying model can be extended to infinite time, the classical infinite-time approach is likely to miss dynamical phenomena that are more readily understood within the framework of finite-time dynamics.

If the higher-order breather is constructed out of constituent first-order breathers with commensurate periods (i.e., as higher-order harmonic waves), then one obtains ""quasi-periodic"" breathers with distorted side-peaks. Fully periodic breathers are obtained when their wave numbers are harmonic multiples of the background and of each other. They are truly rare, requiring finely tuned parameters.

Below a specific energy crossover, both times are found to scale exponentially as an inverse power of the specific energy.

Switching Surfaces are established as a part of fluctuating acceleration. The final system of three equation-order linear differential equations does not contain a stochastic term, so the system generates motion in a deterministic way. Nevertheless, from the time series analysis, we found that the behavior of the system exhibits statistics properties of Brownian motion, such as, a linear growth in time of the mean square displacement, a Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, we use the detrended fluctuation analysis to prove the Brownian character of this motion.",18,[],9
1805.06644,nlin,"In this paper we analyze local structure of several chaotic attractors recently suggested in literature as pseudohyperbolic. The absence of tangencies and thus the presence of the pseudohyperbolicity is verified using the method of angles that includes computation of distributions of the angles between the corresponding tangent subspaces. Also we analyze how volume expansion in the first subspace and the contraction in the second one occurs locally. For this purpose we introduce a family of instant Lyapunov exponents. Unlike the well known finite time ones, the instant Lyapunov exponents show expansion or contraction on infinitesimal time intervals. Two types of instant Lyapunov exponents are defined. One is related to ordinary finite time Lyapunov exponents computed in the course of standard algorithm for Lyapunov exponents. Their sums reveal instant volume expanding properties. The second type of instant Lyapunov exponents shows how covariant Lyapunov vectors grow or decay on infinitesimal time. Using both instant and finite time Lyapunov exponents we demonstrate that specific to the pseudohyperbolicity average expanding and contracting properties are typically violated on infinitesimal time. Instantly volumes from the first subspace can sometimes be contacted, directions in the second subspace can sometimes be expanded, and the instant contraction in the first subspace can sometimes be stronger than the contraction in the second subspace.",18,[],9
1806.04126,nlin,"This paper proposes a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process on a traveling lane, which is equipped with a queueing system and functions of site assignments along the parking lane. In the proposed system, new particles arrive at the rear of the queue existing at the leftmost site of the system. A particle at the head of the queue selects one of the empty sites in the parking lane and reserves it for stopping at once during its travel. The arriving time and staying time in the parking sites follow half-normal distributions. The random selections of empty sites are controlled by the bias of the exponential function. Our simulation results show the unique shape of site usage distributions. In addition, the number of reserved sites is found to increase with an S-shape curve as the bias to the rightmost site increases. To describe this phenomena, we propose an approximation model, which is derived from the birth-death process and extreme order statistics. A queueing model that takes the effect of distance from the leftmost site of the traveling lane into consideration is further proposed. Our approximation model properly describes the distributions of site usage, and the proposed queueing model shows good agreement with the simulation results.",18,[],9

1802.01622,nlin,"The Baker-Akhiezer (BA) function theory was successfully developed in the mid 1970s. This theory brought very interesting and important results in the spectral theory of almost periodic operators and theory of completely integrable nonlinear equations such as Korteweg-de Vries equation, nonlinear Schrodinger equation, sine-Gordon equation, Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation. Subsequently the theory was reproduced for the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) hierarchies. However, extensions of the Baker-Akhiezer function for the Maxwell-Bloch (MB) system or for the Karpman-Kaup equations, which contain prescribed weight functions characterizing inhomogeneous broadening of the main frequency, are unknown. The main goal of the paper is to give a such of extension associated with the Maxwell-Bloch equations. Using different Riemann-Hilbert problems posed on the complex plane with a finite number of cuts we propose such a matrix function that has unit determinant and takes an explicit form through Cauchy integrals, hyperelliptic integrals and theta functions. The matrix BA function solves the AKNS equations (the Lax pair for MB system) and generates a quasi-periodic finite-gap solution to the Maxwell-Bloch equations. The suggested function will be useful in the study of the long time asymptotic behavior of solutions of different initial-boundary value problems for the MB equations using the Deift-Zhou method of steepest descent and for an investigation of rogue waves of the Maxwell-Bloch equations.",18,[],9

By using this method, information channels and channels' intersections can be shown. By observing these two features, potential universal cellular automata are classified into a certain class, and all elementary cellular automata can be classified into four groups, which correspond to S.

That is the first time that this kind of diagram is built for this kind of oscillator under biphasics perturbations. Results show that biphasic perturbations have no effect when the coupling time is chosen over a wide range of values. This modifies the bifurcation diagram obtain under monophasics perturbations.

The generalized KdV cnoidal wave solutions satisfying both the evolution as well as the potential equations is obtained and the multi-cnoidal components are extracted from the regular and singular potential components. Current technique for construction of superposed cnoidal waves is the immidiate generalization of the N-soliton solution for KdV using the Backlund transformation proceedure. Quite analogous to the linear effect, the nonlinear beating is observed to exist also for nonlinear superposition of two cnoidal waves. It is further found that the nonlinear superposition of cnoidal wave with a soliton alters the whole periodic wave pattern declining the amplitude of the soliton significantly. In a three-wave nonlinear interaction of cnoidal waves it is remarked that introduction of extra cnoidal wave tends to destroy the beating pattern formed by the two of them. Furthermore, the superposition of two solitons with a cnoidal wave results in only one soliton hump traveling with the smaller soliton speed in the periodic background and with the other soliton disappeared.

1804.07444,nlin,"Synchronisation of coupled oscillators is a ubiquitous phenomenon, occurring in topics ranging from biology and physics, to social networks and technology. A fundamental and long-time goal in the study of synchronisation has been to find low-order descriptions of complex oscillator networks and their collective dynamics. However, for the Kuramoto model - the most widely used model of coupled oscillators - this goal has remained surprisingly challenging, in particular for finite-size networks. Here, we propose a model reduction framework that effectively captures synchronisation behaviour in complex network topologies. This framework generalises a collective coordinates approach for all-to-all networks [Gottwald (2015) Chaos 25, 053111] by incorporating the graph Laplacian matrix in the collective coordinates. We first derive low dimensional evolution equations for both clustered and non-clustered oscillator networks.

We consider four cases, regarding the value of the oblateness coefficient which determines the nature of the roots (attractors) of the system. For all cases we use the iterative schemes for performing a thorough and systematic classification of the nodes on the complex plane. The distribution of the iterations as well as the probability and their correlations with the corresponding basins of convergence are also discussed. Our numerical computations indicate that most of the iterative schemes provide relatively similar convergence structures on the complex plane. However, there are some numerical methods for which the corresponding basins of attraction are extremely complicated with highly fractal basin boundaries. Moreover, it is proved that the efficiency strongly varies between the numerical methods.",18,[],9

We show that multiple spatially localized solutions may exist, and the resulting bifurcation diagram strongly resembles the snaking pattern observed in a variety of fields in physics, such as optics and fluid dynamics. Moreover, in the transition from the linear to the nonlinear behaviour isolated branches of solutions are identified. Localization is caused by the hardening effect introduced by the nonlinear stiffness, and occurs at large excitation levels.

1810.06902,nlin,"In systems of N coupled anharmonic oscillators, exact resonant interactions play an important role in the energy exchange between normal modes. In the weakly nonlinear regime, those interactions may facilitate energy equipartition in Fourier space. We consider analytically resonant wave-wave interactions for the celebrated Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) system. Using a number-theoretical approach based on cyclotomic polynomials, we show that the problem of finding exact resonances for a system of N particles is equivalent to a Diophantine equation whose solutions depend sensitively on the set of divisors of N. We provide an algorithm to construct all possible resonances, based on two methods: pairing-off and cyclotomic, which we introduce to build up explicit solutions to the 4-, 5- and 6-wave resonant conditions. Our results shed some light in the understanding of the long-standing FPUT paradox, regarding the sensitivity of the resonant manifolds with respect to the number of particles N and the corresponding time scale of the interactions leading to thermalisation. In this light we demonstrate that 6-wave resonances always exist for any N, while 5-wave resonances exist if N is divisible by 3 and N > 6. It is known (for finite N) that 4-wave resonances do not mix energy across the spectrum, so we investigate whether 5-wave resonances can produce energy mixing across a significant region of the Fourier spectrum by analysing the interconnected network of Fourier modes that can interact nonlinearly via resonances. The answer depends on the set of odd divisors of N that are not divisible by 3: the size of this set determines the number of dynamically independent components, corresponding to independent constants of motion (energies). We show that 6-wave resonances connect all these independent components, providing in principle a restoring mechanism for full-scale thermalisation.",18,[],9

We find the emergence of SSB state with coexisting distinct dynamical states in the parametric space and show how the system transits from symmetry breaking state to out-of-phase synchronized (OPS) state while admitting multistabilities among the dynamical states. Further, we also investigate the effect of feedback factor on SSB as well as oscillation quenching states and we point out that the decreasing feedback factor completely suppresses SSB and oscillation death states. Interestingly, we also find the feedback factor completely diminishes only symmetry breaking oscillation and oscillation death (OD) states but it does not affect the nontrivial amplitude death (NAD) state.

Then we analyze the stability of the amplitude chimera states under various circumstances, including variations in system parameters and coupling strength, and perturbations in the initial states of the oscillators. For an increase in the value of the system parameter, namely the nonisochronicity parameter, the transient chimera state becomes a stable chimera state for a sufficiently large value of coupling strength. In addition, we also analyze the stability of these states by perturbing the initial states of the oscillators. We find that while a small perturbation allows one to perturb a large number of oscillators resulting in a stable amplitude chimera state, a large perturbation allows one to perturb a small number of oscillators to get a stable amplitude chimera state.

This prevents an unambiguous determination of the nucleon effective mass (equation) and its isovector splitting (equation). Complementary information from dipole polarizability of atomic nuclei helps in removing this ambiguity and plausible values of equation and equation can be arrived at.

Then, we study some basic nuclear properties such as the nuclear binding energy with several different choices of the chiral invariant mass.

We find that the inverse level density parameter K increases with increasing spin for all the systems, but it decreases with a deformation or a shape change that results in the enhancement of level density and emission probability.

1801.05933,nucl-th,"Recently, a new equation method for the calculation of asymptotic normalization coefficients (ANC) from phase-shift data has been formulated, proved and used for bound states. This method differs from the conventional one by fitting only the nuclear part of the effective-range function which includes a partial phase shift. It should be applied to large-charge nuclei when the conventional effective-range expansion or the Pad\'e-approximations using the effective-range function equation fitting do not work. A typical example is the nucleus vertex equationC equationO. Here we apply the equation method, which totally excludes the effective-range function, to isolated resonance states. In fact, we return to the initial renormalized scattering amplitude with a denominator which defines the well-known pole condition. Concrete calculations are made for the resonances observed in the equationHe-equationHe, equation-equation, and equation-equationC collisions. We use the experimental phase-shift and resonant energy data including their uncertainties and find the ANC variations for the states considered. The corresponding results are in a good agreement with those for the equation-matrix pole method which uses the differing formalism. The simple formula for narrow resonances given in the literature is used to check the deduced results. The related ANC function clearly depends on the resonance energy (equation) and width (equation), which is used to find the ANC uncertainty (equationANC) through the energy (equation) and the width (equation) uncertainties.We also discuss the equation method differences between bound and resonance states pole conditions.",18,[],11

For the calculation of the MI shell corrections equation, the Strutinsky smoothing procedure is used to obtain the average occupation numbers of the particle density using the solutions of the Woods-Saxon eigenvalue problem. We find that the major-shell structure of equation is generated by the same inhomogenuity of the distibution of single-particle states near the Fermi surface as the energy shell corrections equation.

1810.08402,nucl-th,"Predicting the properties of neutron-rich nuclei far from the valley of stability is one of the major challenges of modern nuclear theory. In heavy and superheavy nuclei, a difference of only a few neutrons is sufficient to change the dominant fission mode. A theoretical approach capable of predicting such rapid transitions for neutron-rich systems would be a valuable tool to better understand r-process nucleosynthesis or the decay of super-heavy elements. In this work, we investigate for the first time the transition from asymmetric to symmetric fission through the calculation of primary fission yields with the time-dependent generator coordinate method (TDGCM). We choose here the transition in neutron-rich Fermium isotopes, which was the first to be observed experimentally in the late seventies and is often used as a benchmark for theoretical studies. We compute the primary fission fragment mass and charge yields for 254 Fm, 256 Fm and 258 Fm from the TDGCM under the Gaussian overlap approximation. The static part of the calculation (generation of a potential energy surface) consists in a series of constrained Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations based on the D1S, D1M or D1N parameterizations of the Gogny effective interaction in a two-center harmonic oscillator basis. The 2-dimensional dynamics in the collective space spanned by the quadrupole and octupole moments is then computed with the finite element solver FELIX-2.0.

1811.07163,nucl-th,"Microscopic calculations of the electromagnetic response of medium-mass nuclei are now feasible thanks to the availability of realistic nuclear interactions with accurate saturation and spectroscopic properties, and the development of large-scale computing methods for many-body physics. The purpose is to compute isovector dipole electromagnetic (E1) response and related quantities, i.e. integrated dipole cross section and polarizability, and compare with data from photoabsorption and Coulomb excitation experiments. The single-particle propagator is obtained by solving the Dyson equation, where the self-energy includes correlations non-perturbatively through the Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction (ADC) method. The particle-hole (equation) polarization propagator is treated in the Dressed Random Phase Approximation (DRPA), based on an effective correlated propagator that includes some equation effects but keeps the same computation scaling as the standard Hartree-Fock propagator. The E1 responses for equationO, equationCa and equationNi have been computed: the presence of a soft dipole mode of excitation for neutron-rich nuclei is found, and there is a fair reproduction of the low-energy part of the experimental excitation spectrum. This is reflected in a good agreement with the empirical dipole polarizability values. For a realistic interaction with an accurate reproduction of masses and radii up to medium-mass nuclei, the Self-Consistent Green's Function method provides a good description of the E1 response, especially in the part of the excitation spectrum below the Giant Dipole Resonance.

It is found that the classical energy function exhibits two minima starting from a critical angular momentum value which depends on the single-particle configuration and the asymmetry measure equation. The emergence of the two minima is attributed to the breaking of the chiral symmetry. Quantizing the energy function for a given angular momentum, one obtains a Schrodinger equation with a coordinate dependent mass term for a symmetrical potential which changes from a single to a double well shape as the angular momentum pass the critical value.

By taking the ratio of angular distributions for two processes, viz. breakup and elastic scattering, this new observable is nearly independent of the reaction mechanism and hence much more sensitive to the projectile structure than the cross sections for each single process. We study the extension of the ratio method to proton-rich nuclei and also explore the optimum experimental conditions for measuring this new observable. We compare accurate dynamical calculations of reactions for proton-rich projectiles to the prediction of the ratio method. We use the dynamical eikonal approximation that provides good results for this kind of reactions at intermediate energy. Our tests for 8B, an archteypical one-proton halo nucleus, on Pb, Ni, and C targets at 44 MeV/nucleon show that, the ratio works less well than for neutron halos due to the non-negligible Coulomb interaction between the valence proton and the target. Nevertheless, the ratio method still provides pertinent information about nuclear structure on the proton-rich side of the valley of stability. Interestingly the method is not affected if energy ranges-or bins-are considered in the projectile continuum. This makes the ratio easier to measure experimentally by increasing the breakup cross section. We also extend our analysis to 17F, 25Al, and 27P, whose study is of interest to both nuclear astrophysics and nuclear structure.

1811.10784,nucl-th,"The Standard Model of particle physics, augmented with neutrino mixing, is at least very nearly the complete theory of interactions of known particles at energies accessible to Nature on Earth. Candidate effective theories of nuclear structure must therefore reflect SM symmetries, especially the chiral global equation symmetry of two-massless-quark QCD. For ground-state nuclei, SU(2) chiral perturbation theory (XPT) enables perturbation in inverse powers of equation, with analytic operators renormalized to all loop orders. We show that pion-less ""Static Chiral Nucleon Liquids"" (SXNL) emerge as a liquid phase of SU(2) XPT of protons, neutrons and 3 Nambu-Goldstone boson pions. Far-IR pions decouple from SXNL, simplifying the derivation of saturated nuclear matter and microscopic liquid drops (ground-state nuclides). We trace to the global symmetries of two-massless-quark QCD the power of pion-less SU(2) XPT to capture experimental ground-state properties of certain nuclides with even parity, spin zero, even proton number Z, and neutron number N.   We derive the SXNL effective SU(2) XPT Lagrangian, including all order equation operators. These include: all 4-nucleon operators that survive Fierz rearrangement in the non-relativistic limit, and effective Lorentz-vector iso-vector neutral ""equation-exchange"" operators. SXNL motivate nuclear matter as non-topological solitons at zero pressure: the Nuclear Liquid Drop Model and Bethe-Weizsacker Semi-Empirical Mass Formula emerge in an explicit Thomas-Fermi construction provided in the companion paper. For chosen nuclides, nuclear Density Functional and Skyrme models are justified to order equation.

The obtained uncertainties of the differential cross section and numerous scattering observables are in general small, grow with the reaction energy and amount up to a few percent at 200 MeV. We compare these uncertainties with the other types of theoretical errors like truncation errors, numerical uncertainties and uncertainties arising from using the various models of nuclear interaction. We find the latter ones to be dominant source of uncertainties of modern predictions for the three-nucleon scattering observables. To perform above mentioned studies we use the One-Pion-Exchange Gaussian potential derived by the Granada group, for which the covariance matrix of its parameters is known, and solve the Faddeev equation for the nucleon-deuteron elastic scattering.

When varying the cutoff, we require that the resulting interaction produces no spurious bound states in the deuteron channel.

We generalize the theory to a dynamic treatment; that is, continuous change of the NS structure (rearrangement of the stellar density distribution with the total baryon number fixed) as the decrease of temperature during the thermal evolution, is taken into account. It is found that the practical thermal energy used for the cooling is slightly lower than that is estimated in static situation, and hence the cooling of NSs is accelerated correspondingly but the effect is rather weak.

In particular, in this scheme the nuclear force is constructed such that the gross features of states in the nuclear chart are determined by a very simple leading-order interaction, whereas---much like the fine structure of atomic spectra---observables are moved to their physical values by small perturbative corrections.

1811.09396,physics,"We investigate the weakly nonlinear dynamics of transient gravity waves at infinite depth under the influence of a shear current varying linearly with depth. An analytical solution is permitted via integration of the Euler equations. Although similar problems were investigated in the 1960's and 70's for special cases of resonance, this is to our knowledge the first general wave interaction (mode coupling) solution derived to second order with a shear current present. Wave interactions are integrable in a spectral convolution to yield the second order dynamics of initial value problems.   To second order, irrotational wave dynamics interacts with the background vorticity field in a way that creates new vortex structures. A notable example is the large parallel vortices which drive Langmuir circulation as oblique plane waves interact with an ocean current. We also investigate the effect on wave pairs which are misaligned with the shear current. In contrast to a conjecture by Leibovich (1983) we find similar, but skewed, vortex structures in every case except when the mean wave direction is perpendicular to the direction of the current. Similar nonlinear wave-shear interactions are found to also generate near-field vortex structures in the Cauchy-Poisson problem with an initial surface elevation. These interactions create further groups of dispersive ring waves in addition to those present in linear theory.   The second order solution is derived in a general manner which accommodates any initial condition through mode coupling over a continuous wave spectrum.

We adopt two complementary approaches, both based on data extracted from numerical simulations: (i) We first characterise successive bifurcations through the analysis of leading frequencies. Two successive phases in the evolution of the system are singled out in this way, both leading to potentially chaotic states. The two phases are separated by a drastic simplification of the dynamics that immediately follows the emergence of intermittency. The second phase also features a second intermediate state where the dynamics is simplified due to frequency-locking. (ii) Nonlinear time series analysis enables us to reconstruct the attractor of the underlying dynamical system, and to calculate its correlation dimension and leading Lyapunov exponent. Both these quantities bring confirmation that the state preceding the dynamic simplification that initiates the second phase is chaotic.

Recently, a lattice-Boltzmann (LB) based multiscale simulation method has been developed to capture both NP scale and cellular level transport phenomenon at high computational efficiency. The basic components of this method include the LB treatment for the fluid phase, a spectrin-link method for RBCs, and a Langevin dynamics (LD) approach to capturing the motion of the suspended NPs. Comprehensive two-way coupling schemes are established to capture accurate interactions between each component. The accuracy and robustness of the LB-LD coupling method are demonstrated through the relaxation of a single NP with initial momentum and self-diffusion of NPs. This approach is then applied to study the migration of NPs in a capillary vessel under physiological conditions. It is shown that Brownian motion is most significant for the NP distribution in capillary vessels. For 1~100 nm particles, the Brownian diffusion is the dominant radial diffusive mechanism compared to the RBC-enhanced diffusion. For ~500 nm particles, the Brownian diffusion and RBC-enhanced diffusion are comparable drivers for the particle radial diffusion process.",18,[],5
1810.04486,physics,"For increasingly rarefied flowfields, the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations lose accuracy partially due to the single temperature approximation. To overcome this barrier, a continuum multi-temperature model based on the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) equation coupled with the Landau-Teller-Jeans relaxation model has been proposed for two-dimensional hypersonic non-equilibrium multi-temperature flow computation. In recent study, a two-stage fourth-order gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) has been developed for equilibrium flows, which achieves a fourth-order accuracy in space and time as well as high efficiency and robustness. In this paper, targeting for accurate and efficient simulation of multi-temperature non-equilibrium flows, a high-order three-dimensional multi-temperature GKS is implemented under the two-stage fourth-order framework, with the fourth-order Simpson interpolation rule for the newly emerged source term. Simulations on decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence, low-density nozzle flow, rarefied hypersonic flow over a flat plate, and type IV shock-shock interaction are used to validate the multi-temperature model through the comparison with experimental measurements. The unified gas kinetic scheme (UGKS) results, and the Direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) solutions will be used as well in some cases for validation. Computational results not only confirm the high-order accuracy and quite robustness of this scheme, but also show the significant improvement on computational efficiency compared with UGKS and DSMC, especially in the near continuum flow regime.",18,[],5
1807.03417,physics,"We analyze the primitive variables of fluid flow and scalar fields through fast Fourier transform (FFT) in the near and far wake of an elliptic cylinder. Numerical simulation of flow and scalar fields behind an elliptic cylinder of axis ratio 0.4 at a Reynolds number of 130 is performed. The semi-major axis of the elliptic cylinder is kept perpendicular to the incoming flow, where the fluid flow is two-dimensional and the Prandtl number is 0.71. The scalar is injected into the flow field by means of heating the cylinder continuously. The simulation is run for a long time to show that the secondary vortex street is a time-dependent phenomenon. Three distinguishable flow and scalar regions are observed in the wake of the cylinder. This study reveals the presence of low-frequency structures besides the primary shedding structures in linear, transition and saturation regions of temporal wake development. We show that the spectral source of the primary frequency is the saturated state of the temporal wake development, while its physical source is the periodic arrangement of structures of primitive variables, which inhibits the transmutation of their wavelength. On the other hand, the secondary low frequency is embedded in the transitional developing stage of the wake and its physical source is the chaotic behaviour of the transition process, which aids in the transmutation of the wavelength of the structures. Our spectral analysis also reveals that the scalar is predominately carried by the streamwise velocity and the pressure throughout the wake.",18,[],5
1810.11484,physics,"Dynamics of a bubble impacting and sliding a tilted surface has been investigated through experimental and computational methods. \textcolorblueSpecifically, shear stress generated on the wall has been calculated and compared with bacterium adhesion force in order to evaluate a potential sanitization function. In experiments, the bubble-wall interaction has been characterized for several different wall angles. We numerically solved a force balance including buoyancy, hydrodynamic inertia \& drag, lift and thin film force to determine the bubble motion. Results showed that the shear stress increases with the wall inclination. The maximum shear stress goes up to more than 300 Pa as a single bubble impacts and scrubs a tilted wall. We found that such a high shear stress is attributed to a rapid change in thin film curvature (flipping bubble/water interface) during the bouncing stage. Later, during the sliding stage, a smaller shear stress up to around 45 Pa is generated for a longer period of time. We also showed that the shear stress generated during the bouncing and sliding stages is high enough to remove bacteria from a surface as a potential method for removing bacteria from tilted surfaces.",18,[],5

1808.01910,physics,"We present a discrete element method (DEM) model to simulate the mechanical behavior of sea ice in response to ocean waves. The interaction of ocean waves and sea ice can potentially lead to the fracture and fragmentation of sea ice depending on the wave amplitude and period. The fracture behavior of sea ice is explicitly modeled by a DEM method, where sea ice is modeled by densely packed spherical particles with finite size. These particles are bonded together at their contact points through mechanical bonds that can sustain both tensile and compressive forces and moments. Fracturing can be naturally represented by the sequential breaking of mechanical bonds. For a given amplitude and period of incident ocean wave, the model provides information for the spatial distribution and time evolution of stress and micro-fractures and the fragment size distribution. We demonstrate that the fraction of broken bonds, , increases with increasing wave amplitude. In contrast, the ice fragment size l decreases with increasing amplitude. This information is important for the understanding of breakup of individual ice floes and floe fragment size.",18,[],5
1803.11312,physics,"Modal coupling between frequency-degenerate resonances of an optical ring resonator is a commonly observed phenomenon that results in adverse mode splitting. Traditionally, this coupling is attributed to Rayleigh scattering of a propagating electromagnetic wave into its associated degenerate counter-propagating mode from small perturbations to the dielectric material of the resonator. We have chosen to reframe the problem of intracavity Rayleigh scattering by considering the optical ring resonator as an infinitely-long, one-dimensional photonic crystal (PhC) that possesses a lattice constant equal to the perimeter of the ring. Through application of Bloch-Floquet theory, we show that modal coupling between degenerate resonances of a ring can effectively be described as the formation of photonic frequency bands in the dispersion relation of the resonator. We additionally demonstrate that the Bragg planes of the PhC lattice coincide with the phase matching conditions for constructive interference in the ring. Finally, we show that the magnitude of frequency splitting of a particular resonance is proportional to its associated coefficient in the Fourier expansion of the ring's periodic dielectric function.",18,[],5

Using a relativistic fluid model and taking into account the hydrodynamic pressure of degenerate electrons in the zero temperature limit, the nonlinear momentum equation of electrons is solved by means of a perturbative method and the nonlinear current density of the relativistic degenerate electrons is obtained. Saving only the third-order nonlinearity of the laser beam amplitude, a nonlinear equation describing the interaction of laser beam with the quantum plasma is derived. It is shown that considering the nonlinearity of system through solving nonlinear equation of degenerate electron leads to the originally different wave equation in comparison with outcomes of the approach in which the permittivity of longitudinal waves of quantum plasma is problematically extended to the relativistic case. The evolution of laser beam spot size with Gaussian profile is considered and the effect of quantum terms on the self-focusing quality is studied.

Conversely, pairwise interactions are often not enough to characterize social contagion processes such as opinion formation or the adoption of novelties, where complex mechanisms of influence and reinforcement are at work. Here we introduce a higher-order model of social contagion in which a social system is represented by a simplicial complex and contagion can occur through interactions in groups of different sizes. Numerical simulations of the model on both empirical and synthetic simplicial complexes highlight the emergence of novel phenomena such as a discontinuous transition induced by higher-order interactions. We show analytically that the transition is discontinuous and that a bistable region appears where healthy and endemic states co-exist. Our results help explain why critical masses are required to initiate social changes and contribute to the understanding of higher-order interactions in complex systems.",18,[],5

1811.03714,physics,"An Equilibrium Phase (EP) spray model has been recently proposed for modeling high-pressure diesel fuel injection, which is based on jet theory and a phase equilibrium assumption. In this approach, the non-equilibrium processes of drop breakup, collision and surface vaporization are neglected, assuming that spray vaporization is a mixing-controlled equilibrium process. A liquid-jet model and a gas-jet model are also intro-duced to improve grid-independency. In the current study, the EP model is applied in simulations of multi-hole gasoline direct injection (GDI). The model is validated at ambient densities from 3 to 9 kg/m3 and ambient temperatures from 400 K to 900 K, for two different GDI injectors, i.e. the Engine Combustion Network (ECN) Spray G injector and a GM injector. Iso-octane is used as the surrogate in consistency with available experi-ments.

1803.05688,physics,"Recent studies within the diffusive-thermal (constant-density) approximation have shown that, for premixed flames freely propagating in narrow adiabatic channels, the instabilities induced by differential diffusion may result in non-symmetric solutions and/or oscillating and rotating propagation modes. This has been shown in the context of lean mixtures, for which a single species transport equation with a single Lewis number (corresponding to the ratio of thermal to molecular diffusivity of the deficient reactant) can be used to describe the flame propagation problem. In the present work we extend the analysis to mixtures of any equivalence ratio. To this end, we consider a two-reactant model, where the different diffusivities of the two reactants introduce two different Lewis numbers. Steady-state computations and linear stability analysis are carried out for mixtures with large disparity between the Lewis number of the fuel (LeF) and the oxidizer (LeO), such as hydrogen-oxygen systems. It is shown that both differential diffusion and preferential diffusion have influence on the stability of the symmetric flame shape. For sufficiently lean and rich mixtures, the flame behaves as dictated by the Lewis number of the deficient reactant, i.e., the flame destabilizes toward non-symmetric solutions for large mass flow rates when the mentioned Lewis number is less than one. In near-stoichiometric mixtures the stability of the symmetric flame depends on a weighted average value of LeF and LeO. In particular, the symmetric solution is stable for large mass flow rates because of the difficulties found by the less diffusive reactant to reach the reactive zone of the flame.",18,[],5

Interestingly, low frequency electromagnetic plasma waves (Alfv\'en waves and whistlers) remain carried by confined massless photons. These just experience the increase in the dielectric constant provided by the plasma in the low frequency range below the cyclotron frequency.",18,[],5
1811.12741,physics,"The chemical modification of electrodes with organic materials is a common approach to tune the electronic and electrostatic landscape between interlayers in optoelectronic devices, thus facilitating charge injection at the electrode/semiconductor interfaces and improving their performance. The use of photochromic molecules for the surface modification allows dynamic control of the electronic and electrostatic properties of the electrode and thereby enables additional functionalities in such devices. Here, we show that the electronic properties of a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode are reversibly and dynamically modified by depositing organic photochromic switches (diarylethenes) in the form of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). By combining a range of surface characterization and density functional theory calculations, we present a detailed picture of the SAM binding onto ITO, the packing density of molecules, their orientation, as well as the work function modification of the ITO surface due to the SAM deposition. Upon illumination with ultraviolet and green light, we observe a reversible shift of the frontier occupied levels by 0.7 eV, and concomitantly a reversible work function change of ca. 60 meV.

Further, by characterizing the role of relevant monomer molecular orbitals, we arrive at a design principle that allows us to predict the presence or absence of an additional absorption based on the bonding geometry of the dimer. We find this rule correctly explains the spectra of a wide range of acene derivatives and solves an unexplained structure-spectrum phenomenon first observed seventy years ago. These results pave the way for the design of highly absorbent chromophores with applications ranging from photovoltaics to liquid crystals.",18,[],5
1803.02345,physics,"Geometric confinements are frequently encountered in soft matter systems and in particular significantly alter the dynamics of swimming microorganisms in viscous media. Surface-related effects on the motility of microswimmers can lead to important consequences in a large number of biological systems, such as biofilm formation, bacterial adhesion and microbial activity. On the basis of low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics, we explore the state diagram of a three-sphere microswimmer under channel confinement in a slit geometry and fully characterize the swimming behavior and trajectories for neutral swimmers, puller- and pusher-type swimmers. While pushers always end up trapped at the channel walls, neutral swimmers and pullers may further perform a gliding motion and maintain a stable navigation along the channel. We find that the resulting dynamical system exhibits a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation in which swimming in the mid-plane becomes unstable beyond a transition channel height while two new stable limit cycles or fixed points that are symmetrically disposed with respect to the channel mid-height emerge. Additionally, we show that an accurate description of the averaged swimming velocity and rotation rate in a channel can be captured analytically using the method of hydrodynamic images, provided that the swimmer size is much smaller than the channel height.",18,[],5

Superscattering can be typically constructed only at a single frequency regime, and depends critically on the inescapable material losses. Under such realistic conditions, superscattering has not been predicted nor observed to exist simultaneously at multiple frequency regimes. Here we introduce multifrequency superscattering in a subwavelength hyperbolic structure, which can be made from artificial metamaterials or from naturally-existing materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride (BN), and show the advantage of such hyperbolic materials for reducing structural complexity. The underlying mechanism is revealed to be the multimode resonances at multiple frequency regimes as appear in BN due to the peculiar dispersion of phonon-polaritons. Importantly, the multifrequency superscattering has a high tolerance to material losses and some structural variations, bringing the concept of multifrequency superscattering closer to useful and realistic conditions.",18,[],5

Investigating their swimming strategies with regard to the local environment is important to obtain in-depth understanding of their behavior in the aquatic environment. In the present research, to examine an impact of the shape and gravity on a swimming strategy, plankton is considered as settling swimming particles of ellipsoidal shape. The Q-learning approach is adopted to obtain swimming strategies for smart particles with a goal of efficiently moving upwards in a two-dimensional steady flow. Strategies obtained from reinforcement learning are compared to those of naive gyrotactic particles that is modeled considering the behavior of realistic plankton. It is found that elongation of particles improves the performance of upward swimming by facilitating particles' resistance to the perturbation of vortex. In the case when the settling velocity is included, the strategy obtained by reinforcement learning has similar performance to that of the naive gyrotactic one, and they both align swimmers in upward direction. The similarity between the strategy obtained from machine learning and the biological gyrotactic strategy indicates the relationship between the aspherical shape and settling effect of realistic plankton and their gyrotactic feature.",18,[],5
1808.06836,physics,"We present an efficient scheme to implement a gray optical molasses for sub-Doppler cooling of equationLi atoms with minimum experimental overhead. To integrate the equation light for the gray molasses (GM) cooling into the same optical setup that is used for the equation light for a standard magneto-optical trap (MOT), we rapidly switch the injection seeding of a slave laser between the equation and equation light sources. Switching times as short as equation can be achieved, inferred from monitor optical beat signals. The resulting low-intensity molasses cools a sample of equation atoms to about equation. A maximum phase-space density of equation is observed. On the same setup, the performance of the GM is compared to that of narrow-line cooling in a UV MOT, following the procedure in Sebastian et al.

Loading an optical dipole trap from the gray molasses yields a quantum degenerate sample with equation atoms, while loading from the denser UV MOT yields equation atoms.

The time-dependent Schrodinger equation of Hequation is numerically solved in the multipolar gauge in which the electric quadrupole term and the magnetic dipole term are explicitly expressed. This allows us to separate the contributions of the two terms in the momentum transfer. For different configurations of the molecular and the laser orientation, the transferred momentum to the electron is evaluated at different internuclear distances with various photon energies  and two-center interferences are identified in the whole region. At small electron energies and small internuclear distances, we find significant deviations from the prediction of the classical double-slit model due to the strong mediation of the Coulomb potential.

The PIC operators on particles (projection, push, deposition) have been optimized to benefit from large SIMD vectors on both recent and older architectures. The efficiency of these vectorized operations increases with the number of particles per cell (PPC), typically speeding up three-dimensional simulations by a factor 2 with 256 PPC. Although this implementation shows acceleration from as few as 8 PPC, it can be slower than the scalar version in domains containing fewer PPC as usually observed in vectorization attempts.

1812.05423,physics,"Long periods of strong southward magnetic fields are known to be the primary cause of intense geomagnetic storms. The majority of such events are caused by the passage over Earth of a magnetic ejecta. Irrespective of the interplanetary cause, fast-forward shocks often precede such strong southward Bequation periods. Here, we first look at all long periods of strong southward magnetic fields as well as fast-forward shocks measured by the \textitWind spacecraft in a 22.4-year span. We find that 76\% of strong southward Bequation periods are preceded within 48 hours by at least a fast-forward shock but only about 23\% of all shocks are followed within 48 hours by strong southward Bequation periods. Then, we devise a threshold-based probabilistic forecasting method based on the shock properties and the pre-shock near-Earth solar wind plasma and interplanetary magnetic field characteristics adopting a `superposed epoch analysis'-like approach. Our analysis shows that the solar wind conditions in the 30 minutes interval around the arrival of fast-forward shocks have a significant contribution to the prediction of long-duration southward Bequation periods. This probabilistic model may provide on average a 14-hour warning time for an intense and long-duration southward Bequation period. Evaluating the forecast capability of the model through a statistical and skill score-based approach reveals that it outperforms a coin-flipping forecast.

The characteristics of the dust dynamics are investigated as a function of the differential gas flow rate, the background neutral pressure, the dust particle size as well as the neutral species of the gas. The experiments have been carried out in the table top Dusty Plasma Experimental (DPEx) device in which a plasma is created between a disk shaped anode and a grounded cathode in a equation-shaped pyrex glass tube. The asymptotic steady state flow velocity of the injected micron sized dust particles is found to increase with an increase of neutral flow velocity and decrease with an increase in the background pressure. Furthermore, this velocity is seen to be independent of the size of the dust particles but decreases with an increase in the mass of the background gas. A simple theoretical model, based on estimates of the various forces acting on the dust particles, is used to elucidate the role of neutrals in the flow dynamics of the dust particles. Our experiments thus provide a detailed microscopic understanding of some of the past phenomenological observations of dust flows in the DPEx device and can prove useful in future experimental implementations of dust flow experiments.",18,[],5

Semiconductor nanowire lasers have emerged as strong candidates for integrated systems with applications ranging from ultrasensitive sensing, to data communication technologies. Despite significant advances in their fundamental aspects, the integration within scalable photonic circuitry remains challenging. Here we report on the realization of hybrid photonic devices consisting of nanowire lasers integrated with wafer-scale lithographically designed V-groove plasmonic waveguides. We present experimental evidence of the lasing emission and coupling into the propagating modes of the V-grooves, enabling on-chip routing of coherent and sub-diffraction confined light with room temperature operation. Theoretical considerations suggest that the observed lasing is enabled by a waveguide hybrid photonic-plasmonic mode. This work represents a major advance towards the realization of application-oriented photonic circuits with integrated nanolaser sources.",18,[],5
1805.04411,physics,"Scatter can account for large errors in cone-beam CT (CBCT) due to its wide field of view, and its complicated nature makes its compensation difficult. Iterative polyenergetic reconstruction algorithms offer the potential to provide quantitative imaging in CT, but they are usually incompatible with scatter contaminated measurements. In this work, we introduce a polyenergetic convolutional scatter model that is directly fused into the reconstruction process, and exploits information readily available at each iteration for a fraction of additional computational cost. We evaluate this method with numerical and real CBCT measurements, and show significantly enhanced electron density estimation and artifact mitigation over pre-calculated fast adaptive scatter kernel superposition (fASKS). We demonstrate our approach has two levels of benefit: reducing the bias introduced by estimating scatter prior to reconstruction; and adapting to the spectral and spatial properties of the specimen.",18,[],5

We investigate their use for universal quantum machine learning models of response properties in molecules. After introducing a theoretical basis, we present and discuss numerical evidence based on measuring the potential energy's response with respect to atomic displacement and to electric fields. Prediction errors for corresponding properties, atomic forces and dipole moments, improve in a systematic fashion with training set size and reach high accuracy for small training sets. Prediction of normal modes and IR-spectra of some small molecules demonstrates the usefulness of this approach for chemistry.",18,[],5
1802.06242,physics,"A semiclassical impact parameter version of the continuum distorted wave-Eikonal initial state theory is developed to study the differential ionization of equation atoms in collisions with equation ions. Both post and prior forms of the transition amplitude are considered. The fully differential cross sections are calculated for the lithium targets in their ground and their first excited states and for the projectile ions at 16~MeV impact energy. The role of the internuclear interaction as well as the significance of the post-prior discrepancy in the ejected electron spectra are investigated. The obtained results for ejection of the electron into the azimuthal plane are compared with the recent measurements and with their corresponding values obtained using a fully quantum mechanical version of the theory. In most of the cases, the consistency of the present approach with the experimental and the quantum theoretical data is reasonable. However, for equation-state ionization, in the cases where no experimental data exist, there is a considerable difference between the two theoretical approaches. This difference is questionable and further experiments are needed to judge which theory makes a more accurate description of the collision dynamics.",18,[],5
1806.00396,physics,"We present a dynamic decomposition analysis of the wake flow in fluid-structure interaction (FSI) systems under both laminar and turbulent flow conditions. Of particular interest is to provide the significance of low-dimensional wake flow features and their interaction dynamics to sustain the free vibration of a square cylinder at a relatively low mass ratio. To obtain the high-dimensional data, we employ a body-conforming variational fluid-structure interaction solver based on the recently developed partitioned iterative scheme and the dynamic subgrid-scale turbulence model for a moderate Reynolds number. The snapshot data from high-dimensional FSI simulations are projected to a low-dimensional subspace using the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). We utilize each corresponding POD mode for detecting features: the vortex street, the shear layer and the near-wake bubble. We find that the vortex shedding modes contribute solely to the lift force, while the near-wake and shear layer modes play a dominating role to the drag force. We further examine the fundamental mechanism of this dynamical behavior and propose a force decomposition technique via low-dimensional approximation. We ascertain quantitatively that the shear layer feeds the vorticity flux to the wake vortices and the near-wake bubble during the wake-body synchronization. Based on the decomposition of wake dynamics, we suggest an interaction cycle for the frequency lock-in during the wake-body interaction, which provides the inter-relationship between the high amplitude motion and the dominating wake features. Through our investigation of wake-body synchronization below critical Re range, we discover that the bluff body can undergo a synchronized high-amplitude vibration due to flexibility-induced unsteadiness. The interaction cycle for the wake-synchronization is found to be valid for the turbulent wake flow.",18,[],5
1806.06661,physics,"The increased attention to energy savings has contributed to more widespread use of energy recovery systems for building ventilation. We investigate the efficiency of such systems under different outdoor conditions using exergy analysis and nonequilibrium thermodynamics. This analysis makes it possible to assess performance in terms of loss of work potential, to account for the different quality of energy and to localize and compare the different sources of loss in the system. It also enables the use of exergy efficiency as a single performance parameter, in contrast to the several indicators that are commonly used. These more common indicators are difficult to compare and relate to each other. Further, since there is no obvious optimal trade-off between them, it is challenging to combine them and develop a global performance indicator that allows for a sensible comparison of different technical solutions and different types of recovery devices. We illustrate the concepts by applying the analysis to a heat recovery ventilator (HRV) and to a structurally similar membrane energy recovery ventilator (MERV) that can exchange both heat and moisture. We show how the exergy efficiency can be used to identify the range of operating conditions for which the recovery ventilator is not beneficial as the energy cost is greater than the energy recovery. This is not trivial using traditional performance parameters, yet it is a natural outcome of exergy analysis. In addition, we identify the mechanism by which work potential is lost, which can help the eventual optimization of both the recovery process and the auxiliary systems present in ventilation systems.",18,[],5
1809.09708,physics,"Ferroelectrets are piezoelectrically-active polymer foams that can convert externally applied loads into electric charge. Existing processing routes used to create pores of the desired geometry and degree of alignment appropriate for ferroelectrets are based on complex mechanical stretching and chemical dissolution steps. As a simple, cost effective and environmentally friendly approach, freeze casting is able to produce aligned pores with almost all types of the materials, including polymers. In this work, we present the first demonstration of freeze casting to create polymeric ferroelectrets. The pore morphology, phase analysis, relative permittivity and direct piezoelectric charge coefficient (d33) of porous poly(vinylidene fluoride (PVDF) ferroelectrets with porosity volume fractions ranging from 24% to 78% were analysed. The long-range alignment of pore channels produced during directional freezing was shown to be beneficial in forming a highly polarised structure after breakdown of air in the pore channels via corona poling.

Computer simulations of many traditional physics and astronomy activities provide new features, controls, or vantage points to enhance learning beyond a hands-on activity. Virtual reality provides the capabilities of computer simulations and embodied cognition experiences through a hands-on activity making it a natural step to improve learning. We recreated the traditional ball-and-stick moon phases activity in virtual reality and compared participant learning using this simulation with using traditional methods.

1812.03521,physics,"We present the theory of special relativity here through the lens of differential geometry. In particular, we explicitly avoid any reference to hypotheses of the form ""The laws of physics take the same form in all inertial reference frames"" and ""The speed of light is constant in all inertial reference frames"", or to any other electrodynamic phenomenon. For the author, the clearest understanding of relativity comes about when developing the theory out of just the primitive concept of time (which is also a concept inherent in any standard exposition) and the basic tenets of differential geometry. Perhaps surprisingly, once the theory is framed in this way, one can predict existence of a ""universal velocity"" which stays the same in all ""inertial reference frames"". This prediction can be made by performing much more basic time measurement physical experiments that we outline in these notes, rather than experiments of an electrodynamic nature. Thus, had these physical experiments been performed prior to Michelson-Morley type experiments (which, in principle, could have been done in any period with precise enough time keeping instruments), the Michelson-Morley experiments would simply give us an example of a physical entity, i.e., light, which enjoys this special ""universal"" status.",18,[],5
1801.07503,physics,"In this work we present the outlines of possible experiments for dielectric laser acceleration (DLA) of ultra-short relativistic electron bunches produced by the ARES linac, currently under construction at the SINBAD facility (DESY Hamburg). The experiments are to be performed as part of the Accelerator on a Chip International Program (ACHIP), funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. At SINBAD we plan to test the acceleration of already pre-accelerated relativistic electron bunches in laser-illuminated dielectric grating structures. We present outlines of both the acceleration of ultra-short single bunches, as well as the option to accelerate phase-synchronous sub-fs microbunch trains. Here the electron bunch is conditioned prior to the injection by interaction with an external laser field in an undulator. This generates a sinusoidal energy modulation that is transformed into periodic microbunches in a subsequent chicane. The phase synchronization is achieved by driving both the modulation process and the DLA with the same laser pulse. In addition to the conceptual layouts and plans of the experiments we present start-to-end simulation results for different ARES working points.",18,[],5

Working on the Dequation-line of atomic equationK, we demonstrate efficient slowing of an atomic beam from equation down to equation with a final flux of equation. We give experimental details and compare our results to other established radiative slowing schemes in atomic and molecular physics.

1804.10914,physics,"In this study, a new degradation path of sunscreen active ingredient, 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate (EHMC) and 4-methoxycinnamic acid (MCA) in the presence of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), was discussed. The reaction products were detected using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Since HOCl treatment leads to more polar products than EHMC, application of polar extracting agents, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate/n-hexane mixture, gave better results in terms of chlorinated breakdown products identification than n-hexane. Reaction of EHMC with HOCl lead to the formation of C=C bridge cleavage products such as 2-ethylhexyl chloroacetate, 1-chloro-4-methoxybenzene, 1,3-dichloro-2-methoxybenzene, and 3-chloro-4-methoxybenzaldehyde. High reactivity of C=C bond attached to benzene ring is also characteristic for MCA, since it can be converted in the presence of HOCl to 2,4-dichlorophenole, 2,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone, 1,3-dichloro-2-methoxybenzene, 1,2,4-trichloro-3-methoxybenzene, 2,4,6-trichlorophenole, and 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxyacetophenone. Surprisingly, in case of EHMC/HOCl/UV, much less breakdown products were formed compared to non-UV radiation treatment. In order to describe the nature of EHMC and MCA degradation, local reactivity analysis based on the density functional theory (DFT) was performed. Fukui function values showed that electrophilic attack of HOCl to the C=C bridge in EHMC and MCA is highly favorable (even more preferable than phenyl ring chlorination). This suggests that HOCl electrophilic addition is probably the initial step of EHMC degradation.",18,[],5

The diffusion of metal atoms influences the crystallisation temperature and optical properties of phase change materials. When Au, Ag, Al, W structures are directly deposited on Ge2Sb2Te5 inter-diffusion occurs. Indeed, Au forms AuTe2 layers at the interface. Diffusion barrier layers, such as Si3N4 or stable diffusionless plasmonic materials, such as TiN, can prevent the interfacial damage. This work shows that the interfacial diffusion must be considered when designing phase change material tuned photonic devices, and that TiN is the most suitable plasmonic material to interface directly with Ge2Sb2Te5.",18,[],5

1806.10190,physics,"A mechanical beam chopper consists of a rotating disc of regularly spaced wide slits which allow light to pass through them.

From the standpoint of impact mitigation, the decreasing stiffness chain combined with the strain-softening behavior of HECs results in an order-of-magnitude improvement in force attenuation compared to the increasing stiffness chain. We extend this finding to the graded 2D arrays and demonstrate a similar trend of wave transmission efficiency contrast between the increasing and decreasing stiffness lattices.

We perform FWM measurements for different pump powers, wavelength detuning, GO coating lengths, and number of GO layers. Our experimental results show good agreement with theory, achieving up to ~9.5-dB enhancement in the FWM conversion efficiency for a 1.5-cm-long waveguide integrated with 2 layers of GO. We show theoretically that for different waveguide geometries an enhancement in FWM efficiency of ~ 20 dB can be obtained in the doped silica waveguides, and more than 30 dB in silicon nanowires and slot waveguides.

1805.08088,physics,"A scaling relation for the high frequency regime of streamwise energy spectra (in frequency domain) in the near-wall region is proposed. This is based on the dimensional analysis approach of \citeperry1977 and \citeZamalloa2014 together with the hypothesis that the small-scale fluctuations in the near-wall region should only depend on the viscous scales, analogous to the Prandtl's law-of-the-wall for the mean flow. This allows us to examine the lower bound for the high frequency regime where law-of-the-wall in spectra would hold. Observations in high-Reynolds-number turbulent boundary layer data indicate that a conservative estimate for the start of this high frequency regime is equation = 0.005 (which corresponds to 200 viscous time-units) across a range of wall-normal positions and Reynolds numbers. This is sufficient to capture the energetic viscous-scaled motions such as the near-wall streaks, which has a time scale of approximately 100 viscous units. This scaling relation and the spectral collapse is consistent with the observations in internal flows at lower Reynolds numbers \citeZamalloa2014.",18,[],5
1808.04797,physics,"A fundamental theoretical framework is formulated for the investigation of rovibronic spectra resulting from the coupling of molecules to one mode of the radiation field in an optical cavity. The approach involves the computation of (1) cavity-field-dressed rovibronic states, which are hybrid light-matter eigenstates of the `molecule  cavity radiation field' system, and (2) the transition amplitudes between these field-dressed states with respect to a weak probe pulse. The predictions of the theory are shown for the homonuclear Naequation molecule. The field-dressed rovibronic spectrum demonstrates undoubtedly that the Born--Oppenheimer approximation breaks down in the presence of the cavity radiation field. A clear fingerprint of the strong nonadiabaticity is found, which can only emerge in the close vicinity of conical intersections. In this work, the conical intersection is induced by the quantized radiation field, and it is thus called a ""light-induced conical intersection"" (LICI).

1812.07731,q-bio,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex injury that is hard to predict and diagnose, with many studies focused on associating head kinematics to brain injury risk. Recently, there has been a push towards using computationally expensive finite element (FE) models of the brain to create tissue deformation metrics of brain injury. Here, we developed a 3 degree-of-freedom lumped-parameter brain model, built based on the measured natural frequencies of a FE brain model simulated with live human impact data, to be used to rapidly estimate peak brain strains experienced during head rotational accelerations. On our dataset, the simplified model correlates with peak principal FE strain by an R2 of 0.80. Further, coronal and axial model displacement correlated with fiber-oriented peak strain in the corpus callosum with an R2 of 0.77. Using the maximum displacement predicted by our brain model, we propose an injury criteria and compare it against a number of existing rotational and translational kinematic injury metrics on a dataset of head kinematics from 27 clinically diagnosed injuries and 887 non-injuries. We found that our proposed metric performed comparably to peak angular acceleration, linear acceleration, and angular velocity in classifying injury and non-injury events. Metrics which separated time traces into their directional components had improved deviance to those which combined components into a single time trace magnitude.

1805.04538,q-bio,"Many organisms repartition their proteome in a circadian fashion in response to the daily nutrient changes in their environment. A striking example is provided by cyanobacteria, which perform photosynthesis during the day to fix carbon. These organisms not only face the challenge of rewiring their proteome every 12 hours, but also the necessity of storing the fixed carbon in the form of glycogen to fuel processes during the night. In this manuscript, we extend the framework developed by Hwa and coworkers (Scott et al., Science 330, 1099 (2010)) for quantifying the relatinship between growth and proteome composition to circadian metabolism. We then apply this framework to investigate the circadian metabolism of the cyanobacterium Cyanothece, which not only fixes carbon during the day, but also nitrogen during the night, storing it in the polymer cyanophycin. Our analysis reveals that the need to store carbon and nitrogen tends to generate an extreme growth strategy, in which the cells predominantly grow during the day, as observed experimentally. This strategy maximizes the growth rate over 24 hours, and can be quantitatively understood by the bacterial growth laws. Our analysis also shows that the slow relaxation of the proteome, arising from the slow growth rate, puts a severe constraint on implementing this optimal strategy. Yet, the capacity to estimate the time of the day, enabled by the circadian clock, makes it possible to anticipate the daily changes in the environment and mount a response ahead of time. This significantly enhances the growth rate by counteracting the detrimental effects of the slow proteome relaxation.",18,[],10
1806.01778,q-bio,"How stable and general is behavior once maximum learning is reached? To answer this question and understand post-acquisition behavior and its related individual differences, we propose a psychological principle that naturally extends associative models of Pavlovian conditioning to a dynamical oscillatory model where subjects have a greater memory capacity than usually postulated, but with greater forecast uncertainty. This results in a greater resistance to learning in the first few sessions followed by an over-optimal response peak and a sequence of progressively damped response oscillations. We detected the first peak and trough of the new learning curve in our data, but their dispersion was too large to also check the presence of oscillations with smaller amplitude. We ran an unusually long experiment with 32 rats over 3960 trials, where we excluded habituation and other well-known phenomena as sources of variability in the subjects' performance. Using the data of this and another Pavlovian experiment by Harris et al.

We found evidence that the RW model is the best nonlinear regression to data only for a minority of the subjects, while its dynamical extension can explain the almost totality of data with strong to very strong evidence.

We first develop a theoretical framework for analytically calculating the probability of discovering states and uncover the drastic effects of varying the number and length of simulations. We then use kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on a variety of physically inspired landscapes to characterize state discovery and transition pathways. Consistently, we find that FAST simulations discover target states with the highest probability and traverse realistic pathways. Furthermore, we uncover the pathology that short parallel simulations sometimes predict an incorrect transition pathway by crossing large energy barriers that long simulations would typically circumnavigate, which we refer to as pathway tunneling. To protect against tunneling, we introduce FAST-string, which samples along the highest-flux transition paths to refine an MSMs transition probabilities and discriminate between competing pathways. Additionally, we compare MSM estimators in describing thermodynamics and kinetics. For adaptive sampling, we recommend normalizing the transition counts out of each state after adding pseudo-counts to avoid creating sources or sinks. Lastly, we evaluate our insights from simple landscapes with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the folding of the letter-repressor protein. We find that FAST-contacts predicts the same folding pathway as long simulations but with orders of magnitude less simulation time.",18,[],10
1806.02230,q-bio,"Color induction is the influence of the surrounding color (inducer) on the perceived color of a central region. There are two different types of color induction: color contrast (the color of the central region shifts away from that of the inducer) and color assimilation (the color shifts towards the color of the inducer). Several studies on these effects used uniform and striped surrounds, reporting color contrast and color assimilation, respectively. Other authors (Kaneko and Murakami, J Vision, 2012) studied color induction using flashed uniform surrounds, reporting that the contrast was higher for shorter flash duration. Extending their work, we present new psychophysical results using both flashed and static (i.e., non-flashed) equiluminant stimuli for both striped and uniform surround. Similarly to them, for uniform surround stimuli we observed color contrast, but we did not obtain the maximum contrast for the shortest (10 ms) flashed stimuli, but for 40 ms. We only observed this maximum contrast for red, green and lime inducers, while for a purple inducer we obtained an asymptotic profile along flash duration. For striped stimuli, we observed color assimilation only for the static (infinite flash duration) red-green surround inducers (red 1st inducer, green 2nd inducer). For the other inducers' configurations, we observed color contrast or no induction. Since other works showed that non-equiluminant striped static stimuli induce color assimilation, our results also suggest that luminance differences could be a key factor to induce it.",18,[],10
1805.06487,q-bio,"The evolution of structure in biology is driven by accretion and change. Accretion brings together disparate parts to form bigger wholes. Change provides opportunities for growth and innovation. Here we review patterns and processes that are responsible for a 'double tale' of evolutionary accretion at various levels of complexity, from proteins and nucleic acids to high-rise building structures in cities. Parts are at first weakly linked and associate variously. As they diversify, they compete with each other and are selected for performance. The emerging interactions constrain their structure and associations. This causes parts to self-organize into modules with tight linkage. In a second phase, variants of the modules evolve and become new parts for a new generative cycle of higher-level organization. Evolutionary genomics and network biology support the 'double tale' of structural module creation and validate an evolutionary principle of maximum abundance that drives the gain and loss of modules.",18,[],10
1805.01277,q-bio,"Zebrafish pretectal neurons exhibit specificities for large-field optic flow patterns associated with rotatory or translatory body motion. We investigate the hypothesis that these specificities reflect the input statistics of natural optic flow. Realistic motion sequences were generated using computer graphics simulating self-motion in an underwater scene. Local retinal motion was estimated with a motion detector and encoded in four populations of directionally tuned retinal ganglion cells, represented as two signed input variables. This activity was then used as input into one of two learning networks: a sparse coding network (competitive learning) and backpropagation network (supervised learning). Both simulations develop specificities for optic flow which are comparable to those found in a neurophysiological study (Kubo et al. 2014), and relative frequencies of the various neuronal responses are best modeled by the sparse coding approach. We conclude that the optic flow neurons in the zebrafish pretectum do reflect the optic flow statistics. The predicted vectorial receptive fields show typical optic flow fields but also ""Gabor"" and dipole-shaped patterns that likely reflect difference fields needed for reconstruction by linear superposition.",18,[],10
1805.01260,q-bio,"Electrical brain stimulation is currently being investigated as a therapy for neurological disease. However, opportunities to optimize such therapies are challenged by the fact that the beneficial impact of focal stimulation on both neighboring and distant regions is not well understood. Here, we use network control theory to build a model of brain network function that makes predictions about how stimulation spreads through the brain's white matter network and influences large-scale dynamics. We test these predictions using combined electrocorticography (ECoG) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data who volunteered to participate in an extensive stimulation regimen. We posit a specific model-based manner in which white matter tracts constrain stimulation, defining its capacity to drive the brain to new states, including states associated with successful memory encoding. In a first validation of our model, we find that the true pattern of white matter tracts can be used to more accurately predict the state transitions induced by direct electrical stimulation than the artificial patterns of null models. We then use a targeted optimal control framework to solve for the optimal energy required to drive the brain to a given state. We show that, intuitively, our model predicts larger energy requirements when starting from states that are farther away from a target memory state. We then suggest testable hypotheses about which structural properties will lead to efficient stimulation for improving memory based on energy requirements. Our work demonstrates that individual white matter architecture plays a vital role in guiding the dynamics of direct electrical stimulation, more generally offering empirical support for the utility of network control theoretic models of brain response to stimulation.",18,[],10

1811.01425,q-bio,"Beta-diversity has been repeatedly shown to decline with increasing elevation, but the causes of this pattern remain unclear, partly because they are confounded by coincident variation in alpha- and gamma-diversity. We used 8,795 forest vegetation-plot records from the Czech National Phytosociological Database to compare the observed patterns of beta diversity to null-model expectations (beta-deviation) controlling for the effects of alpha- and gamma-diversity. We tested whether \beta-diversity patterns along a 1,200 m elevation gradient exclusively depend on the effect of varying species pool size, or also on the variation of the magnitude of community assembly mechanisms determining the distribution of species across communities (e.g., environmental filtering, dispersal limitation). The null model we used is a novel extension of an existing null-model designed for presence/absence data and was specifically designed to disrupt the effect of community assembly mechanisms, while retaining some key features of observed communities such as average species richness and species abundance distribution. Analyses were replicated in ten subregions with comparable elevation ranges. Beta-diversity declined along the elevation gradient due to a decrease in gamma-diversity, which was steeper than the decrease in alpha-diversity. This pattern persisted after controlling for alpha- and gamma-diversity variation, and the results were robust when different resampling schemes and diversity metrics were used. We conclude that in temperate forests the pattern of decreasing beta-diversity with elevation does not exclusively depend on variation in species pool size, as has been hypothesized, but also on variation in community assembly mechanisms. The results were consistent across resampling schemes and diversity measures, thus supporting the use of vegetation plot databases for understanding...",18,[],10
1811.04355,q-bio,"Persistent homology has been applied to brain network analysis for finding the shape of brain networks across multiple thresholds. In the persistent homology, the shape of networks is often quantified by the sequence of equation-dimensional holes and Betti numbers.The Betti numbers are more widely used than holes themselves in topological brain network analysis. However, the holes show the local connectivity of networks, and they can be very informative features in analysis. In this study, we propose a new method of measuring network differences based on the dissimilarity measure of harmonic holes (HHs). The HHs, which represent the substructure of brain networks, are extracted by the Hodge Laplacian of brain networks. We also find the most contributed HHs to the network difference based on the HH dissimilarity. We applied our proposed method to clustering the networks of 4 groups, normal control (NC), stable and progressive mild cognitive impairment (sMCI and pMCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

1806.03881,q-bio,"In studies of the visual system as well as in computer vision, the focus is often on contrast edges. However, the primate visual system contains a large number of cells that are insensitive to spatial contrast and, instead, respond to uniform homogeneous illumination of their visual field. The purpose of this information remains unclear. Here, we propose a mechanism that detects feature homogeneity in visual areas, based on latency coding and spike time coincidence, in a purely feed-forward and therefore rapid manner. We demonstrate how homogeneity information can interact with information on contrast edges to potentially support rapid image segmentation. Furthermore, we analyze how neuronal crosstalk (noise) affects the mechanism's performance. We show that the detrimental effects of crosstalk can be partly mitigated through delayed feed-forward inhibition that shapes bi-phasic postsynaptic events. The delay of the feed-forward inhibition allows effectively controlling the size of the temporal integration window and, thereby, the coincidence threshold. The proposed model is based on single-spike latency codes in a purely feed-forward architecture that supports low-latency processing, making it an attractive scheme of computation in spiking neuronal networks where rapid responses and low spike counts are desired.",18,[],10

1803.04377,q-bio,"The sinoatrial-node (SAN) is a complex heterogeneous tissue that generates a stable rhythm in healthy hearts, yet a general mechanistic explanation for when and how this tissue remains stable is lacking. Although computational and theoretical analyses could elucidate these phenomena, such methods have rarely been used in realistic (large-dimensional) gap-junction coupled heterogeneous pacemaker tissue models. In this study, we adapt a recent model of pacemaker cells (Severi et al. 2012), incorporating biophysical representations of ion channel and intracellular calcium dynamics, to capture physiological features of a heterogeneous population of pacemaker cells, in particular ""center"" and ""peripheral"" cells with distinct intrinsic frequencies and action potential morphology. Large-scale simulations of the SAN tissue, represented by a heterogeneous tissue structure of pacemaker cells, exhibit a rich repertoire of behaviors, including complete synchrony, traveling waves of activity originating from periphery to center, and transient traveling waves originating from the center. We use phase reduction methods that do not require fully simulating the large-scale model to capture these observations. Moreover, the phase reduced models accurately predict key properties of the tissue electrical dynamics, including wave frequencies when synchronization occurs, and wave propagation direction in a variety of tissue models. With the reduced phase models, we analyze the relationship between cell distributions and coupling strengths and the resulting transient dynamics. Further, the reduced phase model predicts parameter regimes of irregular electrical dynamics. Thus, we demonstrate that phase reduced oscillator models applied to realistic pacemaker tissue is a useful tool for investigating the spatial-temporal dynamics of cardiac pacemaker activity.",18,[],10
1811.08498,q-bio,"The complexity and size of state-of-the-art cell models have significantly increased in part due to the requirement that these models possess complex cellular functions which are thought--but not necessarily proven--to be important. Modern cell models often involve hundreds of parameters; the values of these parameters come, more often than not, from animal experiments whose relationship to the human physiology is weak with very little information on the errors in these measurements. The concomitant uncertainties in parameter values result in uncertainties in the model outputs or Quantities of Interest (QoIs). Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) aims at apportioning to individual parameters (or sets of parameters) their relative contribution to output uncertainty thereby introducing a measure of influence or importance of said parameters. New GSA approaches are required to deal with increased model size and complexity; a three stage methodology consisting of screening (dimension reduction), surrogate modeling, and computing Sobol' indices, is presented. The methodology is used to analyze a physiologically validated numerical model of neurovascular coupling which possess 160 uncertain parameters. The sensitivity analysis investigates three quantities of interest (QoIs), the average value of equation in the extracellular space, the average volumetric flow rate through the perfusing vessel, and the minimum value of the actin/myosin complex in the smooth muscle cell.

1810.11918,q-bio,"Rapidly evolving pathogens like influenza viruses can persist by accumulating antigenic novelty fast enough to evade the adaptive immunity of the host population, yet without continuous accumulation of genetic diversity. This dynamical state is often compared to the Red Queen evolving as fast as it can just to maintain its foothold in the host population: Accumulation of antigenic novelty is balanced by the build-up of host immunity. Such Red Queen States (RQS) of continuous adaptation in large rapidly mutating populations are well understood in terms of Traveling Wave (TW) theories of population genetics. Here we shall make explicit the mapping of the established Multi-strain Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model onto the TW theory and demonstrate that a pathogen can persist in RQS if cross-immunity is long-ranged and its population size is large populations allowing for rapid adaptation. We then investigate the stability of this state focusing on the rate of extinction and the rate of ""speciation"" defined as antigenic divergence of viral strains beyond the range of cross-inhibition. RQS states are transient, but in a certain range of evolutionary parameters can exist for the time long compared to the typical time to the most recent common ancestor (equation). In this range the steady TW is unstable and the antigenic advance of the lead strains relative to the typical co-circulating viruses tends to oscillate. This results in large fluctuations in prevalence that facilitate extinction. We shall demonstrate that the rate of TW fission into antigenically uncoupled viral populations is related to fluctuations of equation and construct a ""phase diagram"" identifying different regimes of viral phylodynamics as a function of evolutionary parameters.",18,[],10
1811.00004,q-bio,"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas emitted during biological wastewater treatment. A pseudo-mechanistic model describing three biological pathways for nitric oxide (NO) and N2O production was calibrated for mixed culture biomass from an activated sludge process using laboratory-scale experiments. The model (NDHA) comprehensively describes N2O producing pathways by both autotrophic ammonium oxidizing bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria. Extant respirometric assays and anaerobic batch experiments were designed to calibrate endogenous and exogenous processes (heterotrophic denitrification and autotrophic ammonium/nitrite oxidation) together with the associated net N2O production. Ten parameters describing heterotrophic processes and seven for autotrophic processes were accurately estimated (variance/mean < 25%). The model predicted NO and N2O dynamics at varying dissolved oxygen, ammonium and nitrite levels and was validated against an independent set of experiments with the same biomass. Aerobic ammonium oxidation experiments at two oxygen levels used for model evaluation (2 and 0.5 mg/L) indicated that both the nitrifier denitrification (42, 64%) and heterotrophic denitrification (7, 17%) pathways increased and dominated N2O production at high nitrite and low oxygen concentrations; while the nitrifier nitrification pathway showed the largest contribution at high dissolved oxygen levels (51, 19%). The uncertainty of the biological parameter estimates was propagated to N2O model outputs via Monte Carlo simulations as 95% confidence intervals.

1803.05377,q-bio,"Unlike other organs, the thymus and gonads generate non-uniform cell populations, many members of which perish, and a few survive. While it is recognized that thymic cells are 'audited' to optimize an organism's immune repertoire, whether gametogenesis could be orchestrated similarly to favour high quality gametes is uncertain. Ideally, such quality would be affirmed at early stages before the commitment of extensive parental resources. A case is here made that, along the lines of a previously proposed lymphocyte quality control mechanism, gamete quality can be registered indirectly through detection of incompatibilities between proteins encoded by the grandparental DNA sequences within the parent from which haploid gametes are meiotically derived. This 'stress test' is achieved in the same way that thymic screening for potential immunological incompatibilities is achieved - by 'promiscuous' expression, under the influence of the AIRE protein, of the products of genes that are not normally specific for that organ. Consistent with this, the Aire gene is expressed in both thymus and gonads, and AIRE deficiency impedes function in both organs. While not excluding the subsequent emergence of hybrid incompatibilities due to the intermixing of genomic sequences from parents (rather than grandparents), many observations, such as the number of proteins that are aberrantly expressed during gametogenesis, can be explained on this basis. Indeed, promiscuous expression could have first evolved in gamete-forming cells where incompatible proteins would be manifest as aberrant protein aggregates that cause apoptosis. This mechanism would later have been co-opted by thymic epithelial cells which display peptides from aggregates to remove potentially autoreactive T cells.",18,[],10

In this paper, we first investigate a simplified setting for studying RAFs, which are nevertheless relevant to real biochemistry and allows for a more exact mathematical analysis based on graph-theoretic concepts. This, in turn, allows for the development of efficient (polynomial-time) algorithms for questions that are computationally NP-hard in the general RAF setting. We then show how this simplified setting for RAF systems leads naturally to a more general notion of RAFs that are `generative' (they can be built up from simpler RAFs) and for which efficient algorithms carry over to this more general setting. Finally, we show how classical RAF theory can be extended to deal with ensembles of catalysts as well as the assignment of rates to reactions according to which catalysts (or combinations of catalysts) are available.",18,[],10
1809.04877,q-bio,"We analyze the collective dynamics of hierarchically structured networks of densely connected spiking neurons. These networks of sub-networks may represent interactions between cell assemblies or different nuclei in the brain. The dynamical activity pattern that results from these interactions depends on the strength of synaptic coupling between them. Importantly, the overall dynamics of a brain region in the absence of external input, so called ongoing brain activity, has been attributed to the dynamics of such interactions. In our study, two different network scenarios are considered: a system with one inhibitory and two excitatory sub-networks, and a network representation with three inhibitory sub-networks. To study the effect of synaptic strength on the global dynamics of the network, two parameters for relative couplings between these sub-networks are considered. For each case, a co-dimension two bifurcation analysis is performed and the results have been compared to large-scale network simulations. Our analysis shows that Generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) equations, well-known in predator-prey studies, yield a meaningful population-level description for the collective behavior of spiking neuronal interaction, which have a hierarchical structure. In particular, we observed a striking equivalence between the bifurcation diagrams of spiking neuronal networks and their corresponding GLV equations. This study gives new insight on the behavior of neuronal assemblies, and can potentially suggest new mechanisms for altering the dynamical patterns of spiking networks based on changing the synaptic strength between some groups of neurons.",18,[],10

That is, species prefer to stay in a good condition and the population gives birth; otherwise, in the bad situation individuals want to run away because of the fatal conditions. In this study, we analyse the impact of the purposeful kinesis model on running waves. The running waves in the population with kinesis are studied using numerical experiments. Both monotonic and non monotonic (Allee effect) dependence of the reproduction coefficient on the population density are studied. The possible benefits of the purposeful kinesis are demonstrated: with the higher diffusion, while the population without kinesis ends up with extinction, the population with kinesis stays alive and has the running wave behavior.

1804.08463,q-bio,"Pathogen transmission and virulence are main evolutionary variables broadly assumed to be linked through trade-offs. In well-mixed populations, these trade-offs are often ascribed to physiological restrictions, while populations with spatial self-structuring might evolve emergent trade-offs. Here, we reexamine a model of the latter kind proposed by Ballegooijen and Boerlijst with the aim of characterising the mechanisms causing the emergence of the trade-off and its structural robustness. Using invadability criteria, we establish the conditions under which an evolutionary feedback between transmission and virulence mediated by pattern formation can poise the system to a critical boundary separating a disordered state (without emergent trade-off) from a self-structured phase (where the trade-off emerges), and analytically calculate the functional shape of the boundary in a certain approximation. Beyond evolutionary parameters, the success of an invasion depends on the size and spatial structure of the invading and invaded populations. Spatial self-structuring is often destroyed when hosts are mobile, changing the evolutionary dynamics to those of a well-mixed population.

1809.11000,q-bio,"Symmetry breaking, a central principle of physics, has been hailed as the driver of self-organization in biological systems in general and biogenesis of cellular organelles in particular, but the molecular mechanisms of symmetry breaking only begin to become understood. Centrioles, the structural cores of centrosomes and cilia, must duplicate every cell cycle to ensure their faithful inheritance through cellular divisions. Work in model organisms identified conserved proteins required for centriole duplication and found that altering their abundance affects centriole number. However, the biophysical principles that ensure that, under physiological conditions, only a single procentriole is produced on each mother centriole remain enigmatic. Here we propose a mechanistic biophysical model for the initiation of procentriole formation in mammalian cells. The model faithfully recapitulates the experimentally observed transition from PLK4 uniformly distributed around the mother centriole, the ""ring"", to a unique PLK4 focus, the ""spot"", that triggers the assembly of a new procentriole. This symmetry breaking requires a dual positive feedback based on autocatalytic activation of PLK4 and enhanced centriolar anchoring of PLK4-STIL complexes by phosphorylated STIL. We find that, contrary to previous proposals, in situ degradation of active PLK4 is insufficient to break symmetry. Instead, the model predicts that competition between transient PLK4 activity maxima for PLK4-STIL complexes explains both the instability of the PLK4 ring and formation of the unique PLK4 spot. In the model, strong competition at physiologically normal parameters robustly produces a single procentriole, while increasing overexpression of PLK4 and STIL weakens the competition and causes progressive addition of procentrioles in agreement with experimental observations.",18,[],10
1806.07469,q-bio,"Arterial tissue failures lead to a number of clinical conditions that develop rapidly and unpredictably in vivo. Structural components and their interfacial mechanical strength of arterial tissue play a critical role in the process of arterail delamination. Therefore, there is a pressing need to understand the micromechanical mechanisms of arterial delamination. The objective of this study was to investigate various failure mechanisms (e.g. failure of collagen fibers) responsible for arterial interfacial delamination. In-situ tensile tests of fibers were performed on a micro-tester in the scanning electron microscope. A 3D unit cell model containing an individual fiber bridging two arterial tissue layers was constructed. An exponential cohesive zone model (CZM) was used to assess the stiffening and softening mechanical behaviors of collagen fiber bundles between the two arterial layers. An anisotropic constitutive model was implemented for characterizing the mechanical properties of the amorphous matrix which includes the fibrous cap and the underlying plaque tissue and a nonlinear elastic model was adopted for characterizing the mechanical properties of the fibers. The CZM and elastic parameter values of fibers were identified through an inverse boundary value approach that matches the load-displacement curves from simulation predictions of tensile test of collagen fibers with experimental measurements. The identified parameter values were then used as input in the 3D unit cell model, through which micromechanical factors affecting the resultant traction-separation relation for the unit cell were investigated via a parametric analysis.

1811.11443,q-bio,"The variation of blood flow characteristics caused by the probe pressure during noninvasive studies is of particular interest within the context of fundamental and applied research. It has been shown previously that the weak local pressure induces vasodilation, whereas the increased pressure is able to stop the blood flow in the compressed area, as well as to significantly change optical signals.   The blood flow oscillations measured by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) characterize the functional state of the microvascular system and can be used for noninvasive diagnostics of its abnormality. This study was intended to identify the patterns of the relationship between the oscillating components of blood flow registered by the LDF method under different levels of pressure applied to an optical fiber probe.   For this purpose we have developed an original optical probe capable of regulating the applied pressure. The developed protocol included six sequential records of the blood perfusion at pressure within the 0 to 200 mmHg range with unloading at the last stage.   Using wavelet analyses, we traced the variation of energy of oscillations for these records in five frequency bands associated with different vascular tone regulation mechanisms. Six young volunteers of the same age (three males and three females) were included in this preliminary study and the protocol was repeated five times in each volunteer. Totally 30 LDF records were available for the analyses. As expected, the LDF signal increases at weak pressure (30 mmHg) and decreases at increased pressure. The statistically stable amplification of endothelial associated blood flow oscillations under the 90 mmHg pressure allowed us to put forward a hypothesis that the endothelial activity increases. The possible causes of this phenomenon are discussed.",18,[],10
1812.07689,q-bio,"The computational problem of inferring the full haplotype of a cell starting from read sequencing data is known as haplotype assembly, and consists in assigning all heterozygous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) to exactly one of the two chromosomes. Indeed, the knowledge of complete haplotypes is generally more informative than analyzing single SNPs and plays a fundamental role in many medical applications. To reconstruct the two haplotypes, we addressed the weighted Minimum Error Correction (wMEC) problem, which is a successful approach for haplotype assembly. This NP-hard problem consists in computing the two haplotypes that partition the sequencing reads into two disjoint sub-sets, with the least number of corrections to the SNP values. To this aim, we propose here GenHap, a novel computational method for haplotype assembly based on Genetic Algorithms, yielding optimal solutions by means of a global search process. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we run GenHap on two synthetic (yet realistic) datasets, based on the Roche/454 and PacBio RS II sequencing technologies. We compared the performance of GenHap against HapCol, an efficient state-of-the-art algorithm for haplotype phasing. Our results show that GenHap always obtains high accuracy solutions (in terms of haplotype error rate), and is up to 4x faster than HapCol in the case of Roche/454 instances and up to 20x faster when compared on the PacBio RS II dataset. Finally, we assessed the performance of GenHap on two different real datasets.

Both signals should contribute, so here we use passive training with rotated visual feedback of hand position to prevent updates of predicted sensory consequences, but still recalibrate proprioception. After this training we measure participants' hand location estimates based on both efference-based predictions and afferent proprioceptive signals with self-generated hand movements as well as based on proprioception only with robot-generated movements. The changes in hand localization are equally large after training with robot- and self-generated hand movements. Both motor and proprioceptive changes are only slightly smaller as those after training with self-generated movements, confirming that recalibrated proprioception contributes to motor learning.",18,[],10
1812.09362,q-bio,"Developing whole-brain emulation (WBE) technology would provide immense benefits across neuroscience, biomedicine, artificial intelligence, and robotics. At this time, constructing a simulated human brain lacks feasibility due to limited experimental data and limited computational resources. However, I suggest that progress towards this goal might be accelerated by working towards an intermediate objective, namely insect brain emulation (IBE). More specifically, this would entail creating biologically realistic simulations of entire insect nervous systems along with more approximate simulations of non-neuronal insect physiology to make ""virtual insects."" I argue that this could be realistically achievable within the next 20 years. I propose that developing emulations of insect brains will galvanize the global community of scientists, businesspeople, and policymakers towards pursuing the loftier goal of emulating the human brain. By demonstrating that WBE is possible via IBE, simulating mammalian brains and eventually the human brain may no longer be viewed as too radically ambitious to deserve substantial funding and resources. Furthermore, IBE will facilitate dramatic advances in cognitive neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and robotics through studies performed using virtual insects.",18,[],10
1811.05456,q-bio,"Currently, third-generation sequencing techniques, which allow to obtain much longer DNA reads compared to the next-generation sequencing technologies, are becoming more and more popular. There are many possibilities to combine data from next-generation and third-generation sequencing.   Herein, we present a new application called dnaasm-link for linking contigs, a result of \textitde novo assembly of second-generation sequencing data, with long DNA reads. Our tool includes an integrated module to fill gaps with a suitable fragment of appropriate long DNA read, which improves the consistency of the resulting DNA sequences. This feature is very important, in particular for complex DNA regions, as presented in the paper. Finally, our implementation outperforms other state-of-the-art tools in terms of speed and memory requirements, which may enable the usage of the presented application for organisms with a large genome, which is not possible in~existing applications.   The presented application has many advantages as (i) significant memory optimization and reduction of computation time (ii) filling the gaps through the appropriate fragment of a specified long DNA read (iii) reducing number of spanned and unspanned gaps in the existing genome drafts.

1804.05964,q-bio,"The interaction between wavelet-like sensors in Divisive Normalization is classically described through Gaussian kernels that decay with spatial distance, angular distance and frequency distance. However, simultaneous explanation of (a) distortion perception in natural image databases and (b) contrast perception of artificial stimuli requires very specific modifications in classical Divisive Normalization. First, the wavelet response has to be high-pass filtered before the Gaussian interaction is applied. Then, distinct weights per subband are also required after the Gaussian interaction. In summary, the classical Gaussian kernel has to be left- and right-multiplied by two extra diagonal matrices.   In this paper we provide a lower-level justification for this specific empirical modification required in the Gaussian kernel of Divisive Normalization. Here we assume that the psychophysical behavior described by Divisive Normalization comes from neural interactions following the Wilson-Cowan equations. In particular, we identify the Divisive Normalization response with the stationary regime of a Wilson-Cowan model. From this identification we derive an expression for the Divisive Normalization kernel in terms of the interaction kernel of the Wilson-Cowan equations. It turns out that the Wilson-Cowan kernel is left- and-right multiplied by diagonal matrices with high-pass structure. In conclusion, symmetric Gaussian inhibitory relations between wavelet-like sensors wired in the lower-level Wilson-Cowan model lead to the appropriate non-symmetric kernel that has to be empirically included in Divisive Normalization to explain a wider range of phenomena.",18,[],10
1804.04428,q-bio,"Motivation: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are usually modelled as networks. These networks have extensively been studied using graphlets, small induced subgraphs capturing the local wiring patterns around nodes in networks. They revealed that proteins involved in similar functions tend to be similarly wired. However, such simple models can only represent pairwise relationships and cannot fully capture the higher-order organization of protein interactions, including protein complexes. Results: To model the multi-sale organization of these complex biological systems, we utilize simplicial complexes from computational geometry. The question is how to mine these new representations of PPI networks to reveal additional biological information. To address this, we define simplets, a generalization of graphlets to simplicial complexes. By using simplets, we define a sensitive measure of similarity between simplicial complex network representations that allows for clustering them according to their data types better than clustering them by using other state-of-the-art measures, e.g., spectral distance, or facet distribution distance. We model human and baker's yeast PPI networks as simplicial complexes that capture PPIs and protein complexes as simplices. On these models, we show that our newly introduced simplet-based methods cluster proteins by function better than the clustering methods that use the standard PPI networks, uncovering the new underlying functional organization of the cell. We demonstrate the existence of the functional geometry in the PPI data and the superiority of our simplet-based methods to effectively mine for new biological information hidden in the complexity of the higher order organization of PPI networks.",18,[],10
1808.01503,q-bio,"Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are believed to establish their regular, spatially correlated firing patterns by path integration of the animal's motion. Mechanisms for path integration, e.g. in attractor network models, predict stochastic drift of grid responses, which is not observed experimentally. We demonstrate a biologically plausible mechanism of dynamic self-organization by which border cells, which fire at environmental boundaries, can correct such drift in grid cells. In our model, experience-dependent Hebbian plasticity during exploration allows border cells to learn connectivity to grid cells. Border cells in this learned network reset the phase of drifting grids. This error-correction mechanism is robust to environmental shape and complexity, including enclosures with interior barriers, and makes distinctive predictions for environmental deformation experiments. Our work demonstrates how diverse cell types in the entorhinal cortex could interact dynamically and adaptively to achieve robust path integration.",18,[],10
1805.10733,q-bio,"Biological systems process information under noisy environment. Sensory adaptation model of E. coli is suitable for investigation because of its simplicity. To understand the adaptation processing quantitatively, stochastic thermodynamic approach has been attempted. Information processing can be assumed as state transition of a system that consists of signal transduction molecules using thermodynamic approach, and efficiency can be measured as thermodynamic cost. Recently, using information geometry and stochastic thermodynamics, a relationship between speed of the transition and the thermodynamic cost has been investigated for a chemical reaction model. Here, we introduce this approach to sensory adaptation model of E. coli, and examined a relationship between adaptation speed and the thermodynamic cost, and efficiency of the adaptation speed. For increasing external noise level in stimulation, the efficiency decreased, but the efficiency was highly robust to external stimulation strength. Moreover, we demonstrated that there is the best noise to achieve the adaptation in the aspect of thermodynamic efficiency. Our quantification method provides a framework to understand the adaptation speed and the thermodynamic cost for various biological systems.",18,[],10
1802.04069,q-bio,"When searching a target in a natural scene, both the target's visual properties and similarity to the background influence whether (and how fast) humans are able to find it. However, thus far it has been unclear whether searchers adjust the dynamics of their eye movements (e.g., fixation durations, saccade amplitudes) to the target they search for. In our experiment participants searched natural scenes for six artificial targets with different spatial frequency throughout eight consecutive sessions. High-spatial frequency targets led to smaller saccade amplitudes and shorter fixation durations than low-spatial frequency targets if target identity was known before the trial. If a saccade was programmed in the same direction as the previous saccade (saccadic momentum), fixation durations and successive saccade amplitudes were not influenced by target type. Visual saliency and empirical density at the endpoints of saccadic momentum saccades were comparatively low, indicating that these saccades were less selective. Our results demonstrate that searchers adjust their eye movement dynamics to the search target in a sensible fashion, since low-spatial frequencies are visible farther into the periphery than high-spatial frequencies. Additionally, the saccade direction specificity of our effects suggests a separation of saccades into a default scanning mechanism and a selective, target-dependent mechanism.",18,[],10
1808.05643,q-bio,"Resolving the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has been one of the central goals of modern ecology. Early debates about the relationship were finally resolved with the advent of a statistical partitioning scheme that decomposed the biodiversity effect into a ""selection"" effect and a ""complementarity"" effect. We prove that both the biodiversity effect and its statistical decomposition into selection and complementarity are fundamentally flawed because these methods use a na\""ive null expectation based on neutrality, likely leading to an overestimate of the net biodiversity effect, and they fail to account for the nonlinear abundance-ecosystem functioning relationships observed in nature. Furthermore, under such nonlinearity no statistical scheme can be devised to partition the biodiversity effects. We also present an alternative metric providing a more reasonable estimate of biodiversity effect. Our results suggest that all studies conducted since the early 1990s likely overestimated the positive effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning.",18,[],10
1805.09101,q-bio,"Recent studies suggest that the emergence of cooperative behavior can be explained by generalized reciprocity, a behavioral mechanism based on the principle of ""help anyone if helped by someone"". In complex systems, the cooperative dynamics is largely determined by the network structure which dictates the interactions among neighboring individuals. These interactions often exhibit multidimensional features, either as relationships of different types or temporal dynamics, both of which may be modeled as a ""multiplex"" network. Against this background, here we advance the research on cooperation models inspired by generalized reciprocity by considering a multidimensional networked society. Our results reveal that a multiplex network structure may enhance the role of generalized reciprocity in promoting cooperation, whereby some of the network dimensions act as a latent support for the others. As a result, generalized reciprocity forces the cooperative contributions of the individuals to concentrate in the dimension which is most favorable for the existence of cooperation.",18,[],10

In our article, we proposed, inter alia, that ""the daily travels of mandrills could be seen as a way to escape contaminated habitats on a local scale"". In their article, Bicca-Marques and Calegaro-Marques [2016] proposed an alternative mechanism that they considered to be more parsimonious. In their view, increased DPL also increases exposure to novel parasites from the environment. In other words, while we proposed that elevated DPL may be a consequence of elevated parasite richness, they viewed it as a cause. We are happy to see that our study attracted so much interest that it evoked a public comment. We are also grateful to Bicca-Marques and Calegaro-Marques [2016] for pointing out an obvious alternative scenario that we failed to discuss and for laying out several key factors and assumptions that should be addressed by future studies examining the links between parasite risk and group ranging.

However, despite its growing popularity, each of the main steps in NF comes with its own set of often covert assumptions.

1808.00666,q-bio,"The consumption rate is a process critically important for the stability of consumer-resource systems and the persistence, sustainability and biodiversity of complex food webs. Its mathematical description in the form of functional response equations is a key problem for describing all trophic interactions. Because some of the functional response models used in this study presented redundancy between its parameters two methods were used to check for parameter redundancy: the Hessian matrix calculation using automatic differentiation (AD) which calculates derivatives numerically, but does not use finite differences, and the symbolic method that calculates a derivative matrix and its rank. In this work, we found that the models that better describe the functional response of a rotifer is consumer dependant even at low consumer densities, but their parameters can not be estimated simultaneously because parameter redundancy. This means that fewer parameters or parameter combination can be estimated than the original number of parameters in the models. Here, the model parameters that incorporate intraspecific competition by interference in the consumer-resource interaction are not identifiable, suggesting that this problem may be more widespread than is generally appreciated in the literature of food webs. Including knowledge on competitive interactions in current model predictions will be a necessity in the next years for ecology as ecological models are getting more complex and more real.

1804.04500,q-bio,The treatment of obesity and diabetes remains a challenge and the biological mechanisms of these diseases are still not fully understood. Diabetes and obesity are associated with increased risk of the development of cardiovascular complications and there is an urgent need to find novel therapeutic approaches for treating obesity and diabetes. Currently there are several approaches to treat these diseases. Among them chemical uncouplers could be used as an effective treatment for obesity but the dangerous side effects of these compounds has limited their use in vivo. Here we propose a novel theoretical model based on the mechanism of action of chemical uncouplers: the thermogenin-like system (TLS). The TLS may be used in vivo to reproduce the mechanism of action of chemical uncouplers but without their dangerous side effects.,18,[],10
1812.09137,q-bio,"With the rise of computers, simulation models have emerged beside the more traditional statistical and mathematical models as a third pillar for ecological analysis. Broadly speaking, a simulation model is an algorithm, typically implemented as a computer program, which propagates the states of a system forward. Unlike in a mathematical model, however, this propagation does not employ the methods of calculus but rather a set of rules or formulae that directly prescribe the next state. Such an algorithmic model specification is particularly suited for describing systems that are difficult to capture or analyze with differential equations such as: (a) systems that are highly nonlinear or chaotic; (b) discrete systems, for example networks or groups of distinct individuals; (c) systems that are stochastic; and (d) systems that are too complex to be successfully treated with classical calculus. As these situations are frequently encountered in ecology, simulation models are now widely applied across the discipline. They have been instrumental in developing new insights into classical questions of species' coexistence, community assembly, population dynamics, biogeography, and many more. The methods for this relatively young field are still being actively developed, and practical work with simulation models requires ecologists to learn new skills such as coding, sensitivity analysis, calibration, validation, and forecasting uncertainties.

The foundation of our data-driven computations for such dynamic patterns relies on one universal phenomenon discovered across 696 informative pixels. This universality is that each pixel's progressive 5-percentile process oscillates in an irregular fashion at first, but, after the middle point of inter-ictal period, the oscillation is replaced by a steady increasing trend.

Previous work in cBCIs focuses on static stimuli, stimulus- or response- locked analyses, and often within-subject and experiment model training. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, we test the utility of cBCI on a scenario that more closely resembles natural conditions, where subjects visually scanned a video for target items in a virtual environment. Second, we use an experiment-agnostic deep learning model to account for the real-world use case where no training set exists that exactly matches the end-users task and circumstances.

1806.11369,q-bio,"Protein activity is a significant characteristic for recombinant proteins which can be used as biocatalysts. High activity of proteins reduces the cost of biocatalysts. A model that can predict protein activity from amino acid sequence is highly desired, as it aids experimental improvement of proteins. However, only limited data for protein activity are currently available, which prevents the development of such models. Since protein activity and solubility are correlated for some proteins, the publicly available solubility dataset may be adopted to develop models that can predict protein solubility from sequence. The models could serve as a tool to indirectly predict protein activity from sequence. In literature, predicting protein solubility from sequence has been intensively explored, but the predicted solubility represented in binary values from all the developed models was not suitable for guiding experimental designs to improve protein solubility. Here we propose new machine learning models for improving protein solubility in vivo. We first implemented a novel approach that predicted protein solubility in continuous numerical values instead of binary ones. After combing it with various machine learning algorithms, we achieved a prediction accuracy of 76.28 percent when Support Vector Machine algorithm was used. Continuous values of solubility are more meaningful in protein engineering, as they enable researchers to choose proteins with higher predicted solubility for experimental validation, while binary values fail to distinguish proteins with the same value.

1807.03059,q-bio,"In the last decades, dispersal studies have benefited from the use of molecular markers for detecting patterns differing between categories of individuals and have highlighted sex-biased dispersal in several species. To explain this phenomenon, several hypotheses implying mating systems, intrasexual competition or sex-related handicaps have been proposed. In this context, we investigated sex-biased dispersal in Armadillidium vulgare, a terrestrial isopod with a promiscuous mating system. As a proxy for effective dispersal, we performed a fine-scale investigation of the spatial genetic structure in males and females, using individuals originating from five sampling points located within 70 meters of each other. Based on microsatellite markers and spatial autocorrelation analyses, our results revealed that while males did not present a significant genetic structure at this geographic scale, females were significantly and genetically more similar to each other when they were collected in the same sampling point. As females invest more parental care than males in A. vulgare, but also because this species is promiscuous and males experience a high intrasexual competition, our results meet the predictions of most classical hypotheses for sex-biased dispersal. We suggest that widening dispersal studies to other isopods or crustaceans, differing in their ecology or mating system and displaying varying levels of parental care, might shed light on the processes underlying the evolution of sex-biased dispersal.",18,[],10

We considered a spatial Hawk-Dove game played by animals in a patchy environment with wrap around boundaries. We posit that each site contains the same number of individuals. An evolution equation for analyzing the stability of the ESS is found as the mean dynamics of the classical frequency dependent Moran process coupled via migration and nonlocal payoff calculation in 1D and 2D habitats. The linear stability analysis of the model is performed and conditions to observe spatial patterns are investigated. For the nearest neighbor interactions (including von Neumann and Moore neighborhoods in 2D) we concluded that it is possible to destabilize the ESS of the game and observe pattern formation when the dispersal rate is small enough. We numerically investigate the spatial patterns arising from the replicator equations coupled via nearest neighbor payoff calculation and dispersal.,18,[],10
1804.11226,q-bio,"Monitoring the distribution of microfossils in stratigraphic successions is an essential tool for biostratigraphic, evolutionary and paleoecologic/paleoceanographic studies. To estimate the relative abundance (%) of a given species, it is necessary to estimate in advance the minimum number of specimens to be used in the count (n). This requires an a priori assumption about a specified level of confidence, and about the species population proportion (p). It is common use to apply the binomial distribution to determine n to detect the presence of more than one species in the same sample, although the multinomial distribution should necessarily be used instead.   The mathematical theory of sample size computation using the multinomial distribution is adapted to the computation of n for any number of species to be detected together (K) at any level of confidence. Easy-to-use extensive tables show n, for a combination of K and p. These tables indicate a large difference for n between that indicated by the binomial and those by the multinomial distribution when many species are to be detected simultaneously. Counting only 300 specimens (with 95 % confidence level) or 500 (99 %) is not enough to detect more than one taxon.   The reconstructed history of the micro-biosphere may therefore, in many instances, need to be largely revised. This revision should affect our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary relationships between the past changes in the biosphere and the other major reservoirs (hydrosphere, geosphere and atmosphere). In biostratigraphy and biochronology, using a much larger sample size, when more than one marker species is to be detected in the neighborhood of the same biozone boundary, may help clarifying the nature of the apparent inconsistencies given by the observed reversals in the ordinal (rank) biostratigraphic data shown as intersections of the correlation lines",18,[],10

In this work, we have investigated the consequences of long-term exposure of primary rat astrocytes to pristine graphene (GR) and graphene oxide (GO) flakes. We demonstrate that GR/GO interfere with a variety of intracellular processes as a result of their internalization through the endo-lysosomal pathway. Graphene-exposed astrocytes acquire a more differentiated morphological phenotype associated with extensive cytoskeletal rearrangements. Profound functional alterations are induced by GO internalization, including the upregulation of inward-rectifying K channels and of Na-dependent glutamate uptake, which are linked to the astrocyte capacity to control the extracellular homeostasis. Interestingly, GO-pretreated astrocytes promote the functional maturation of co-cultured primary neurons by inducing an increase in intrinsic excitability and in the density of GABAergic synapses. The results indicate that graphene nanomaterials profoundly affect astrocyte physiology in vitro, with consequences for neuronal network activity. This work supports the view that GO-based materials could be of great interest to address pathologies of the central nervous system associated to astrocyte dysfunctions.",18,[],10

1812.06182,q-bio,"Analytical expressions for the basic reproduction number, R0, have been obtained in the past for a wide variety of mathematical models for infectious disease spread, along with expressions for the expected final size of an outbreak. However, what has so far not been studied is the average number of infections that descend down the chains of infection begun by each of the individuals infected in an outbreak (we refer to this quantity as the ""average number of descendant infections"" per infectious individual, or ANDI). ANDI includes not only the number of people that an individual directly contacts and infects, but also the number of people that those go on to infect, and so on until that particular chain of infection dies out. Quantification of ANDI has relevance to the vaccination debate, since with ANDI one can calculate the probability that one or more people are hospitalised (or die) from a disease down an average chain of infection descending from an infected un-vaccinated individual. Here we obtain estimates of ANDI using both deterministic and stochastic modelling formalisms. With both formalisms we find that even for relatively small community sizes and under most scenarios for R0 and initial fraction vaccinated, ANDI can be surprisingly large when the effective reproduction number is >1, leading to high probabilities of adverse outcomes for one or more people down an average chain of infection in outbreaks of diseases like measles.",18,[],10
1807.00215,q-bio,"A network is scale-free if its connectivity density function is proportional to a power-law distribution. Scale-free networks may provide an explanation for the robustness observed in certain physical and biological phenomena, since the presence of a few highly connected hub nodes and a large number of small- degree nodes may provide alternate paths between any two nodes on average -- such robustness has been suggested in studies of metabolic networks, gene interaction networks and protein folding. A theoretical justification for why biological networks are often found to be scale-free may lie in the well-known fact that expanding networks in which new nodes are preferentially attached to highly connected nodes tend to be scale-free. In this paper, we provide the first efficient algorithm to compute the connectivity density function for the ensemble of all secondary structures of a user-specified length, and show both by computational and theoretical arguments that preferential attachment holds when expanding the network from length n to length n  1 structures. Since existent power-law fitting software, such as powerlaw, cannot be used to determine a power-law fit for our exponentially large RNA connectivity data, we also implement efficient code to compute the maximum likelihood estimate for the power-law scaling factor and associated Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-value.

Nevertheless, the power-law fit is visually a good approximation for the tail of connectivity data, and provides a rationale for investigation of preferential attachment in the context of macromolecular folding.",18,[],10
1805.07298,q-bio,"Among various possible causes of autoimmune disease, an important role is played by infections that can result in a breakdown of immune tolerance, primarily through the mechanism of ""molecular mimicry"". In this paper we propose and analyse a stochastic model of immune response to a viral infection and subsequent autoimmunity, with account for the populations of T cells with different activation thresholds, regulatory T cells, and cytokines. We show analytically and numerically how stochasticity can result in sustained oscillations around deterministically stable steady states, and we also investigate stochastic dynamics in the regime of bi-stability. These results provide a possible explanation for experimentally observed variations in the progression of autoimmune disease. Computations of the variance of stochastic fluctuations provide practically important insights into how the size of these fluctuations depends on various biological parameters, and this also gives a headway for comparison with experimental data on variation in the observed numbers of T cells and organ cells affected by infection.",18,[],10

1803.09107,q-bio,"Understanding the neural mechanism underlying subjective representation has become a central endeavor in cognitive-neuroscience. In theories of conscious perception, stimulus gaining conscious access is usually considered as a discrete neuronal event to be characterized in time or space, sometimes refer to as a 'conscious episode'. Surprisingly, the alternative hypothesis according to which conscious perception is a dynamic process has been rarely considered. Here, we discuss this hypothesis and envisage its implications. We show how it can reconcile inconsistent empirical findings on the timing of the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs), and make testable predictions. According to this hypothesis, a stimulus is consciously perceived for as long as it is recoded to fit an ongoing stream composed of all other perceived stimuli. We suggest that this 'updating' process is governed by at least three factors (1) context, (2) stimulus saliency and (3) observer's goal. Finally, this framework forces us to reconsider the typical distinction between conscious and unconscious information processing.",18,[],10
1804.06050,q-bio,"Background: Since the invention of next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies, they have become a powerful tool to study the presence and quantity of RNA molecules in biological samples and have revolutionized transcriptomic studies. The analysis of RNA-seq data at four different levels (samples, genes, transcripts, and exons) involve multiple statistical and computational questions, some of which remain challenging up to date.   Results: We review RNA-seq analysis tools at the sample, gene, transcript, and exon levels from a statistical perspective. We also highlight the biological and statistical questions of most practical considerations.   Conclusion: The development of statistical and computational methods for analyzing RNA- seq data has made significant advances in the past decade. However, methods developed to answer the same biological question often rely on diverse statical models and exhibit different performance under different scenarios.

1807.08952,q-bio,"Neural responses in the cortex change over time both systematically, due to ongoing plasticity and learning, and seemingly randomly, due to various sources of noise and variability. Most previous work considered each of these processes, learning and variability, in isolation -- here we study neural networks exhibiting both and show that their interaction leads to the emergence of powerful computational properties. We trained neural networks on classical unsupervised learning tasks, in which the objective was to represent their inputs in an efficient, easily decodable form, with an additional cost for neural reliability which we derived from basic biophysical considerations. This cost on reliability introduced a tradeoff between energetically cheap but inaccurate representations and energetically costly but accurate ones. Despite the learning tasks being non-probabilistic, the networks solved this tradeoff by developing a probabilistic representation: neural variability represented samples from statistically appropriate posterior distributions that would result from performing probabilistic inference over their inputs. We provide an analytical understanding of this result by revealing a connection between the cost of reliability, and the objective for a state-of-the-art Bayesian inference strategy: variational autoencoders. We show that the same cost leads to the emergence of increasingly accurate probabilistic representations as networks become more complex, from single-layer feed-forward, through multi-layer feed-forward, to recurrent architectures. Our results provide insights into why neural responses in sensory areas show signatures of sampling-based probabilistic representations, and may inform future deep learning algorithms and their implementation in stochastic low-precision computing systems.",18,[],10
1805.12311,q-bio,"Lattice-based stochastic simulators are commonly used to study biological reaction-diffusion processes. Some of these schemes that are based on the reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME), can simulate for extended spatial and temporal scales but cannot directly account for the microscopic effects in the cell such as volume exclusion and diffusion-influenced reactions. Nonetheless, schemes based on the high-resolution microscopic lattice method (MLM) can directly simulate these effects by representing each finite-sized molecule explicitly as a random walker on fine lattice voxels. The theory and consistency of MLM in simulating diffusion-influenced reactions have not been clarified in detail. Here, we examine MLM in solving diffusion-influenced reactions in 3D space by employing the Spatiocyte simulation scheme. Applying the random walk theory, we construct the general theoretical framework underlying the method and obtain analytical expressions for the total rebinding probability and the effective reaction rate. By matching Collins-Kimball and lattice-based rate constants, we obtained the exact expressions to determine the reaction acceptance probability and voxel size. We found that the size of voxel should be about 2% larger than the molecule. MLM is validated by numerical simulations, showing good agreement with the off-lattice particle-based method, eGFRD. MLM run time is more than an order of magnitude faster than eGFRD when diffusing macromolecules with typical concentrations in the cell. MLM also showed good agreements with eGFRD and mean-field models in case studies of two basic motifs of intracellular signaling, the protein production-degradation process and the dual phosphorylation cycle. Moreover, when a reaction compartment is populated with volume-excluding obstacles, MLM captures the non-classical reaction kinetics caused by anomalous diffusion of reacting molecules.",18,[],10

1805.09868,quant-ph,"We study the effect of local decoherence on arbitrary quantum states. Adapting techniques developed in quantum metrology, we show that the action of generic local noise processes -- though arbitrarily small -- always yields a state whose Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) with respect to local observables is linear in system size N, independent of the initial state. This implies that all macroscopic quantum states, which are characterized by a QFI that is quadratic in N, are fragile under decoherence, and cannot be maintained if the system is not perfectly isolated. We also provide analytical bounds on the effective system size, and show that the effective system size scales as the inverse of the noise parameter p for small p for all the noise channels considered, making it increasingly difficult to generate macroscopic or even mesoscopic quantum states. In turn, we also show that the preparation of a macroscopic quantum state, with respect to a conserved quantity, requires a device whose QFI is already at least as large as the one of the desired state. Given that the preparation device itself is classical and not a perfectly isolated macroscopic quantum state, the preparation device needs to be quadratically bigger than the macroscopic target state.",18,[],6

1801.09768,quant-ph,"The notion of contextuality, which emerges from a theorem established by Simon Kochen and Ernst Specker (1960-1967) and by John Bell (1964-1966), is certainly one of the most fundamental aspects of quantum weirdness. If it is a questioning on scholastic philosophy and a study of contrafactual logic that led Specker to his demonstration with Kochen, it was a criticism of von Neumann's ""proof"" that led John Bell to the result. A misinterpretation of this famous ""proof"" will lead them to diametrically opposite conclusions. Over the last decades, remarkable theoretical progresses have been made on the subject in the context of the study of quantum foundations and quantum information. Thus, the graphic generalizations of Cabello-Severini-Winter and Acin-Fritz-Leverrier-Sainz raise the question of the connection between non-locality and contextuality. It is also the case of the sheaf-theoretic approach of Samson Abramsky et al., which also invites us to compare contextuality with the logical structure of certain classical logical paradoxes. Another approach, initiated by Robert Spekkens, generalizes the concept to any type of experimental procedure. This new form of ""universal"" contextuality has been raised as a criterion of non-classicality, i.e. of weirdness. It notably led to identify the nature of curious quantum paradoxes involving post-selections and weak measurements.

1812.08766,quant-ph,"Symmetries of both closed and open-system dynamics imply many significant constraints. These generally have instantiations in both classical and quantum dynamics (Noether's theorem, for instance, applies to both sorts of dynamics). We here provide an example of such a constraint which has no counterpart for a classical system, that is, a uniquely quantum consequence of symmetric dynamics. Specifically, we demonstrate the impossibility of broadcasting asymmetry (symmetry-breaking) relative to a continuous symmetry group, for bounded-size quantum systems. The no-go theorem states that if two initially uncorrelated systems interact by symmetric dynamics and asymmetry is created at one subsystem, then the asymmetry of the other subsystem must be reduced. We also find a quantitative relation describing the tradeoff between the subsystems. These results cannot be understood in terms of additivity of asymmetry, because, as we show here, any faithful measure of asymmetry violates both sub-additivity and super-additivity. Rather, they must be understood as a consequence of an (intrinsically quantum) information-disturbance principle. Our result also implies that if a bounded-size quantum reference frame for the symmetry group, or equivalently, a bounded-size reservoir of coherence (e.g., a clock with coherence between energy eigenstates in quantum thermodynamics) is used to implement any operation that is not symmetric, then the quantum state of the frame/reservoir is necessarily disturbed in an irreversible fashion, i.e., degraded.",18,[],6
1804.11084,quant-ph,"Analog quantum simulations---simulations of one Hamiltonian by another---is one of the major goals in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum computation (NISQ) era, and has many applications in quantum complexity. We initiate the rigorous study of the physical resources required for such simulations, where we focus on the task of Hamiltonian sparsification. The goal is to find a simulating Hamiltonian equation whose underlying interaction graph has bounded degree (this is called degree-reduction) or much fewer edges than that of the original Hamiltonian equation (this is called dilution). We set this study in a relaxed framework for analog simulations that we call gap-simulation, where equation is only required to simulate the groundstate(s) and spectral gap of equation instead of its full spectrum, and we believe it is of independent interest.   Our main result is a proof that in stark contrast to the classical setting, general degree-reduction is impossible in the quantum world, even under our relaxed notion of gap-simulation. The impossibility proof relies on devising counterexample Hamiltonians and applying a strengthened variant of Hastings-Koma decay of correlations theorem. We also show a complementary result where degree-reduction is possible when the strength of interactions is allowed to grow polynomially. Furthermore, we prove the impossibility of the related sparsification task of generic Hamiltonian dilution, under a computational hardness assumption. We also clarify the (currently weak) implications of our results to the question of quantum PCP.

Notably, the originality of this work contributes to embedding the spherical capacitor in the optical cavity where the plasmon-plasmon interaction between capacitor plates manipulates the internal electric field. Therefore, using plasmon-plasmon interaction inside the spherical capacitor, which leads to nonlinearity, causes the contributed polarization function of the plasmonic property. Actually, this plasmonic property manages the spherical capacitance. Although the spherical capacitor is fundamentally dependent on the plasmonic properties caused by the capacitor gap, the spherical capacitor for a design is required to be parallel to the microwave capacitor. The system developed in the present work proved that the stability of the entanglement between optical cavity and microcavity modes toward the temperature changing is dramatically increased; which is the original goal of this study.

The new action-wave equation is the complete description of single dynamical histories, dissolving the classical-quantum divide.

1807.07325,quant-ph,Quantum dissipation is studied for a discrete system that linearly interacts with a reservoir of harmonic oscillators at thermal equilibrium. Initial correlations between system and reservoir are assumed to be absent. The dissipative dynamics as determined by the unitary evolution of system and reservoir is described by a Kraus map consisting of an infinite number of matrices. For all Laplace-transformed Kraus matrices exact solutions are constructed in terms of continued fractions that depend on the pair correlation functions of the reservoir. By performing factorizations in the Kraus map a perturbation theory is set up that conserves in arbitrary perturbative order both positivity and probability of the density matrix. The latter is determined by an integral equation for a bitemporal matrix and a finite hierarchy for Kraus matrices. In lowest perturbative order this hierarchy reduces to one equation for one Kraus matrix. Its solution is given by a continued fraction of a much simpler structure as compared to the non-perturbative case. In lowest perturbative order our non-Markovian evolution equations are applied to the damped Jaynes-Cummings model.

We show that under perfect measurement efficiency, entangled states can be reached with fidelity approaching unity under non-Markovian feedback control protocols, while Markovian protocols resulting from optimizing the feedback unitaries on ensemble averaged states still yield fidelities above 94%. Application of the PaQS approach to generation of N-qubit W, general Dicke and GHZ states shows that such entangled states can be efficiently generated with high fidelity, for up to N = 100 in some cases.",18,[],6

In addition to their interesting geometry, hypercube states display phase-space features much smaller than Planck's constant, and a large volume of Wigner-negativity. We theoretically show that these features make hypercube states sensitive to displacements at extremely small scales in a way that is surprisingly robust to initial thermal occupation and to small separation of the superposed state-components. In a high-temperature proof-of-principle optomechanics experiment we observe, and match to theory, the signature outer-edge vertex structure of hypercube states.",18,[],6
1808.03930,quant-ph,"Quantum processes of inherent dynamical nature, such as quantum walks (QWs), defy a description in terms of an equilibrium statistical physics ensemble. Up to now, it has remained a key challenge to identify general principles behind the underlying unitary quantum dynamics. Here, we show and experimentally observe that split-step QWs admit a characterization in terms of a dynamical topological order parameter (DTOP). This integer-quantized DTOP measures, at a given time, the winding of the geometric phase accumulated by the wave-function during the QW. We observe distinct dynamical regimes in our experimentally realized QWs each of which can be attributed to a qualitatively different temporal behavior of the DTOP. Upon identifying an equivalent many-body problem, we reveal an intriguing connection between the nonanalytic changes of the DTOP in QWs and the occurrence of dynamical quantum phase transitions.",18,[],6
1808.08112,quant-ph,"An evolution between a system and its environment which leads to pure dephasing of the system may either be a result of entanglement building up between the system and the environment or not (the second option is only possible for initially mixed environmental states). We find a way of distinguishing between an entangling and non-entangling evolutions for systems which are larger than a single qubit. The generalization of the single qubit separability criterion to larger systems is not sufficient to make this distinction (it constitutes a necessary condition of separability). A set of additional conditions for the operators describing the evolution of the environment depending on the state of the system is required. We find that the commutation of these environmental operators with the initial state of the environment does not guarantee separability, products of the operators need to commute among themselves for a pure dephasing evolution not to be accompanied by system-environment entanglement generation. This is a qualitative difference with respect to the single-qubit case, since it allows for a system to entangle with an initially completely mixed environment.",18,[],6

We argue on the similar spirit that quantum coherence is the fundamental resource when it comes to the creation of magic. This unifies the two strands of modern development in quantum technology under the common underpinning of existence of quantum superposition, quantified by the coherence in quantum theory.

The key idea of the method is a mapping of the ground state variational problem onto an Ising or quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem by expressing the expansion coefficients using spins or qubits. The algorithm is general and represents a new revolutionary approach for solving the real symmetric eigenvalue problem on a quantum annealer.

By using the quantum Fisher information (QFI), we investigate how the weak measurements performed before and after the accelerating observer, affect the optimal estimation of information encoded into the weight and phase parameters of the initial state shared between the parties. Studying the QFI, associated with weight parameter equation, we find that the acceleration at which the optimal estimation occurs may be controlled by weak measurements. Moreover, it is shown that the post-measurement plays the role of a quantum key for manifestation of the Unruh effect. On the other hand, investigating the phase estimation optimization and assuming that there is no control over the initial state, we show that the weak measurements may be utilized to match the optimal equation to its predetermined value. Moreover, in addition to determination of a lower bound on the QFI with the local quantum uncertainty, we unveil an important upper bound on the precision of phase estimation in our relativistic scenario, given by the maximal steered coherence (MSC).

More generally, we show that the optimal success probability depends on the reversible or irreversible character of the gates, the quantum or classical nature of the system and the system dimension. We analyse the bounds obtained in light of Landauer's principle, showing the entropic costs of the erasure associated with the game.

The completely mixed state is an attractive fixed point of the dynamics induced by the protocol. Our numerical simulations strongly indicate that initially mixed states all converge to the completely mixed state.

In these algorithms, a quantum computer evaluates the cost of a gate sequence (with speedup over classical cost evaluation), and a classical computer uses this information to adjust the parameters of the gate sequence. Here we present such an algorithm for quantum state diagonalization. State diagonalization has applications in condensed matter physics (e.g., entanglement spectroscopy) as well as in machine learning (e.g., principal component analysis). For a quantum state equation and gate sequence equation, our cost function quantifies how far equation is from being diagonal. We introduce novel short-depth quantum circuits to quantify our cost. Minimizing this cost returns a gate sequence that approximately diagonalizes equation. One can then read out approximations of the largest eigenvalues, and the associated eigenvectors, of equation. As a proof-of-principle, we implement our algorithm on Rigetti's quantum computer to diagonalize one-qubit states and on a simulator to find the entanglement spectrum of the Heisenberg model ground state.",18,[],6

We prove the bound to be tight for all systems in dimensions 2 and 3, which allows us to obtain computable expressions for the one-shot rate of distillation, establish an analytical expression for the best achievable fidelity of assisted distillation for any finite number of copies, and fully solve the problem of asymptotic zero-error assisted distillation for qubit and qutrit systems.

Here, we further explore the framework of AMM and provide improved device-independent bounds on the generalized robustness of entanglement, the incompatibility robustness and the incompatibility weight. We compare the tightness of our device-independent bounds against those obtained from other approaches. Along the way, we also provide an analytic form for the generalized robustness of entanglement for an arbitrary two-qudit isotropic state.

Second, we show that there always exists a sequence of priors for which the corresponding sequence of Bayes estimators is asymptotically minimax (i.e. it minimizes the worst-case risk). Third, by re-formulating Holevo's theorem for the covariant state estimation problem in terms of estimators, we find that any covariant measurement is, in fact, minimax (i.e. it minimizes the worst-case risk). Moreover, we find that a measurement is minimax if it is only covariant under a unitary 2-design.

To better understand the system's behaviour, we characterize the degree of asymmetry as a function of the coupling between the two optical cavities.

1810.00047,quant-ph,"We examine the performance of the single-mode GKP code and its concatenation with the toric code for a noise model of Gaussian shifts, or displacement errors. We show how one can optimize the tracking of errors in repeated noisy error correction for the GKP code. We do this by examining the maximum-likelihood problem for this setting and its mapping onto a 1D Euclidean path-integral modeling a particle in a random cosine potential. We demonstrate the efficiency of a minimum-energy decoding strategy as a proxy for the path integral evaluation. In the second part of this paper, we analyze and numerically assess the concatenation of the GKP code with the toric code. When toric code measurements and GKP error correction measurements are perfect, we find that by using GKP error information the toric code threshold improves from equation to equation. When only the GKP error correction measurements are perfect we observe a threshold at equation. In the more realistic setting when all error information is noisy, we show how to represent the maximum likelihood decoding problem for the toric-GKP code as a 3D compact QED model in the presence of a quenched random gauge field, an extension of the random-plaquette gauge model for the toric code. We present a new decoder for this problem which shows the existence of a noise threshold at shift-error standard deviation equation for toric code measurements, data errors and GKP ancilla errors. If the errors only come from having imperfect GKP states, this corresponds to states with just 4 photons or more. Our last result is a no-go result for linear oscillator codes, encoding oscillators into oscillators. For the Gaussian displacement error model, we prove that encoding corresponds to squeezing the shift errors.

In the first approach, the quantum device estimates inner products of quantum states to compute a classically intractable kernel. This kernel can be fed into any classical kernel method such as a support vector machine. In the second approach, we can use a variational quantum circuit as a linear model that classifies data explicitly in Hilbert space. We illustrate these ideas with a feature map based on squeezing in a continuous-variable system, and visualise the working principle with equation-dimensional mini-benchmark datasets.",18,[],6
1808.10773,quant-ph,"In this work, we develop a method to design control pulses for fixed-frequency superconducting qubits coupled via tunable couplers based on local control theory, an approach commonly employed to steer chemical reactions. Local control theory provides an algorithm for the monotonic population transfer from a selected initial state to a desired final state of a quantum system through the on-the-fly shaping of an external pulse. The method, which only requires a unique forward time-propagation of the system wavefunction, can serve as starting point for additional refinements that lead to new pulses with improved properties. Among others, we propose an algorithm for the design of pulses that can transfer population in a reversible manner between given initial and final states of coupled fixed-frequency superconducting qubits.",18,[],6
1809.02583,quant-ph,"The growing field of nano nuclear magnetic resonance (nano-NMR) seeks to estimate spectra or discriminate between spectra of minuscule amounts of complex molecules. While this field holds great promise, nano-NMR experiments suffer from detrimental inherent noise. This strong noise masks to the weak signal and results in a very low signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the noise model is usually complex and unknown, which renders the data processing of the measurement results very complicated. Hence, spectra discrimination is hard to achieve and in particular, it is difficult to reach the optimal discrimination. In this work we present strong indications that this difficulty can be overcome by deep learning (DL) algorithms. The DL algorithms can mitigate the adversarial effects of the noise efficiently by effectively learning the noise model. We show that in the case of frequency discrimination DL algorithms reach the optimal discrimination without having any pre-knowledge of the physical model. Moreover, the DL discrimination scheme outperform Bayesian methods when verified on noisy experimental data obtained by a single Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center. In the case of frequency resolution we show that this approach outperforms Bayesian methods even when the latter have full pre-knowledge of the noise model and the former has none. These DL algorithms also emerge as much more efficient in terms of computational resources and run times. Since in many real-world scenarios the noise is complex and difficult to model, we argue that DL is likely to become a dominant tool in the field.",18,[],6
1804.10678,quant-ph,"We demonstrate a compact source of four entangled telecommunication wavelength photons, which is used to generate a GHZ state, with minimal spectral and spatial entanglement. The spatial and spectral degree of freedom are minimized by careful source design. To optimize the entanglement between the two sources, distinguishing temporal information must be removed. We demonstrate this high degree of coherence, between pairs of sources, by performing a Hong-Ou-Mandel measurement. This measurement enables the optical path lengths within the system to be equalized, removing timing information from photons. We also measure the second order correlation function to test the rate of multi-pair production from a single pump pulse. With these optimizations completed, we measure a count rate of 13,600 counts/s per mW of pump power.",18,[],6
1807.10084,quant-ph,"We propose how to create and manipulate one-way nonclassical light via photon blockade in rotating nonlinear devices. We refer to this effect as nonreciprocal photon blockade (PB). Specifically, we show that in a spinning Kerr resonator, PB happens when the resonator is driven in one direction but not the other. This occurs because of the Fizeau drag, leading to a full split of the resonance frequencies of the countercirculating modes. Different types of purely quantum correlations, such as single- and two-photon blockades, can emerge in different directions in a well-controlled manner, and the transition from PB to photon-induced tunneling is revealed as well. Our work opens up a new route to achieve quantum nonreciprocal devices, which are crucial elements in chiral quantum technologies or topological photonics.",18,[],6

In our hybrid scheme, a classical information feed-forward is required from the quantum phase estimation algorithm to reduce a circuit depth from the original HHL algorithm. In this paper, we show that this hybrid algorithm is functionally identical to the HHL algorithm under the assumption that the number of qubits used in algorithms is large enough. In addition, it is experimentally examined with four qubits in the IBM Quantum Experience setups, and the experimental results of our algorithm show higher accurate performance on specific systems of linear equations than that of the HHL algorithm.",18,[],6
1801.04349,quant-ph,"We expand upon the standard quantum adiabatic theorem, examining the time-dependence of quantum evolution in the near-adiabatic limit. We examine a Hamiltonian that evolves along some fixed trajectory from equation to equation in a total evolution-time equation, and our goal is to determine how the final state of the system depends on equation. If the system is initialized in a non-degenerate ground state, the adiabatic theorem says that in the limit of large equation, the system will stay in the ground state. We examine the near-adiabatic limit where the system evolves slowly enough that most but not all of the final state is in the ground state, and we find that the probability of leaving the ground state oscillates in equation with a frequency determined by the integral of the spectral gap along the trajectory of the Hamiltonian, so long as the gap is big. If the gap becomes exceedingly small, the final probability is the sum of oscillatory behavior determined by the integrals of the gap before and after the small gap. We confirm these analytic predictions with numerical evidence from barrier tunneling problems in the context of quantum adiabatic optimization.",18,[],6

This approach is both straightforward and surprisingly efficient. We show that by simply randomizing how the summands are ordered, one can prove stronger bounds on the quality of approximation for product formulas of any given order, and thereby give more efficient simulations. Indeed, we show that these bounds can be asymptotically better than previous bounds that exploit commutation between the summands, despite using much less information about the structure of the Hamiltonian. Numerical evidence suggests that the randomized approach has better empirical performance as well.",18,[],6
1905.01190,astro-ph,"The peculiar short gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A has been firmly associated to the gravitational wave event GW170817, which has been unaninmously interpreted as due to the coalescence of a double neutron star binary. The unprecedented behaviour of the non-thermal afterglow led to a debate about its nature, which was eventually settled by high-resolution VLBI observations, which strongly support the off-axis structured jet scenario. Using information on the jet structure derived from multi-wavelength fitting of the afterglow emission and of the apparent VLBI image centroid motion, we compute the appearance of a GRB 170817A-like jet as seen by an on-axis observer and we compare it to the previously observed population of SGRB afterglows and prompt emission events. We find that the intrinsic properties of the GRB 170817A jet are representative of a typical event in the SGRB population, hinting at a quasi-universal jet structure. The diversity in the SGRB afterglow population could therefore be ascribed in large part to extrinsic (redshift, density of the surrounding medium, viewing angle) rather than intrinsic properties. Although more uncertain, the comparison can be extended to the prompt emission properties, leading to similar conclusions.",19,[],1
1903.11212,astro-ph,"During the last decade, numerous and varied observations, along with increasingly sophisticated numerical simulations, have awakened astronomers to the central role the circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays in regulating galaxy evolution. It contains the majority of the baryonic matter associated with a galaxy, along with most of the metals, and must continually replenish the star forming gas in galaxies that continue to sustain star formation. And while the CGM is complex, containing gas ranging over orders of magnitude in temperature and density, a simple emergent property may be governing its structure and role. Observations increasingly suggest that the ambient CGM pressure cannot exceed the limit at which cold clouds start to condense out and precipitate toward the center of the potential well. If feedback fueled by those clouds then heats the CGM and causes it to expand, the pressure will drop and the ""rain"" will diminish. Such a feedback loop tends to suspend the CGM at the threshold pressure for precipitation. The coming decade will offer many opportunities to test this potentially fundamental principle of galaxy evolution.",19,[],1
1907.10888,astro-ph,"Type II WLFs have weak Balmer line emission and no Balmer jump. We carried out a set of radiative hydrodynamic simulations to understand how the hydrogen radiative losses vary with the electron beam parameters and more specifically with the low energy cutoff. Our results have revealed that for low energy beams, the excess flare Lyman emission diminishes with increasing low energy cutoff as the energy deposited into the top chromosphere is low compared to the energy deposited into the deeper layers. Some Balmer excess emission is always present and is driven primarily by direct heating from the beam with a minor contribution from Lyman continuum backwarming. The absence of Lyman excess emission in electron beam models with high low energy cutoff is a prominent spectral signature of type II WLFs.",19,[],1
1908.01626,astro-ph,"Consistency checks of cosmological data sets are an important tool because they may suggest systematic errors or the type of modifications to \lcdm\ necessary to resolve current tensions. In this work, we derive an analytic method for calculating the level of correlations between model parameters from two correlated cosmological data sets, which complements more computationally expensive simulations. This method is an extension of the Fisher analysis that assumes a Gaussian likelihood and a known data covariance matrix. We apply this method to the SPTpol temperature and polarization CMB spectra (TE and EE). We find weak correlations between \lcdm\ parameters with a 9equation correlation between the TE-only and EE-only constraints on equation and a 25equation and 32equation correlation for log(equation) and equation respectively. Despite the negative correlations between the TE and EE power spectra, the correlations in the parameters are positive. The TE-EE parameter differences are consistent with zero, with a PTE of 0.53, in contrast to the PTE of 0.017 reported by SPTpol for the consistency of the TE and EE power spectra with \lcdm. Using simulations we find that the results of these two tests are independent and that this difference can arise simply from statistical fluctuations. Ignoring correlations in the TT-TE and TE-EE comparisons biases the equation low, artificially making parameters look more consistent. Therefore, we conclude that these correlations need to be accounted for when performing internal consistency checks of the TT vs TE vs EE power spectra for future CMB analyses.",19,[],1
1903.08593,astro-ph,"We investigate the physical properties of a sample of 52 Ly\alpha emitting galaxies in the VANDELS survey, with particular focus on the role of kinematics and neutral hydrogen column density in the escape and spatial distribution of Ly\alpha photons. For these galaxies, we derive different physical properties and characterize the Ly\alpha emission in terms of kinematics, EW, FWHM and spatial extension and then estimate the velocity of the neutral outflowing gas.   We reproduce some of the well known correlations between Ly\alpha EW and stellar mass, dust extinction and UV \beta slope, in the sense that the emission line appears brighter in lower mass, less dusty and bluer galaxies. We do not find any correlation with the SED-derived star formation rate, while we find that galaxies with brighter Ly\alpha tend to be more compact both in UV and in Ly\alpha. Our data reveal a new interesting correlation between the Ly\alpha velocity and the offset of the inter-stellar absorption lines with respect to the systemic redshift, in the sense that galaxies with larger inter-stellar medium (ISM) out-flow velocities show smaller Ly\alpha velocity shifts. We interpret this relation in the context of the shell-model scenario, where the velocity of the ISM and the HI column density contribute together in determining the Ly\alpha kinematics. In support to our interpretation, we observe that galaxies with high HI column densities have much more extended Ly\alpha spatial profiles, a sign of increased scattering. However, we do not find any evidence that the HI column density is related to any other physical properties of the galaxies, although this might be due in part to the limited range of parameters that our sample spans.",19,[],1
1908.05765,astro-ph,"The interpretation of upcoming weak gravitational lensing surveys depends critically on our understanding of the matter power spectrum on scales equation, where baryonic processes are important. We study the impact of galaxy formation processes on the matter power spectrum using a halo model that treats the stars and gas separately from the dark matter distribution. We use empirical constraints from X-ray observations (hot gas) and halo occupation distribution modelling (stars) for the baryons. Since X-ray observations cannot generally measure the hot gas content outside equation, we vary the gas density profiles beyond this radius. Compared with dark matter only models, we find a total power suppression of equation (equation) on scales equation (equation), where lower baryon fractions result in stronger suppression. We show that groups of galaxies (equation) dominate the total power at all scales equation. We find that a halo mass bias of equation (similar to what is expected from the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption) results in an underestimation of the power suppression of up to equation at equation, illustrating the importance of measuring accurate halo masses. Contrary to work based on hydrodynamical simulations, our conclusion that baryonic effects can no longer be neglected is not subject to uncertainties associated with our poor understanding of feedback processes. Observationally, probing the outskirts of groups and clusters will provide the tightest constraints on the power suppression for equation.",19,[],1
1905.11763,astro-ph,"Blueshifted absorption lines are seen in high inclination black hole binary systems in their disc dominated states, showing these power an equatorial disc wind. While some contribution from magnetic winds remain a possibility, thermal and thermal-radiative winds are expected to be present. We show results from radiation hydrodynamic simulations which show that the additional radiation force from atomic features (bound-free and lines) are important along with electron scattering. Together, these increase the wind velocity at high inclinations, so that they quantitatively match the observations in H 1743-322, unlike purely thermal winds which are too slow. We highlight the role played by shadowing of the outer disc from the (sub grid) inner disc Compton heated layer, and show that the increase in shadow from the higher Compton temperature after the spectral transition to the hard state leads to strong suppression of the wind. Thermal-radiative winds explain all of the spectral features (and their disappearance) in this simplest wind system and magnetic winds play only a minor role. We speculate that thermal-radiative winds can explain all the spectral features seen in the more complex (larger disc size) binaries, GRO J1655-40 and GRS 1915105, without requiring magnetic winds.",19,[],1

In this second installation of the series, we highlight the detection of neutral sodium on the ultra-hot giant WASP-76b.

We repeatedly detect the absorption signature of neutral sodium in the planet atmosphere (equation; equation in a equation \rA passband). The sodium lines have a Gaussian profile with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of equation km sequation. This is significantly broader than the line spread function of HARPS (equation km sequation).

1908.07686,astro-ph,"The 180-day Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping campaign on NGC 5548 discovered an anomalous period, the broad-line region (BLR) holiday, in which the emission lines decorrelated from the continuum variations. This is important since the correlation between the continuum-flux variations and the emission-line response is the basic assumption for black hole (BH) mass determinations through reverberation mapping. During the BLR holiday, the high-ionization intrinsic absorption lines also decorrelated from the continuum as a result of variable covering factor of the line of sight (LOS) obscurer. The emission lines are not confined to the LOS, so this does not explain the BLR holiday. If the LOS obscurer is a disk wind, its streamlines must extend down to the plane of the disk and the base of the wind would lie between the BH and the BLR, forming an equatorial obscurer. This obscurer can be transparent to ionizing radiation, or can be translucent, blocking only parts of the SED, depending on its density. An emission-line holiday is produced if the wind density increases only slightly above its transparent state. Both obscurers are parts of the same wind, so they can have associated behavior in a way that explains both holidays. A very dense wind would block nearly all ionizing radiation, producing a Seyfert 2 and possibly providing a contributor to the changing-look AGN phenomenon. Disk winds are very common and we propose that the equatorial obscurers are too, but mostly in a transparent state.",19,[],1
1903.06306,astro-ph,"We report on NuSTAR observations of transient pulsations in the neutron star X-ray binary SMC X-1. The transition from non-pulsing to pulsing states was not accompanied by a large change in flux. Instead, both pulsing and non-pulsing states were observed in a single observation during the low-flux super-orbital state. During the high-state, we measure a pulse period of equation at equation. Spectral analysis during non-pulsing and pulsing states reveals that the observations can be consistently modeled by an absorbed power law with a phenomenological cutoff resembling a Fermi-Dirac distribution, or by a partially obscured cutoff power law. The shapes of the underlying continua show little variability between epochs, while the covering fraction and column density vary between super-orbital states. The strength of pulsations also varies, leading us to infer that the absence and reemergence of pulsations are related to changing obscuration, such as by a warped accretion disk. SMC X-1 is accreting near or above its Eddington limit, reaching an unabsorbed X-ray luminosity of equation. This suggests that SMC X-1 may be a useful local analog to ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs), which likewise exhibit strong variability in their pulsed fractions, as well as flux variability on similar timescales. In particular, the gradual pulse turn-on which has been observed in M82 X-2 is similar to the behavior we observe in SMC X-1. Thus we propose that pulse fraction variability of ULXPs may also be due to variable obscuration.",19,[],1
1907.12318,astro-ph,"We present and discuss the properties of an ionized component with extreme kinematics in an off-nuclear HII region located at 0.8 - 1.0 kpc from the nucleus of SDSS J143245.98404300.3, recently reported in Rodriguez del Pino et al. (2019). The high-velocity gas component is identified by the detection of very broad emission wings in the Halpha line, with Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) > 850-1000 kms-1. Such gas kinematics are outstandingly high compared to other HII regions in local galaxies and similar to those reported in some star-forming clumps of galaxies at redshift around 2. The spatially resolved analysis indicates that the high velocity gas extends at least 90 pc and it could be compatible with an ionized outflow entraining gas at a rate 7 - 9 times larger than the rate at which gas is being converted into stars. We do not detect broad emission wings in other emission lines such as Hbeta, maybe due to moderate dust extinction, nor in [NII]6548, 6584 and [SII]6717, 6731, which could be caused by the presence of turbulent mixing layers originated by the impact of fast-flowing winds. The lack of spectral signatures associated to the presence of Wolf-Rayet stars points towards stellar winds from a large number of massive stars and/or supernovae as the likely mechanisms driving the high velocity gas.",19,[],1
1904.07237,astro-ph,"We present a joint strong lensing and stellar dynamical framework for future time-delay cosmography purposes. Based on a pixelated source reconstruction and the axisymmetric Jeans equations, we are capable of constraining cosmological distances and hence the current expansion rate of the Universe (equation) to the few percent level per lens, when high signal-to-noise integral field unit (IFU) observations from the next generation of telescopes become available. For illustrating the power of this method, we mock up IFU stellar kinematic data of the prominent lens system RXJ1131-1231, given the specifications of the James Webb Space Telescope. Our analysis shows that the time-delay distance (equation) can be constrained with 3.1% uncertainty at best, if future IFU stellar kinematics are included in the fit and if the set of candidate model parameterisations contains the true lens potential. These constraints would translate to a 3.2% precision measurement on equation in flat equationCDM cosmology from the single lens RXJ1131-1231, and can be expected to yield an equation measure with < 2.0% uncertainty, if similar gains in precision can be reached for two additional lens systems. Moreover, the angular diameter distance (equation) to RXJ1131-1231 can be constrained with 2.4% precision, providing two distance measurements from a single lens system, which is extremely powerful to further constrain the matter density (equation). The measurement accuracy of equation, however, is highly sensitive to any systematics in the measurement of the stellar kinematics. For both distance measurements, we strongly advise to probe a large set of physically motivated lens potentials in the future, to minimise the systematic errors associated with the lens mass parameterisation.",19,[],1

We compute the signal-to-noise ratio for the Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), the extended Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) surveys, showing that DESI will be able to detect the Doppler contribution in a Large Scale Structure (LSS) survey for the first time, with a S/N equation for equation Mpcequation, where requation denotes the minimum comoving separation between sources. We demonstrate that several physical parameters, introduced to provide a full modelling of the cross-correlation function, are affected by the Doppler contribution.

1908.01107,astro-ph,"Two bright X-ray transients were reported from the Chandra Deep Field South archival data, namely CDF-S XT1 and XT2. Whereas the nature of the former is not identified, the latter was suggested as an excellent candidate for a rapidly spinning magnetar born from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger. Here we propose a unified model to interpret both transients within the framework of the BNS merger magnetar model. According to our picture, CDF-S XT2 is observed from the ""free zone"" where the magnetar spindown powered X-ray emission escapes freely, whereas CDF-S XT1 originates from the ""trapped zone"" where the X-ray emission is initially blocked by the dynamical ejecta and becomes transparent after the ejecta is pushed to a distance where Thomson optical depth drops below unity. We fit the magnetar model to the light curves of both transients and derived consistent parameters for the two events, with magnetic field, initial spin period and X-ray emission efficiency being (equation, equation, equation) and (equation, equation, equation) for XT1 and XT2, respectively. The ""isotropic equivalent"" ejecta mass of XT1 is equation equation, while it is not constrained for XT2.

We derive two-dimensional stellar-mass distributions that are inferred from spatial mass-to-light ratio (M/L) corrections based on rest-frame optical colors. Due to the high central column densities of dust in our SMGs, our mass distributions likely represent a lower limit to the true central mass density. The centroid positions between the inferred stellar-mass and the dust distributions agree within 1.1 kpc, indicating an overall good spatial agreement between the two components. The majority of our sources exhibit compact dust configurations relative to the stellar component (with a median ratio of effective radii Re,dust/Re,Mstar = 0.6). This ratio does not change with specific star-formation rate (sSFR) over the factor of 30 spanned by our targets, sampling the locus of ""normal"" main sequence galaxies up to the starburst regime, log(sSFR/sSFRMS) > 0.5.

1904.05503,astro-ph,"We develop an improved Alcock-Paczynski (AP) test method that uses the redshift-space two-point correlation function (2pCF) of galaxies. Cosmological constraints can be obtained by examining the redshift dependence of the normalized 2pCF, which should not change apart from the expected small non-linear evolution. An incorrect choice of cosmology used to convert redshift to comoving distance will manifest itself as redshift-dependent 2pCF. Our method decomposes the redshift difference of the two-dimensional correlation function into the Legendre polynomials whose amplitudes are modeled by radial fitting functions. Our likelihood analysis with this 2-D fitting scheme tightens the constraints on equation and equation by equation compared to the method of Li et al. (2016, 2017, 2018) that uses one dimensional angular dependence only. We also find that the correction for the non-linear evolution in the 2pCF has a non-negligible cosmology dependence, which has been neglected in previous similar studies by Li et al.. With an accurate accounting for the non-linear systematics and use of full two-dimensional shape information of the 2pCF down to scales as small as equation it is expected that the AP test with redshift-space galaxy clustering anisotropy can be a powerful method to constrain the expansion history of the universe.",19,[],1
1908.00046,astro-ph,"In the standard cosmological model, dark matter drives the structure formation and constructs potential wells within which galaxies may form. The baryon fraction in dark halos can reach the universal value (15.7%) in massive clusters and decreases rapidly as the mass of the system decreases. The formation of dwarf galaxies is sensitive both to baryonic processes and the properties of dark matter owing to the shallow potential wells in which they form. In dwarf galaxies in the Local Group, dark matter dominates the mass content even within their optical-light half-radii (re ~ 1 kpc). However, recently it has been argued that not all dwarf galaxies are dominated by dark matter. Here we report 19 dwarf galaxies that could consist mainly of baryons up to radii well beyond re, at which point they are expected to be dominated by dark matter. Of these, 14 are isolated dwarf galaxies, free from the influence of nearby bright galaxies and high dense environments.

1906.07193,astro-ph,"Among the numerous discoveries resulting from the \it Kepler mission are a plethora of compact planetary systems that provide deep insights into planet formation theories. The architecture of such compact systems also produces unique opportunities to study orbital dynamics in compact environments and the subsequent evolution of orbital parameters. One of the compact \it Kepler systems is Kepler-89; a system for which the radial velocity follow-up observations place strong upper limits on the masses of the planets and their Keplerian orbital elements. The potential for non-circular orbits in this system make it a compelling system to study dynamical constraints on the measured orbital parameters. We present a dynamical analysis of the system that demonstrates the stability of the circular model and shows the eccentric model of the system is not stable. The analysis indicates that planets c and d, although close to the 2:1 secular resonance, do not permanently occupy the 2:1 resonance configuration. We explore regions of orbital parameter space to identify the upper bounds of orbital eccentricity for the planets.

1907.06039,astro-ph,"State-of-the-art one-dimensional (1D) stellar evolution codes rely on simplifying assumptions, such as mixing length theory, in order to describe superadiabatic convection. As a result, 1D stellar structure models do not correctly recover the surface layers of the Sun and other stars with convective envelopes. We present a method that overcomes this structural drawback by employing three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic simulations of stellar envelopes: at every time-step of the evolution interpolated 3D envelopes are appended to the 1D structure and are used to supply realistic boundary conditions for the stellar interior. In contrast to previous attempts, our method includes mean 3D turbulent pressure. We apply our method to model the present Sun. The structural shortcomings of standard stellar models lead to systematic errors in the stellar oscillation frequencies inferred from the model. We show that our method fully corrects for this error. Furthermore, we show that our realistic treatment of superadiabatic convection alters the predicted evolution of the Sun. Our results hence have important implications for the characterization of stars.

We investigated this scenario by characterizing the radio brightness distribution in the inner ~10-pc region of the source. We applied the very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) technique at four different frequencies from 1.7 to 7.6 GHz. We analyzed archival data from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) taken in 2014, and data from the European VLBI Network (EVN) obtained in 2017. The VLBI images reveal pc-scale extended structure in the core of 3C 411 that can be modeled with multiple jet components. The measured core brightness temperatures indicate no Doppler enhancement that would be expected from a blazar jet pointing close to the line of sight. While there is no blazar-type core in 3C 411, we found indication of flux density variability. The overall morphology of the source is consistent with a straight jet with ~50\deg inclination angle at all scales from pc to kpc.",19,[],1
1906.09827,astro-ph,"Positions and proper motions of Gaia sources are expressed in a reference frame that ideally should be non-rotating relative to distant extragalactic objects, coincident with the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS), and consistent across all magnitudes. For sources fainter than 16th magnitude this is achieved thanks to Gaia's direct observations of quasars. At brighter magnitudes it is difficult to validate the quality of the reference frame due to the scarcity of comparison data. This paper examines the use of VLBI observations of radio stars to determine the spin and orientation of the bright reference frame of Gaia. Simultaneous estimation of the six spin and orientation parameters makes optimal use of VLBI data and makes it possible to include even single-epoch VLBI observations in the solution. The method is applied to Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) using published VLBI data for 41 radio stars. Results for the 26 best-fitting sources indicate that the bright reference frame of Gaia DR2 is rotating relative to the faint quasars at a rate of about 0.1 mas/yr, significant at 2-sigma level. This supports a similar conclusion based on a comparison with stellar positions in the Hipparcos frame. The accuracy is currently limited by the small number of radio sources used, by uncertainties in the Gaia DR2 proper motions, and by the astrophysical nature of the radio stars. While the origin of the indicated rotation is understood and can be avoided in future data releases, it remains important to validate the bright reference frame of Gaia by independent observations. This can be achieved using VLBI astrometry, which may require re-observing the old sample of radio stars as well as measuring new objects. The unique historical value of positional measurements is stressed and VLBI observers are urged to ensure that relevant positional information is preserved for the future.",19,[],1
1907.00938,astro-ph,"We present time-resolved 10.4-m GTC and 4.2-m WHT intermediate resolution spectroscopy of the X-ray transient MAXI J1820070 (=ASASSN-18ey) obtained during its decline to the quiescent state. Cross-correlation of the 21 individual spectra against late-type templates reveals a sinusoidal velocity modulation with a period of 0.68549 /- 0.00001 d and semi-amplitude of 417.7 /- 3.9 km/s. We derive a mass function f(M) = 5.18 /- 0.15 Msun, dynamically confirming the black hole nature of the compact object. Our analysis of the stellar absorption features supports a K3-5 spectral classification for the donor star, which contributes 20% of the total flux at 5200-6800 Angs. The photometric 0.703 /- 0.003 d periodicity observed during outburst is 2.6% longer than the orbital period supporting the presence of a superhump modulation in the outburst lightcurves. In line with this interpretation, we constrain the binary mass ratio to be q=0.12. In addition, we observe a sharp increase in the Halpha emission line equivalent width during inferior conjunction of the donor star that we interpret as a grazing eclipse of the accretion disc and allows us to constrain the binary inclination to > 69 deg. On the other hand, the absence of X-ray eclipses during outburst imply i < 77 deg. These inclination limits, together with our dynamical solution, lead to a black hole mass in the range 7-8 Msun. We also measure a systemic velocity = -21.6 /- 2.3 km/s which, combined with the Gaia DR2 proper motion and parallax, implies a large peculiar velocity of 100 km/s.",19,[],1
1908.08749,astro-ph,"In isolated solar active regions, we find that the waiting times between flares correlate with flare magnitudes as determined by the GOES soft X-ray fluxes. A ""build-up and release"" scenario (BUR) for magnetic energy storage in the solar corona suggests the existence of such a relationship, relating the slowly varying subphotospheric energy sources to the sudden coronal energy releases of flares and CMEs. Substantial amounts of research effort had not previously found any obvious observational evidence for such a BUR process. This has posed a puzzle since coronal magnetic energy storage represents the consensus view of the basic flare mechanism. We have revisited the GOES soft X-ray flare statistics for any evidence of correlations, using two isolated active regions, and have found significant evidence for a ""saturation"" correlation. Rather than a ""reset"" form of this relaxation, in which the time \textitbefore a flare correlates with its magnitude, the ""saturation"" relationship results in the time \textitafter the flare showing the correlation. The observed correlation competes with the effect of reduced GOES sensitivity, in which weaker events can be under-reported systematically. This complicates the observed correlation, and we discuss several approaches to remedy this.",19,[],1
1909.11028,astro-ph,"Previous studies have related surface temperature maps, obtained with the Doppler imaging (DI) technique, of LQ Hya with long-term photometry. We compare surface magnetic field maps, obtained with the Zeeman Doppler imaging (ZDI) technique, with contemporaneous photometry, with the aim of quantifying the star's magnetic cycle characteristics. We inverted Stokes IV spectropolarimetry into magnetic field and surface brightness maps using a tomographic inversion code that models high signal-to-noise ratio mean line profiles produced by the least squares deconvolution (LSD) technique. The magnetic field and surface brightness maps reveal similar patterns to previous DI and ZDI studies: non-axisymmetric polar magnetic field structure, void of fields at mid-latitudes, and a complex structure in the equatorial regions. There is a weak but clear tendency of the polar structures to be linked with strong radial field and the equatorial ones with the azimuthal. We find a polarity reversal in the radial field between 2016 and 2017 coincident with an activity minimum seen in the long-term photometry. The inverted field strengths cannot easily be related with the observed spottedness, but we find that they are partially connected with the retrieved field complexity. Comparing to global magnetoconvection models for rapidly rotating young Suns, this field topology and dominance of the poloidal field component could be explained by a turbulent dynamo, where differential rotation does not play a major role (so called alpha2 Omega or alpha2 dynamos), and axi- and non-axisymmetric modes are excited simultaneously. The complex equatorial magnetic field structure could arise from the twisted (helical) wreaths often seen in these simulations, while the polar feature would be connected to the mostly poloidal non-axisymmetric component having a smooth spatial structure.",19,[],1
1902.07969,astro-ph,"We report on our three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of cylindrical weakly twisted flux tubes emerging from 18 Mm below the photosphere. We perform a parametric study, by varying the initial magnetic field strength (equation), radius (equation), twist (equation and length of the emerging part of the flux tube (equation) to investigate how these parameters affect the transfer of the magnetic field from the convection zone to the photosphere. We show that the efficiency of emergence at the photosphere (i.e. how strong the photospheric field will be in comparison to equation) depends not only on the equation but also the morphology of the emerging field and the twist. We show that parameters such as equation and magnetic flux cannot alone determine whether a flux tube will emerge to the solar surface. For instance, high-equation (weak-equation) fields may fail (succeed) to emerge at the photosphere, depending on their geometrical properties. We also show that the photospheric magnetic field strength can vary greatly for flux tubes with the same equation but different geometric properties. Moreover, in some cases we have found scaling laws, whereby the magnetic field strength scales with the local density as equation, where equation deeper in the convection zone and equation, close to the photosphere. The transition between the two values occurs approximately when the local pressure scale (equation) becomes comparable to the diameter of the flux tube (equation). We derive forms to explain how and when these scaling laws appear and compare them with the numerical simulations.",19,[],1
1910.06236,astro-ph,"[Abridged] We present the apparent stellar angular momentum of 300 galaxies across the Hubble sequence, using integral-field spectroscopic data from the CALIFA survey. Adopting the same equation parameter previously used to distinguish between slow and fast rotating early-type (elliptical and lenticular) galaxies, we show that spiral galaxies as expected are almost all fast rotators. Given the extent of our data, we provide relations for equation measured in different apertures, including conversions to long-slit 1D apertures. Our sample displays a wide range of equation values, consistent with previous IFS studies. The fastest rotators are dominated by relatively massive and highly star-forming Sb galaxies, which preferentially reside in the main star-forming sequence. These galaxies reach equation values of equation0.85, are the largest galaxies at a given mass, and display some of the strongest stellar population gradients. Compared to the population of S0 galaxies, our findings suggest that fading may not be the dominant mechanism transforming spirals into lenticulars. Interestingly, we find that equation decreases for late-type Sc and Sd spiral galaxies, with values than in occasions puts them in the slow-rotator regime. While for some of them this can be explained by their irregular morphologies and/or face-on configurations, others are edge-on systems with no signs of significant dust obscuration. The latter are typically at the low-mass end, but this does not explain their location in the classical (equation,equation) and (equation,equation) diagrams. Our initial investigations, based on dynamical models, suggest that these are dynamically hot disks, probably influenced by the observed important fraction of dark matter within Requation.",19,[],1

Because of the wide wavelength range used, our results substantially improve the accuracy and precision of previous extinction and effective temperature estimates. After cleaning our results for both unreliable input and output data, we retain 137 million stars, for which we achieve a median precision of 5% in distance, 0.20 mag in V-band extinction, and 245 K in effective temperature for G<14, degrading towards fainter magnitudes (12%, 0.20 mag, and 245 K at G=16; 16%, 0.23 mag, and 260 K at G=17, respectively). We find a very good agreement with the asteroseismic surface gravities and distances of 7000 stars in the Kepler, the K2-C3, and the K2-C6 fields, with stellar parameters from the APOGEE survey, as well as with distances to star clusters. Our results are available through the ADQL query interface of the Gaia mirror at the Leibniz-Institut fur Astrophysik Potsdam (gaia.aip.de) and as binary tables at data.aip.de. As a first application, in this paper we provide distance- and extinction-corrected colour-magnitude diagrams, extinction maps as a function of distance, and extensive density maps, demonstrating the potential of our value-added dataset for mapping the three-dimensional structure of our Galaxy. In particular, we see a clear manifestation of the Galactic bar in the stellar density distributions, an observation that can almost be considered a direct imaging of the Galactic bar.",19,[],1
1904.00695,astro-ph,"At equation, star-formation activity is thought to be high even in high-density environments such as galaxy clusters and proto-clusters. One of the critical but outstanding issues is if structural growth of star-forming galaxies can differ depending on their surrounding environments. In order to investigate how galaxies grow their structures and what physical processes are involved in the evolution of galaxies, one requires spatially resolved images of not only stellar components but also star-forming regions within galaxies. We conducted the Adaptive Optics(AO)-assisted imaging observations for star-forming galaxies in a dense proto-cluster core at equation with IRCS and AO188 mounted on the Subaru Telescope. A combination of AO and narrow-band filters allows us to obtain resolved maps of Hequation-emitting regions with an angular resolution of 0.1--0.2~arcsec, which corresponds to equation kpc at equation. Based on stacking analyses, we compare radial profiles of star-forming regions and stellar components and find that the star-forming region of a sub-sample with equation is more extended than the stellar component, indicating the inside-out growth of the structure. This trend is similar to the one for star-forming galaxies in general fields at equation obtained with the same observational technique. Our results suggest that the structural evolution of star-forming galaxies at equation is mainly driven by internal secular processes irrespective of surrounding environments.",19,[],1
1905.08516,astro-ph,"We present an extended grid of state-of-the art stellar models for low-mass stars including updated physics (nuclear reaction rates, surface boundary condition, mass-loss rate, angular momentum transport, torque and rotation-induced mixing prescriptions).   We aim at evaluating the impact of wind braking, realistic atmospheric treatment, rotation and rotation-induced mixing on the structural and rotational evolution from the pre-main sequence to the turn-off.   Using the STAREVOL code, we provide an updated PMS grid. We compute stellar models for 7 different metallicities, from [Fe/H] = -1 dex to [Fe/H] = 0.3 dex with a solar composition corresponding to equation. The initial stellar mass ranges from 0.2 to 1.5\Ms with extra grid refinement around one solar mass. We also provide rotating models for three different initial rotation rates (slow, median and fast) with prescriptions for the wind braking and disc-coupling timescale calibrated on observed properties of young open clusters. The rotational mixing includes an up-to-date description of the turbulence anisotropy in stably stratified regions.   The overall behaviour of our models at solar metallicity -- and its constitutive physics -- is validated through a detailed comparison with a variety of distributed evolutionary tracks. The main differences arise from the choice of surface boundary conditions and initial solar composition.   The models including rotation with our prescription for angular momentum extraction and self-consistent formalism for angular momentum transport are able to reproduce the rotation period distribution observed in young open clusters over a broad mass-range.   These models are publicly available and may be used to analyse data coming from present and forthcoming asteroseismic and spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, TESS and PLATO.",19,[],1
1903.05026,astro-ph,"Galaxy evolution is driven by many complex interrelated processes as galaxies accrete gas, form new stars, grow their stellar masses and central black holes, and subsequently quench. The processes that drive these transformations is poorly understood, but it is clear that the local environment on multiple scales plays a significant role. Today's massive clusters are dominated by spheroidal galaxies with low levels of star formation while those in the field are mostly still actively forming their stars. In order to understand the physical processes that drive both the mass build up in galaxies and the quenching of star formation, we need to investigate galaxies and their surrounding gas within and around the precursors of today's massive galaxy clusters -- protoclusters at z>2. The transition period before protoclusters began to quench and become the massive clusters we observe today is a crucial time to investigate their properties and the mechanisms driving their evolution. However, until now, progress characterizing the galaxies within protoclusters has been slow, due the difficulty of obtaining highly complete spectroscopic observations of faint galaxies at z>2 over large areas of the sky. The next decade will see a transformational shift in our understanding of protoclusters as deep spectroscopy over wide fields of view will be possible in conjunction with high resolution deep imaging in the optical and near-infrared.",19,[],1
1911.11953,astro-ph,"We present the analysis of the microlensing event OGLE-2016-BLG-1227. The light curve of this short-duration event appears to be a single-lens event affected by severe finite-source effects. Analysis of the light curve based on single-lens single-source (1L1S) modeling yields very small values of the event timescale, equation days, and the angular Einstein radius, equation mas, making the lens a candidate of a free-floating planet. Close inspection reveals that the 1L1S solution leaves small residuals with amplitude equation mag. We find that the residuals are explained by the existence of an additional widely-separated heavier lens component, indicating that the lens is a wide-separation planetary system rather than a free-floating planet. From Bayesian analysis, it is estimated that the planet has a mass of equation and it is orbiting a low-mass host star with a mass of equation located with a projected separation of equation au. The planetary system is located in the Galactic bulge with a line-of-sight separation from the source star of equation kpc.

1904.08440,astro-ph,"Certain planetary nebulae contain shells, filaments, or globules of cold gas and dust whose heating and chemistry are likely driven by UV and X-ray emission from their central stars and from wind-collision-generated shocks. We present the results of a survey of molecular line emission in the 88-236 GHz range from nine nearby (<1.5 kpc) planetary nebulae spanning a range of UV and X-ray luminosities, using the 30 m telescope of the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimetrique. Rotational transitions of thirteen molecules, including CO isotopologues and chemically important trace species, were observed and the results compared with and augmented by previous studies of molecular gas in PNe. Lines of the molecules HCO, HNC, HCN, and CN, which were detected in most objects, represent new detections for five planetary nebulae in our study. Specifically, we present the first detections of 13CO (1-0, 2-1), HCO, CN, HCN, and HNC in NGC 6445; HCO in BD303639; 13CO (2-1), CN, HCN, and HNC in NGC 6853; and 13CO (2-1) and CN in NGC 6772. Flux ratios were analyzed to identify correlations between the central star and/or nebular UV and X-ray luminosities and the molecular chemistries of the nebulae. This analysis reveals a surprisingly robust dependence of the HNC/HCN line ratio on PN central star UV luminosity. There exists no such clear correlation between PN X-rays and various diagnostics of PN molecular chemistry. The correlation between HNC/HCN ratio and central star UV luminosity demonstrates the potential of molecular emission line studies of PNe for improving our understanding of the role that high-energy radiation plays in the heating and chemistry of photodissociation regions.",19,[],1

S190425z is a likely binary neutron star (BNS) merger at equation Mpc, while S190426c is possibly the first NS-BH merger ever detected, at equation Mpc, although with marginal statistical significance. Here we report our optical follow-up observations for both events using the MMT 6.5-m telescope, as well as our spectroscopic follow-up of candidate counterparts (which turned out to be unrelated) with the 4.1-m SOAR telescope. We compare to publicly reported searches, explore the overall areal coverage and depth, and evaluate those in relation to the optical/NIR kilonova emission from the BNS merger GW170817, to theoretical kilonova models, and to short GRB afterglows. We find that for a GW170817-like kilonova, the partial volume covered spans up to about 40% for S190425z and 60% for S190426c. For an on-axis jet typical of short GRBs, the search effective volume is larger, but such a configuration is expected in at most a few percent of mergers. We further find that wide-field equation-ray and X-ray limits rule out luminous on-axis SGRBs, for a large fraction of the localization regions, although these searches are not sufficiently deep in the context of the equation-ray emission from GW170817 or off-axis SGRB afterglows. The results indicate that some optical follow-up searches are sufficiently deep for counterpart identification to about 300 Mpc, but that localizations better than 1000 degequation are likely essential.",19,[],1

Together with observations from the wide-field Mitchell IFS at McDonald Observatory in our earlier work, we obtain unprecedentedly detailed kinematic maps of local massive ETGs, covering a scale of equation kpc. The high (equation) signal-to-noise of the GMOS spectra enable us to obtain two-dimensional maps of the line-of-sight velocity, velocity dispersion equation, as well as the skewness equation and kurtosis equation of the stellar velocity distributions. All but one galaxy in the sample have equation profiles that increase towards the center, whereas the slope of equation at one effective radius (equation) can be of either sign. The equation is generally positive, with 14 of the 20 galaxies having positive equation within the GMOS aperture and 18 having positive equation within equation. The positive equation and rising equation towards small radii are indicative of a central black hole and velocity anisotropy. We demonstrate the constraining power of the data on the mass distributions in ETGs by applying Jeans anisotropic modeling (JAM) to NGC~1453, the most regular fast rotator in the sample.

After dividing the Galactic halo into an inner-halo region (IHR) and outer-halo region (OHR), based on the spatial variation of carbon-to-iron ratios in the sample, we find that stars in the OHR exhibit a clear retrograde motion of equation49 equation 4 km sequation and a more spherical distribution of stellar orbits, while stars in the IHR have zero net rotation (equation3 equation 1 km sequation) with a much more radially biased distribution of stellar orbits. Furthermore, we classify the carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars among the MSTO sample in each halo component into CEMP-no and CEMP-equation sub-classes, based on their absolute carbon abundances, equation(C), and examine the spatial distributions and kinematics associated with each sub-class. The CEMP-no stars are the majority sub-class of CEMP stars in the OHR (equation 65%), and the minority sub-class in the IHR (equation 44%), similar to the results of several previous analyses. The CEMP-no stars in each halo region exhibit slightly higher counter-rotation than the CEMP-equation stars, but within statistical errors. The CEMP-no stars also show a more spherical distribution of orbits than the CEMP-equation stars in each halo region. These distinct characteristics provide strong evidence that numerous low-mass satellite galaxies (similar to the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies) have donated stars to the OHR, while more-massive dwarf galaxies provided the dominant contribution to the IHR.",19,[],1

Via spectral energy distribution fitting to the data with YSO radiative transfer models we refine this list, identifying 105 high-confidence and 88 medium-confidence YSO candidates. For these sources we constrain their evolutionary state and estimate their physical properties. The majority of our YSO candidates are massive protostars with an accreting envelope in the initial stages of formation. We fit the mass distribution of the Stage I YSOs with a Kroupa initial mass function and determine a global star-formation rate of 0.039 equation. This is higher than star-formation rate estimates based on integrated UV fluxes. The new YSO candidates are preferentially located in clusters which correspond to seven active high-mass star-formation regions which are strongly correlated with the 8 and 24 equationm emission from PAHs and warm dust. This analysis reveals an embedded high-mass star-formation region, Spitzer I, which hosts the highest number of massive YSO candidates in NGC 6822.

Probing the physical properties of galaxies at equation is challenging due to the inherent faintness of such sources and the limited wavelength coverage available. Thanks to the high equation2-6equation lensing magnification of the multiple images of MACS0647-JD, we can use the sensitive Spitzer/IRAC data to probe the rest-frame optical fluxes of MACS0647-JD and investigate its physical properties including the age and the stellar mass. In deriving Spitzer/IRAC fluxes for MACS0647-JD, great care is taken in coping with the impact of three bright (equation8-16 mag) stars in our field to ensure robust results.

We use deep near-infrared images from the Nordic Optical Telescope and the ESO VLT to analyze the surface brightness distribution of the galaxies in the sample. We detected 72% of the hosts (24% classified as gamma-NLSy1s). Although we cannot rule out that some RL-NLSy1s are hosted by dispersion supported systems, our findings strongly indicate that RL-NLSy1s hosts are preferentially disc galaxies. 52% of the resolved hosts (77% non-gamma-emitters and 20% gamma-emitters) show bars with morphological properties (long and weak) consistent with models that promote gas inflows, which might trigger nuclear activity. The extremely red bulges of the gamma-NLSy1s, and features that suggest minor mergers in 75% of their hosts might hint to the necessary conditions for gamma-rays to be produced. Among the features that suggest mergers in our sample, we find 6 galaxies that show offset stellar bulges with respect to their AGN. When we plot the nuclear versus the bulge magnitude, RL-NLSy1s locate in the low-luminosity end of flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), suggesting a similar accretion mode between these two AGN types.",19,[],1
1903.10050,astro-ph,"The energy loss of a rotationally powered pulsar is primarily carried away as electromagnetic radiation and a particle wind. Considering that the magnetic field strength of pulsars ranges from about equation to equation G, one could expect quantum electrodynamics (QED) to play a role in their spin-down, especially for strongly magnetized ones (magnetars). In fact several authors have argued that QED corrections will dominate the spin-down for slowly rotating stars. They called this effect quantum vacuum friction (QVF). However, QVF was originally derived using a problematic self-torque technique, which leads to a dramatic overestimation of this spin-down effect. Here, instead of using QVF, we explicitly calculate the energy loss from rotating neutron stars using the Poynting vector and a model for a particle wind, and we include the QED one-loop corrections. We express the excess emission as QED one-loop corrections to the radiative magnetic moment of a neutron star. We do find a small component of the spin-down luminosity that originates from the vacuum polarization. However, it never exceeds one percent of the classical magnetic dipole radiation in neutron stars for all physically interesting field strengths. Therefore, we find that the radiative corrections of QED are irrelevant in the energetics of neutron-star spin-down.",19,[],1
1901.08475,astro-ph,"We propose an alternative physical mechanism to explain the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe based on the configuration entropy of the cosmic web and its evolution. We show that the sheets, filaments and clusters in the cosmic web act as sinks whereas the voids act as the sources of information. The differential entropy of the cosmic velocity field increases with time and also acts as a source of entropy. The growth of non-linear structures and the emergence of the cosmic web may lead to a situation where the overall dissipation rate of information at the sinks are about to dominate the generation rate of information from the sources. Consequently, the Universe either requires a dispersal of the overdense non-linear structures or an accelerated expansion of the underdense voids to prevent a violation of the second law of thermodynamics. The dispersal of the sheets, filaments and clusters are not a viable option due to the attractive nature of gravity but the repulsive and outward peculiar gravitational acceleration at the voids makes it easier to stretch them at an accelerated rate. We argue that this accelerated expansion of the voids inside the cosmic web may mimic the behaviour of dark energy.",19,[],1
1908.02226,astro-ph,"Aims. Our aim is to examine the solar cycle variability of magnetically simple and complex active region. Methods. We studied simple (equation and equation) and complex (equation and equation) active regions based on the Mount Wilson magnetic classification by applying our newly developed daily approach. We analyzed the daily number of the simple active regions (SARs) and compared that to the abundance of the complex active regions (CARs) over the entire solar cycle 23 and cycle 24 until December 2018. Results. We show that CARs evolve differently over the solar cycle from SARs. The time evolution of SARs and CARs on different hemispheres also shows differences, even though on average their latitudinal distributions are shown to be similar. The time evolution of SARs closely follows that of the sunspot number, and their maximum abundance was observed to occur during the early maximum phase, while that of the CARs was seen roughly two years later. We furthermore found that the peak of CARs was reached before the latitudinal width of the activity band starts to decease. Conclusions. Our results suggest that the active region formation process is a competition between the large-scale dynamo (LSD) and the small-scale dynamo (SSD) near the surface, the former varying cyclically and the latter being independent of the solar cycle. During solar maximum, LSD is dominant, giving a preference to SARs, while during the declining phase the relative role of SSD increases. Therefore, a preference for CARs is seen due to the influence of the SSD on the emerging flux.",19,[],1
1904.00108,astro-ph,"Studying the physical processes occurring in the region just above the magnetic poles of strongly magnetized, accreting binary neutron stars is essential to our understanding of stellar and binary system evolution. Perhaps more importantly, it provides us with a natural laboratory for studying the physics of high temperature and high density plasmas exposed to extreme radiation, gravitational, and magnetic fields. Observations over the past decade have shed new light on the manner in which plasma falling at velocities near the speed of light onto a neutron star surface is halted. Recent advances in modeling these processes have resulted in direct measurement of the magnetic fields and plasma properties. On the other hand, numerous physical processes have been identified that challenge our current picture of how the accretion process onto neutron stars works. Observation and theory are our essential tools in this regime because the extreme conditions cannot be duplicated on Earth. This white paper gives an overview of the current theory, the outstanding theoretical and observational challenges, and the importance of addressing them in contemporary astrophysics research.",19,[],1
1909.06699,astro-ph,"We investigate ongoing accretion activity in young stars in the TW Hydrae association (TWA, ~8-10 Myr), an ideal target to probe the final stages of disk accretion down to brown dwarf masses. Our sample comprises eleven TWA members with infrared excess, amounting to 85% of the total TWA population with disks, with spectral types between M0 and M9, and masses between 0.58 and 0.02 Msol. We employed homogeneous spectroscopic data from 300 to 2500 nm, obtained with X-shooter, to derive individual extinction, stellar parameters, and accretion parameters simultaneously. We then examined Balmer lines and forbidden emission lines to probe the physics of the star-disk interaction environment. We detected signatures of ongoing accretion for 70% of our TWA targets. This implies a fraction of accretors of 13-17% across the entire TWA (accounting for potentially accreting members not included in our survey). The spectral emission associated with these stars reveals a more evolved stage of these accretors compared to younger PMS populations: (i) a large fraction (~50%) exhibit nearly symmetric, narrow Halpha line profiles; (ii) over 80% exhibit Balmer decrements consistent with moderate accretion and optically thin emission; (iii) less than a third exhibit forbidden line emission in [O I] 6300A, indicative of winds and outflows activity. However, the distribution in accretion rates (Mdot) derived for the TWA sample follows closely that of younger regions for Mstar~0.1-0.3 Msun. An overall correlation between Mdot and Mstar is detected, best reproduced by Mdot~Mstar(2.1/-0.5). At least in the lowest Mstar regimes, stars that still retain a disk at ages ~8-10 Myr are found to exhibit statistically similar, albeit moderate, accretion levels as those measured around younger objects. This slow Mdot evolution may be associated with longer evolutionary timescales of disks around low-mass stars.",19,[],1
1905.04475,astro-ph,"We report our measurements of the bulk radial velocity from a sample of small, metal-rich ejecta knots in Kepler's Supernova Remnant (SNR). We measure the Doppler shift of the He-like Si Kequation line center energy in the spectra of these knots based on our equation High-Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) observation to estimate their radial velocities. We estimate high radial velocities of up to equation 8,000 km sequation for some of these ejecta knots. We also measure proper motions for our sample based on the archival equation Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) data taken in 2000, 2006, and 2014. Our measured radial velocities and proper motions indicate that some of these ejecta knots are almost freely-expanding after equation 400 years since the explosion. The fastest moving knots show proper motions up to equation 0.2 arcseconds per year. Assuming that these high velocity ejecta knots are traveling ahead of the forward shock of the SNR, we estimate the distance to Kepler's SNR equation equation 4.4 to 7.5 kpc. We find that the ejecta knots in our sample have an average space velocity of equation 4,600 km sequation (at a distance of 6 kpc). We note that 8 out of the 15 ejecta knots from our sample show a statistically significant (at the 90equation confidence level) redshifted spectrum, compared to only two with a blueshifted spectrum. This may suggest an asymmetry in the ejecta distribution in Kepler's SNR along the line of sight, however a larger sample size is required to confirm this result.",19,[],1
1908.06530,astro-ph,"Stars spend most of their lifetimes on the `main sequence' (MS) in the Hertzsprung--Russell diagram. The obvious double MSs seen in the equivalent color--magnitude diagrams characteristic of Milky Way open clusters pose a fundamental challenge to our traditional understanding of star clusters as `single stellar populations.' The clear MS bifurcation of early-type stars with masses greater than equation is thought to result from a range in the stellar rotation rates. However, direct evidence connecting double MSs to stellar rotation properties has yet to emerge. Here, we show through analysis of the projected stellar rotational velocities (equation, where equation represents the star's inclination angle) that the well-separated double MS in the young, equation-old Milky Way open cluster NGC 2287 is tightly correlated with a dichotomous distribution of stellar rotation rates. We discuss whether our observations may reflect the effects of tidal locking affecting a fraction of the cluster's member stars in stellar binary systems. We show that the slow rotators could potentially be initially rapidly rotating stars that have been slowed down by tidal locking by a low mass-ratio companion in a cluster containing a large fraction of short-period, low-mass-ratio binaries. This demonstrates that stellar rotation drives the split MSs in young, equationMyr-old star clusters. However, special conditions, e.g., as regards the mass-ratio distribution, might be required for this scenario to hold.",19,[],1
1902.04585,astro-ph,"Cosmic voids are the major volume component in the matter distribution of the Universe. They posses great potential for constraining dark energy as well as for testing theories of gravity. Nevertheless, in spite of their growing popularity as cosmological probes, a gap of knowledge between cosmic void observations and theory still persists. In particular, the void size function models proposed in literature have been proven unsuccessful in reproducing the results obtained from cosmological simulations in which cosmic voids are detected from biased tracers of the density field, undermining the possibility of using them as cosmological probes. The goal of this work is to cover this gap. In particular, we make use of the findings of a previous work in which we have improved the void selection procedure, presenting an algorithm that redefines the void ridges and, consequently, their radius. By applying this algorithm, we validate the volume conserving model of the void size function on a set of unbiased simulated density field tracers. We highlight the difference in the internal structure between voids selected in this way and those identified by the popular VIDE void finder. We also extend the validation of the model to the case of biased tracers. We find that a relation exists between the tracer used to sample the underlying dark matter density field and its unbiased counterpart. Moreover, we demonstrate that, as long as this relation is accounted for, the size function is a viable approach for studying cosmology with cosmic voids.",19,[],1

1909.06735,astro-ph,"The radius-luminosity (R-L) relationship of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) established by the reverberation mapping (RM) observations has been widely used as a single-epoch black hole mass estimator in the research of large AGN samples. However, the recent RM campaigns discovered that the AGNs with high accretion rates show shorter time lags by factors of a few comparing with the predictions from the R-L relationship. The explanation of the shortened time lags has not been finalized yet. We collect 8 different single-epoch spectral properties to investigate how the shortening of the time lags correlate with those properties and to understand what is the origin of the shortened lags. We find that the flux ratio between Fe II and Hequation emission lines shows the most prominent correlation, thus confirm that accretion rate is the main driver for the shortened lags. In addition, we establish a new scaling relation including the relative strength of Fe II emission. This new scaling relation can provide less biased estimates of the black hole mass and accretion rate from the single-epoch spectra of AGNs.",19,[],1
1910.04111,astro-ph,"Molecular nitrogen is the most commonly assumed background gas that supports habitability on rocky planets. Despite its chemical inertness, nitrogen molecule is broken by lightning, hot volcanic vents, and bolide impacts, and can be converted into soluble nitrogen compounds and then sequestered in the ocean. The very stability of nitrogen, and that of nitrogen-based habitability, is thus called into question. Here we determine the lifetime of molecular nitrogen vis-a-vis aqueous sequestration, by developing a novel model that couples atmospheric photochemistry and oceanic chemistry. We find that HNO, the dominant nitrogen compounds produced in anoxic atmospheres, is converted to N2O in the ocean, rather than oxidized to nitrites or nitrates as previously assumed. This N2O is then released back into the atmosphere and quickly converted to N2. We also find that the deposition rate of NO is severely limited by the kinetics of the aqueous-phase reaction that converts NO to nitrites in the ocean. Putting these insights together, we conclude that the atmosphere must produce nitrogen species at least as oxidized as NO2 and HNO2 to enable aqueous sequestration. The lifetime of molecular nitrogen in anoxic atmospheres is determined to be >1 billion years on temperate planets of both Sun-like and M dwarf stars. This result upholds the validity of molecular nitrogen as a universal background gas on rocky planets.",19,[],1
1901.00407,astro-ph,"We present the latest results of our spectroscopic observations and refined modelling of a sample of detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs), selected from the equation Eclipsing Binary Catalog, that are also double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2).

All the obtained radial velocities (RVs) were combined with equation photometry, in order to derive a full set of orbital and physical parameters.   Ten out of eleven SB2s have their component spectra tomographically disentangled, and spectral analysis was performed with iSpec, in order to derive effective temperatures of components and metallicities of the systems. By comparing our results with theoretical models, we assess the age and evolutionary status of the studied objects. We find a good match to all but one systems.

1902.04172,astro-ph,"Rotating stellar convection transports angular momentum towards the equator, generating the characteristic equatorial acceleration of the solar rotation while the radial flux of angular momentum is always inwards. New numerical box simulations for the meridional cross-correlation equation, however, reveal the angular momentum transport towards the poles for slow rotation and towards the equator for fast rotation. The explanation is that for slow rotation a negative radial gradient of the angular velocity always appears, which in combination with a so-far neglected rotation-induced off-diagonal eddy viscosity term equation provides ""antisolar rotation"" laws with a decelerated equator. Similarly, the simulations provided positive values for the rotation-induced correlation equation, which is relevant for the resulting latitudinal temperature profiles (cool or warm poles) for slow rotation and negative values for fast rotation. Observations of the differential rotation of slowly rotating stars will therefore lead to a better understanding of the actual stress-strain relation, the heat transport, and the underlying rotating convection.",19,[],1
1902.05571,astro-ph,"We report on the latest six pulsars discovered through our standard pipeline in the intermediate-latitude region (b < 15 deg) of the Parkes High Time Resolution Universe Survey (HTRU).

Highlights of the presented sample include the isolated millisecond pulsar J1826-2415, the long-period binary pulsar J1837-0822 in a mildly eccentric 98-day orbit with a > 0.27 Msun companion, and the nulling pulsar J1638-4233, detected only 10% of the time. Other interesting objects are PSR J1757-1500, exhibiting sporadic mode changes, and PSR J1635-2616 showing one glitch over 6 years. The new discoveries bring the total count of HTRU intermediate-latitude pulsars to 113, 25% of which are recycled pulsars. This is the higest ratio of recycled over ordinary pulsars discoveries of all recent pulsar surveys in this region of the sky. Among HTRU recycled pulsars, four are isolated objects. Comparing the characteristics of Galactic fully-recycled isolated MSPs with those of eclipsing binaries ('spiders'), from which the former are believed to have formed, we highlight a discrepancy in their spatial distribution. This may reflect a difference in the natal kick, hence, possibly, a different formation path.

1910.07007,astro-ph,"Many more supernova remnants (SNRs) are now known in external galaxies than in the Milky Way. Most of these SNRs have been identified using narrow-band imaging, separating SNRs from HII regions on the basis of [SII]:H-alpha ratios that are elevated compared to HII regions. However, the boundary between SNRs and HII regions is not always distinct, especially at low surface brightness. Here we explore velocity structure as a possible criterion for separating SNRs from HII regions, using a sample of well-studied SNRs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) as well as a small number of SNRs in the galaxy M83. We find, perhaps not surprisingly, that even at large diameters, SNRs exhibit velocity broadening sufficient to readily distinguish them from HII regions. We thus suggest that the purity of most extragalactic samples would be greatly improved through spectroscopic observations with a velocity resolution of order 50~km/s$.",19,[],1

Two parts of gamma-ray emission from the region is clearly resolved, which correspond to the north-east (NE) and south-west (SW) limbs of the SNR. The former was detected in the previous LAT data (Xing et al. 2016), but the latter is newly detected in this work. The detection of the two limbs are at a 4 sigma significance level, and the spectral results for the NE limb is consistent with those obtained in previous detection analyses. We construct the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) for the SW limb. Different scenarios are considered for the SED in gamma-ray energies. We conclude very similar to that of the NE limb, the high-energy and very high-energy emission from the SW limb is likely dominated by the leptonic process, in which high-energy electrons accelerated from the shell region of the SNR inverse-Compton scatter background photons to gamma-rays.",19,[],1
1907.00071,astro-ph,"We propose a new tomographic estimator for the gravitational lensing potential, based on a combination of intensity mapping (IM) and galaxy number counts. The estimator can be written schematically as IMequationgalaxy equation galaxyequationIM; this combination allows to greatly reduce the contamination by density-density correlations, thus isolating the lensing signal. As a pure cross-correlation estimator, it is additionally less susceptible to systematic effects. We show that the new estimator strongly suppresses cosmic variance and consequently improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the detection of lensing, especially on linear scales and intermediate redshifts. For cosmic variance dominated surveys the SNR of our estimator is a factor 30 larger than the SNR obtained from the correlation of galaxy number counts only. Shot noise and interferometer noise reduce the SNR. For the specific example of DES cross-correlated with HIRAX, the SNR is around 4, whereas for Euclid cross-correlated with HIRAX it reaches 52. This corresponds to an improvement of a factor 4-5 compared to the SNR from DES alone. For Euclid cross-correlated with HIRAX the improvement with respect to Euclid alone strongly depends on the redshift. We find that the improvement is particularly important for redshifts below 1.6, where it reaches 5. This makes our estimator especially valuable to test dark energy and modified gravity, that are expected to leave an impact at low and intermediate redshifts.",19,[],1

1911.05791,astro-ph,"The existence of equation109 Msun supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the first billion year of the universe has stimulated numerous ideas for the prompt formation and rapid growth of BHs in the early universe. Here we review ways in which the seeds of massive BHs may have first assembled, how they may have subsequently grown as massive as equation109 Msun, and how multi-messenger observations could distinguish between different SMBH assembly scenarios. We conclude the following: (1) The ultra-rare equation109 Msun SMBHs represent only the tip of the iceberg. Early BHs likely fill a continuum from stellar-mass (approx. 10 Msun) to the super-massive (equation109 Msun) regime, reflecting a range of initial masses and growth histories. (2) Stellar-mass BHs were likely left behind by the first generation of stars at redshifts as high as z=30, but their initial growth was typically stunted due to the shallow potential wells of their host galaxies. (3) Conditions in some larger, metal-poor galaxies soon became conducive to the rapid formation and growth of massive `seed' holes, via gas accretion and by mergers in dense stellar clusters. (4) BH masses depend on the environment (such as the number and properties of nearby radiation sources and the local baryonic streaming velocity), and on the metal enrichment and assembly history of the host galaxy. (5) Distinguishing between assembly mechanisms will be difficult, but a combination of observations by LISA (probing massive BH growth via mergers) and by deep multi-wavelength electromagnetic observations (probing growth via gas accretion) is particularly promising.",19,[],1

A total of 186 GRBs are found; of these, 91 show emission in the range equationMeV (17 of which are seen only in this band) and 169 are detected above 100 MeV. Most of these sources were discovered by other instruments (equation/GBM, equation/BAT, AGILE, INTEGRAL) or reported by the Interplanetary Network (IPN); the LAT has independently triggered on 4 GRBs. This catalog presents the results for all 186 GRBs. We study onset, duration and temporal properties of each GRB, as well as spectral characteristics in the equationMeVequationGeV energy range. Particular attention is given to the photons with highest energy. Compared with the first LAT GRB catalog, our rate of detection is significantly improved. The results generally confirm the main findings of the first catalog: the LAT primarily detects the brightest GBM bursts, and the high-energy emission shows delayed onset as well as longer duration. However, in this work we find delays exceeding 1 ks, and several GRBs with durations over 10 ks. Furthermore, the larger number of LAT detections shows that these GRBs cover not only the high-fluence range of GBM-detected GRBs, but also samples lower fluences. In addition, the greater number of detected GRBs with redshift estimates allows us to study their properties in both the observer and rest frames.

The dense stellar background will lead to an increase in the number of occultations, while the Gaia DR2 catalogue will reduce the prediction uncertainties for the shadow path.   Aims. We observed a stellar occultation by the Galilean moon Europa (J2) and propose a campaign for observing stellar occultations for all Galilean moons.   Methods. During a predicted period of time, we measured the light flux of the occulted star and the object to determine the time when the flux dropped with respect to one or more reference stars, and the time that it rose again for each observational station. The chords obtained from these observations allowed us to determine apparent sizes, oblatness, and positions with kilometre accuracy.   Results. We present results obtained from the first stellar occultation by the Galilean moon Europa observed on 2017 March 31. The apparent fitted ellipse presents an equivalent radius of 1561.2 equation 3.6 km and oblatenesses 0.0010 equation 0.0028.

Stellar occultation is a suitable technique for obtaining physical parameters and highly accurate positions of bright satellites close to their primary.

1901.06391,astro-ph,"Stellar population synthesis (SPS) models have long struggled to reproduce observed optical through near-IR (NIR) spectral energy distributions (SED) of massive quiescent galaxies. We revisit this issue using a novel approach that combines the diagnostic power of full-spectrum fitting with recently updated stellar spectral libraries. First, we perform full-spectrum fitting of continuum-normalized stacked SDSS spectra in bins of velocity dispersion to infer their stellar population properties, such as the elemental abundances and age. Next, we use the resulting best-fit parameters to compute equation colors, which are then compared to observed colors of the same galaxies. With this approach we are able to predict the equation SEDs of low and high mass galaxies at the equation mag level in nearly all cases. We find that the full optical through NIR SEDs of quiescent galaxies can be reproduced only when the spectrum is fit with a flexibility that is able to capture the behavior of the entire optical absorption line spectrum. The models include variations in individual elemental abundances, nebular emission lines, and the presence of young stellar components. The successful prediction of the SED shape from continuum-normalized spectra implies that the continuum information is largely contained in the narrow absorption features. These results also imply that attempts to model broadband photometry of quiescent systems will suffer from potentially significant biases if the detailed abundance patterns are not taken into account.",19,[],1

We find that galaxy color gradients at fixed mass evolve rapidly between z~2.5 and z~1, but remain roughly constant below z~1. This result implies that the sizes of both star-forming and quiescent galaxies increase much more slowly than previous studies found using half-light radii. The half-mass radius evolution of quiescent galaxies is fully consistent with a model which uses observed minor merger rates to predict the increase in sizes due to the accretion of small galaxies. Progenitor bias may still contribute to the growth of quiescent galaxies, particularly if we assume a slower timescale for the minor merger growth model. The slower half-mass radius evolution of star-forming galaxies is in tension with cosmological simulations and semi-analytic galaxy models.

We have used the Low-Band Antennas of the LOFAR core stations to observe 87 pulsars out of 158 that have been detected previously with the High-Band Antennas. Forty-three pulsars have been detected and we present here their flux densities and flux-calibrated profiles. Seventeen of these pulsars have not been, to our knowledge, detected before at such low frequencies. We re-calculate the spectral indices using the new low-frequency flux density measurements from the LOFAR census and discuss the prospects of studying pulsars at the very low frequencies with the current and upcoming facilities, such as NenuFAR.",19,[],1
1902.08526,astro-ph,"Current time domain facilities are discovering hundreds of new galactic and extra-galactic transients every week. Classifying the ever-increasing number of transients is challenging, yet crucial to further our understanding of their nature, discover new classes, or ensuring sample purity, for instance, for Supernova Ia cosmology. The Zwicky Transient Facility is one example of such a survey. In addition, it has a dedicated very-low resolution spectrograph, the SEDMachine, operating on the Palomar 60-inch telescope. This spectrograph's primary aim is object classification. In practice most, if not all, transients of interest brighter than ~19 mag are typed. This corresponds to approximately 10 to 15 targets a night. In this paper, we present a fully automated pipeline for the SEDMachine. This pipeline has been designed to be fast, robust, stable and extremely flexible. pysedm enables the fully automated spectral extraction of a targeted point source object in less than 5 minutes after the end of the exposure. The spectral color calibration is accurate at the few percent level. In the 19 weeks since pysedm entered production in early August of 2018, we have classified, among other objects, about 400 Type Ia supernovae and 140 Type II supernovae. We conclude that low resolution, fully automated spectrographs such as the `SEDMachine with pysedm' installed on 2-m class telescopes within the southern hemisphere could allow us to automatically and simultaneously type and obtain a redshift for most (if not all) bright transients detected by LSST within z<0.2, notably potentially all Type Ia Supernovae. In comparison to the current SEDM design, this would require higher spectral resolution (R~1000) and slightly improved throughput. With this perspective in mind, pysedm has been designed to easily be adaptable to any IFU-like spectrograph (see https://github.com/MickaelRigault/pysedm).",19,[],1
1901.04357,astro-ph,"X-ray reverberation in Active Galactic Nuclei, believed to be the result of the reprocessing of coronal photons by the underlying accretion disc, has allowed us to probe the properties of the inner-most regions of the accretion flow and the central black hole. Our current model (KYNREFREV) computes the time-dependent reflection spectra of the disc as a response to a flash of primary power-law radiation from a point source corona located on the axis of the black hole accretion disc (lamp-post geometry). Full relativistic effects are taken into account. The ionization of the disc is set for each radius according to the amount of the incident primary flux and the density of the accretion disc. We detect wavy residuals around the best-fit reverberation model time lags at high frequencies. This result suggests that the simple lamp-post geometry does not fully explain the X-ray source/disc configuration in Active Galactic Nuclei. There has been a noticeable progress into the development of codes for extended coronae (Wilkins16, Chainakun & Young 2017, Taylor & Reynolds 2018a,b). Indeed, the model from Chainakun & Young (2017), consisting of two axial point sources illuminating an accretion disc that produce the reverberation lags is able to reproduce the observed time-lag versus frequency spectra. The goal of this paper is to observationally justify the need for an extended corona in order to provide (in the near future) with a mathematical formulation of a model for an extended corona in its simplest form.",19,[],1
1901.07814,astro-ph,"[Abridged] We investigated the X-ray characteristics of the Class I YSO Elias 29 with joint XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations of 300 ks and 450 ks, respectively. These are the first observations of a very young (<1 Myr) stellar object in a band encompassing simultaneously both soft and hard X-rays. In addition to the hot Fe complex at 6.7 keV, we observed fluorescent emission from Fe at equation keV, confirming the previous findings. The line at 6.4 keV is detected during quiescent and flaring states and its flux is variable. The equivalent width is found varying in the equation keV range. These values make unrealistic a simple model with a centrally illuminated disk and suggest a role of the cavity containing Elias 29 and possibly reverberation processes that could occur in it. We observed two flares, with duration of 20 ks and 50 ks, respectively. We systematically observed an increase of equation during the flares of a factor five. This behavior has been observed during flares previously detected in Elias 29 with XMM-Newton and ASCA. The phenomenon hints that the flaring regions could be buried under the accretion streams and at high stellar latitudes, as the X-rays from flares pass through gas denser than the gas along the line of sight of the quiescent corona. In a different scenario, a contribution from scattered soft photons to the primary coronal emission could mimic a shallower equation in the quiescent spectrum. In the spectrum of the full NuSTAR exposure, we detect hard X-ray emission in the band equation keV in excess with respect to the thermal emission. The hard X-ray emission could be due to a population of energetic electrons accelerated by the magnetic field along the accretion streams. These particles could concur to pumping up the Fe fluorescence of cold Fe of the disk along with X-ray photons with equation keV.",19,[],1
1903.08466,astro-ph,"The sun occasionally undergoes the so-called grand minima, in which its magnetic activity, measured by the number of sunspots, is suppressed for decades. The most prominent grand minima, since the beginning of telescopic observations of sunspots, is the Maunder minimum (1645-1715), when the sunspots became rather scarce. The mechanism underlying the grand minima remains poorly understood as there is little observational information of the solar magnetic field at that time. In this study, we examine the records of one candidate aurora display in China and Japan during the Maunder minimum. The presence of auroras in such mid magnetic latitudes indicates the occurrence of great geomagnetic storms that are usually produced by strong solar flares. However, the records of contemporary sunspot observations from Europe suggest that, at least for the likely aurora event, there was no large sunspot that could produce a strong flare. Through simple theoretical arguments, we show that this geomagnetic storm could have been generated by an eruption giant quiescent filament, or a series of such events.",19,[],1

These results are evidence that some preferred structures universally contribute to the glass transition and show that analysis of interatomic geometry can find important structures not revealed by topology.",19,[],8
1909.08102,cond-mat,"Efforts to understand the microscopic origin of superconductivity in the cuprates are dependent on knowledge of the normal state. The Hall number in the low temperature, high field limit equation has a particular significance because within conventional transport theory it is simply related to the number of charge carriers, and so its evolution with doping gives crucial information about the nature of the charge transport. Here we report a study of the high field Hall coefficient of the single-layer cuprates TlequationBaequationCuOequation (Tl2201) and (Pb/La) doped BiequationSrequationCuOequation (Bi2201) which shows how equation evolves in the overdoped, so-called strange metal, regime of cuprates. We find that equation increases smoothly from equation to equation, where equation is the number of holes doped into the parent insulating state, over a wide range of doping. The evolution of equation correlates with the emergence of the anomalous linear-in-equation term in the low-equation in-plane resistivity. The results could suggest that quasiparticle decoherence extends to dopings well beyond the pseudogap regime.",19,[],8
1907.02537,cond-mat,"When two lasers are applied to a non-centrosymmetric material, light can be generated at the difference of the incoming frequencies equation, a phenomenon known as difference frequency generation (DFG), well characterized in semiconductors. In this work, we derive a general expression for DFG in metals, which we use to show that the DFG in chiral topological semimetals under circular polarized light is quantized in units of equation and independent of material parameters, including the scattering time equation, when equation. In this regime, DFG provides a simpler alternative to measure a quantized response in metals compared to previous proposals based on single frequency experiments. Our general derivation unmasks, in addition, a free-carrier contribution to the circular DFG beyond the semiclassical one. This contribution can be written as a Fermi surface integral, features strong frequency dependence, and oscillates with a equation shift with respect to the quantized contribution. We make predictions for the circular DFG of chiral and non-chiral materials using generic effective models, and ab-initio calculations for TaAs and RhSi. Our work provides a complete picture of the DFG in the length gauge approach, in the clean, non-interacting limit, and highlights a plausible experiment to measure topologically quantizated photocurrents in metals.",19,[],8
1905.00290,cond-mat,"We use density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory to demonstrate the emergence of a metallic layer at the interface between the two Mott insulators LaTiOequation and LaVOequation. The metallic layer is due to charge transfer across the interface, which alters the valence state of the transition metal cations close to the interface. Somewhat counter-intuitively, the charge is transferred from the Ti cations with formal equation electron configuration to the the V cations with formal equation configuration, thereby increasing the occupation difference of the equation states. This can be understood as a result of a gradual transition of the charge transfer energy, or electronegativity, across the interface. The spatial extension of the metallic layer, in particular towards the LaTiOequation side, can be controlled by epitaxial strain, with tensile strain leading to a localization within a thickness of only two unit cells. Our results open up a new route for creating a tunable quasi-two-dimensional electron gas in materials with strong electronic correlations.",19,[],8
1912.11331,cond-mat,"We study the spin-fluctuation-mediated equation-wave superconductivity in the bilayer Hubbard model with vertical and diagonal interlayer hoppings. As in the two-leg ladder model with diagonal hoppings, studied previously by the present authors, superconductivity is strongly enhanced when one of the bands lies just below (or touches) the Fermi level, that is, when the band is incipient. The strong enhancement of superconductivity is because large weight of the spin fluctuations lies in an appropriate energy range, whereas the low energy, pair-breaking spin fluctuations are suppressed. The optimized eigenvalue of the linearized Eliashberg equation, a measure for the strength of superconductivity, is not strongly affected by the bare width of the incipient band, but the parameter regime where superconductivity is optimized is wide when the incipient band is narrow, and in this sense, the coexistence of narrow and wide bands is favorable for superconductivity.",19,[],8

With decreasing temperature to 20 K, the spin-to-charge conversion efficiency is drastically enhanced to 3.9 nm, which is the largest positive value ever reported for LAO/STO. Our band-structure calculation well reproduces this behavior and predicts further enhancement by controlling the density and relaxation time of the carriers.",19,[],8
1910.08727,cond-mat,"As the surface Andreev bound state (ABS) forms at the open (equation) edge of a equation-wave superconductor, the local density of states (LDOS) increases. Therefore, a strong electron correlation and drastic phenomena may occur. However, a theoretical study on the effects of the ABS on the electron correlation has not been performed yet. To understand these effects, we study large cluster Hubbard model with an open (equation) edge in the presence of a bulk equation-wave gap. We calculate the site-dependent spin susceptibility by performing random-phase-approximation (RPA) and modified fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation in the real space. We find that near the (equation) edge, drastic ferromagnetic (FM) fluctuations occur owing to the ABS. In addition, as the temperature decreases, the system rapidly approaches a magnetic-order phase slightly below the transition temperature of the bulk equation-wave superconductivity (SC). In this case, the FM fluctuations are expected to induce interesting phenomena such as edge-induced triplet SC and quantum critical phenomena.",19,[],8

We show that such systems exhibit universal scaling in momentum and time of the quasiparticle distribution function, with the universal exponents distinct from those recently observed in Bose-Einstein condensates. This new universality class originates from the SU(2) symmetry of the Hamiltonian, which leads to a strong momentum-dependent magnon-magnon scattering amplitude. We compute the universal exponents using the Boltzmann kinetic equation and incoherent initial conditions that can be realized with microwave pumping of magnons. We compare our numerical results with analytic estimates of the scaling exponents and demonstrate the robustness of the scaling to variations in the initial conditions.

1901.08664,cond-mat,"Indirect excitons (IX) in semiconductor heterostructures are bosons, which can cool below the temperature of quantum degeneracy and can be effectively controlled by voltage and light. IX quantum Bose gases and IX devices were explored in GaAs heterostructures where an IX range of existence is limited to low temperatures due to low IX binding energies. IXs in van der Waals transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures are characterized by large binding energies giving the opportunity for exploring excitonic quantum gases and for creating excitonic devices at high temperatures. TMD heterostructures also offer a new platform for studying single-exciton phenomena and few-particle complexes. In this work, we present studies of IXs in MoSeequation/WSeequation heterostructures and report on two IX luminescence lines whose energy splitting and temperature dependence identify them as neutral and charged IXs.

In detail, the nuclear quadrupole interaction leads to pinning of the Overhauser field along the quadrupole axis, which is close to the growth axis of the heterostructure. The nuclear effects are observed only when resident electrons are confined in the quantum dots, i.e. for Xequation trion photoexcitation. The presence of Xequation and Xequation trion contributions to the photoluminescence together with the quadrupole interaction significantly affects the dynamics of optical orientation in Voigt magnetic field. In absence of dynamic nuclear spin polarization the time evolution of the photoluminescence polarization was fitted by a form which describes the electron spin relaxation in ""frozen"" nuclear field fluctuations.

This work aims to show that this basic idea of isomorph theory can be extended by examining the microstructural features of the system. Using the topological framework in conjunction with the entropy calculation algorithm, we demonstrate that Voronoi entropy, a measure of the topological diversity of single atoms, provides a scaling law for the transport properties of soft-sphere fluids, which is comparable to the frequently used excess entropy scaling. By examining the relationship between the Voronoi entropy and the solid-like fraction of simple fluids, we suggest that the Frenkel line, a rigid-nonrigid crossover line, be a topological isomorphic line where the scaling relation qualitatively changes.",19,[],8

Without e-doping (equation), the ferro-orbital order without magnetism in FeSe is reproduced by the VCs.The orbital order quickly disappears when the hole-pocket vanishes at equation. With increasing equation further, the spin fluctuations remain small, whereas orbital fluctuations gradually increase with equation due to the VCs.

For a range of values of the relative interaction strength in the Hamiltonian, a compensation point is observed. We considered the Ising mechanics and employed the Monte Carlo method to determine the compensation point and critical temperature of the system. However, the effects of impurity in such systems are still not well studied. With that in mind, we address the effects of random non-magnetic impurity in the trilayer system.

The obtained linear time-convolution and time-convolutionless GMEs define a subdynamics in the s-particle phase space and contains no inhomogeneous initial correlations terms as compared to the conventional GMEs. No approximation like ""molecular chaos"" or Bogoliubov's principle of weakening of initial correlations is needed. The initial correlations are ""hidden"" in the projection operator and thus they are accounted for in the obtained equations. For the weak interparticle interaction and weak external field, these equations are rewritten in the second order of the perturbation theory. Essentially, that they contain the contribution of initial correlations in the kernel governing the evolution of an s-particle distribution function.

We study both close packed as well as open crystals with multi atom bases. Atomic displacement fluctuations in a solid, once coarse-grained over some neighborhood may be decomposed into two mutually orthogonal components. In any dimension equation there are always equation \em affine displacements representing local strains and rotations of the ideal reference configuration. In addition, there exists a number of \em non-affine localized displacement modes that cannot be represented as strains or rotations. The number of these modes depends on equation and the size of the coarse graining region. All thermodynamic averages and correlation functions concerning the affine and non-affine displacements may be computed within a harmonic theory. We show that for compact crystals, such as the square and triangular in equation and the simple, body-centered and face-centered cubic crystals in equation, a single set of equationfold degenerate modes always dominate the non-affine sub-space and are separated from the rest by a large gap. These modes may be identified with specific precursor configurations that lead to lattice defects.

By examining various configurations of the superlattice structures we conclude that the inclusion of anti-reflection units on both sides of the superlattice increases the overall ON/OFF ratio by an order of magnitude which can further help in scaling down of the memory device. It is also observed that the device with such anti-reflection units exhibits 32equation lesser RESET voltage than the most common PCM superlattice configurations and 27equation in the presence of elastic dephasing.

To understand the intrinsic dissipation mechanisms that ultimately limit large equation-values in metallic glasses, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to model metallic glass resonators subjected to bending vibrations. We calculate the vibrational density of states, redistribution of energy from the fundamental mode of vibration, and equation versus the kinetic energy per atom equation of the excitation. In the linear and nonlinear response regimes where there are no atomic rearrangements, we find that equation (since we do not consider coupling to the environment). We identify a characteristic equation above which atomic rearrangements occur, and there is significant energy leakage from the fundamental mode to higher frequencies, causing finite equation. Thus, equation is a critical parameter determining resonator performance. We show that equation decreases as a power-law, equation with increasing system size equation, where equation.

Angularly dependent magnetoresistance measurements show that SmFeOequation/Ta bilayers exhibit a positive SMR, in contrast to the negative SMR expected in previously studied collinear AFMs. The SMR amplitude increases linearly with increasing external magnetic field at higher magnetic field, suggesting that field-induced canting of the AFM spins plays an important role. In contrast, around the coercive field, no detectable SMR signal is observed, indicating that SMR of AFM and canting magnetization components cancel out. Below 50~K, the SMR amplitude increases sizably by a factor of two as compared to room temperature, which likely correlates with the long-range ordering of the Sm ions.

1906.06467,cond-mat,"Correlated materials with open-shell d- and f-ions having degenerate band edge states show a rich variety of interesting properties ranging from metal-insulator transition to unconventional superconductivity. The textbook view for the electronic structure of these materials is that mean-field approaches are inappropriate, as the interelectronic interaction U is required to open a band gap between the occupied and unoccupied degenerate states while retaining symmetry. We show that the latter scenario often defining what Mott insulators are, is in fact not needed for the 3d binary oxides MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO. The mean-field band theory can indeed lift such degeneracies in the binaries when nontrivial unit cell representations (polymorphous networks) are allowed to break symmetries, in conjunction with a recently developed non-empirical exchange and correlation density-functional without an on-site interelectronic interaction U. We explain how density-functional theory (DFT) in the polymorphous representation achieves band gap opening in correlated materials through a separate mechanism to the Mott-Hubbard approach. We show the method predicts magnetic moments and gaps for the four binary monoxides in both the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases, offering an effective alternative to symmetry-conserving approaches for studying a range of functionalities in open d- and f-shell complex materials.",19,[],8
1905.01221,cond-mat,"One of the hallmarks of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in two-dimensional (2D) superconductors is the universal jump of the superfluid density, that can be indirectly probed via the non-linear exponent of the current-voltage equation characteristics. Here, we compare the experimental measurements of equation characteristics in two cases, namely NbN thin films and SrTiOequation-based interfaces. While the former display a paradigmatic example of BKT-like non-linear effects, the latter do not seem to justify a BKT analysis. Rather, the observed equation characteristics can be well reproduced theoretically by modelling the effect of mesoscopic inhomogeneity of the superconducting state. Our results offer an alternative perspective on the spontaneous fragmentation of the superconducting background in confined 2D systems.",19,[],8
1911.12741,cond-mat,"The universal form of the density of nonphononic, quasilocalized vibrational modes of frequency equation in structural glasses, equation, was predicted theoretically decades ago, but only recently revealed in numerical simulations. In particular, it has been recently established that, in generic computer glasses, equation increases from zero frequency as equation, independent of spatial dimension and of microscopic details. However, in [E. Lerner, and E. Bouchbinder, Phys. Rev. E 96, 020104(R) (2017)] it was shown that the preparation protocol employed to create glassy samples may affect the form of their resulting equation: glassy samples rapidly quenched from high temperature liquid states were shown to feature equation with equation, presumably limiting the degree of universality of the equation law. Here we show that exponents equation are only seen in small glassy samples quenched from high-temperatue liquid states --- whose sizes are comparable to or smaller than the size of the disordered core of soft quasilocalized vibrations --- while larger glassy samples made with the same protocol feature the universal equation law. Our results demonstrate that observations of equation in the nonphononic density of states stem from finite-size effects, and we thus conclude that the equation law should be featured by any sufficiently large glass quenched from a melt.",19,[],8

All three cations, i.e., Pr, Co and Fe were found to be trivalent in nature. XPS analysis also suggested the system to be insulating in nature. Moreover, Raman spectroscopy study indicated the random distribution of the B-site ions (Co/Fe) triggered by same charge states. In temperature-dependent Raman study, the relative heights of the two observed phonon modes exhibited anomalous behaviour near magnetic transition temperature TN~270 K, thus indicating towards interplay between spin and phonon in the system. Furthermore, clear anomalous softening was observed below TN which confirmed the existence of strong spin-phonon coupling occurring for at least two phonon modes of the system. The line width analysis of the phonon modes essentially ruled out the role of magnetostriction effect in the observed phonon anomaly. The investigation of the lattice parameter variation across TN (obtained from the temperature-dependent neutron diffraction measurements) further confirmed the existence of the spin-phonon coupling.",19,[],8
1910.00636,cond-mat,"The structural dynamics of a 1D mixed-metal cyanide, CuequationAgequationAuequationCN, with intriguing thermal properties is explored. All the current known related compounds with straight-chain structures, such as CuCN, AgCN, AuCN and MequationM'equationCN (M, M' = Cu, Ag, Au), exhibit 1D negative thermal expansion (NTE) along the chains and positive thermal expansion (PTE) perpendicular to them. CuequationAgequationAuequationCN exhibits similar PTE perpendicular to the chains, however PTE, rather than NTE, is also observed along the chains. In order to understand the origin of this unexpected behavior, inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements were carried out, underpinned by DFT calculations. Synchrotron-based PDF analysis and 13C SSNMR measurements were also performed to build an input structural model for the lattice dynamical study. The results indicate that transverse motions of the metal ions are responsible for the PTE perpendicular to the chains, as is the case for the related group 11 cyanides. However NTE along the chain due to the tension effect of these transverse motions is not observed. For this system, DFT-based phonon calculations predict small PTE along the chain due to low-energy chain-slipping modes induced by a bond-rotation effect on the weak metallophilic bonds. However the observed PTE is greater than that predicted with the straight-chain model. Small bends in the chain to accommodate truly co-planar metals provide an alternative explanation for thermal behavior. These would mitigate the tension effect induced by the transverse motions of the metals and, as temperature increases and the chains move further apart, a straightening could occur resulting in the observed PTE. This hypothesis is further supported by unusual evolution in the phonon spectra, which suggest small changes in local symmetry with temperature.",19,[],8

They are of strong interest from a fundamental viewpoint and for application, where they have potential to act as information carriers in future low-power computing technologies. Importantly, skyrmions have high physical stability because of topological protection. However, they have potential to deform according to their local energy environment. Here we demonstrate that, in regions of high exchange energy density, skyrmions may exhibit such extreme deformation that spontaneous merging with nearest neighbours or spawning new skyrmions is favoured to attain a lower energy state. Using transmission electron microscopy and a high-speed imaging detector, we observe dynamics involving distinct configurational states, in which transitions are accompanied by spontaneous creation or annihilation of skyrmions. These observations raise important questions regarding the limits of skyrmion stability and topological charge conservation, while also suggesting a means of control of skyrmion creation and annihilation.",19,[],8

1902.04874,cond-mat,"Ultracold atoms in periodical driven optical lattices enable us to investigate novel band structures and explore the topology of the bands. In this work, we investigate the impact of the ramping process of the driving signal and propose a simple but effective method to realize desired asymmetric population in momentum distribution by controlling the initial phase of the driving signal. A quasi-momentum oscillation along the shaking direction in the frame of reference co-moving with the lattice is formed, causing the formation of the mix of ground energy band and first excited band in laboratory frame, within the regime that the driving frequency is far less than the coupling frequency between ground band and higher energy bands. This method avoids the construction of intricate lattices or complex control sequence. With a triangular lattice, we experimentally investigate the influence of the initial phase, frequency, amplitude of the driving signal on the population difference, and observe good agreement with our theoretical model. This provides guidance on how to load a driving signal in driven optical lattice experiment and also potentially supplies a useful tool to form a qubit that can be used in quantum computation.",19,[],8

We show that a zigzag-shaped geometry eliminates these trajectories, allowing the robust creation of Majorana states with both the induced gap equation and the Majorana size equation improved by more than an order of magnitude for realistic parameters. In addition to the improved robustness of Majoranas, this new zigzag geometry is insensitive to the geometric details and the device tuning.",19,[],8

We rationalizqe this property by exploiting the chiral symmetry of the low energy electronic states in graphene.

1912.03545,cond-mat,"While two-terminal HfOX (x<2) memristor devices have been studied for ion transport and current evolution, there have been limited reports on the effect of the long-range thermal environment on their performance. In this work, amorphous-HfOX based memristor devices on two different substrates, thin SiO2(280 nm)/Si and glass, with different thermal conductivities in the range from 1.2 to 138 W/m-K were fabricated. Devices on glass substrates exhibit lower reset voltage, wider memory window and, in turn, a higher performance window. In addition, the devices on glass show better endurance than the devices on the SiO2/Si substrate. These devices also show non-volatile multi-level resistances at relatively low operating voltages which is critical for neuromorphic computing applications. A Multiphysics COMSOL computational model is presented that describes the transport of heat, ions and electrons in these structures. The combined experimental and COMSOL simulation results indicate that the long-range thermal environment can have a significant impact on the operation of HfOx-based memristors and that substrates with low thermal conductivity can enhance switching performance.",19,[],8
1910.06516,cond-mat,"In this paper we explore the transport properties of three-component Fermi gases confined to one spatial dimension, interacting via a three-body interaction, in the high temperature limit. At the classical level, the three-body interaction is scale invariant in one dimension. However, upon quantization, an anomaly appears which breaks the scale invariance. This is very similar to the physics of two-component fermions in two spatial dimensions, where the two-body interaction is also anomalous. Previous studies have already hinted that the physics of these two systems are intimately related. Here we expand upon those studies by examining the thermodynamic properties of this anomalous one dimensional system in the high temperature limit. We show there is an exact mapping between the traditional two-body anomalous interaction in two dimensions, to that of three-body interaction in one dimension. This result is valid in the high temperature limit, where the thermodynamics can be understood in terms of few-body correlations.",19,[],8
1903.01579,cond-mat,"Structural defects are ubiquitous in condensed matter, and not always a nuisance. For example, they underlie phenomena such as Anderson localization and hyperuniformity, and they are now being exploited to engineer novel materials. Here, we show experimentally that the density of structural defects in a 2D binary colloidal crystal can be engineered with a random potential. We generate the random potential using an optical speckle pattern, whose induced forces act strongly on one species of particles (strong particles) and weakly on the other (weak particles). Thus, the strong particles are more attracted to the randomly distributed local minima of the optical potential, leaving a trail of defects in the crystalline structure of the colloidal crystal. While, as expected, the crystalline ordering initially decreases with increasing fraction of strong particles, the crystalline order is surprisingly recovered for sufficiently large fractions. We confirm our experimental results with particle-based simulations, which permit us to elucidate how this non-monotonic behavior results from the competition between the particle-potential and particle-particle interactions.",19,[],8

When considering Heisenberg exchange interactions only, two degenerate Weyl magnon nodes with topological charges equation2 are observed at high-symmetry points. Each Weyl point splits into two as the symmetry of the system is further reduced by including into consideration the nearest-neighbor Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction, crucial for obtaining an accurate fit to the experimental spin-wave spectrum. The predicted topological properties are verified by surface state and Chern number analysis.

1911.06331,cond-mat,"Realistic Hamiltonians for quantum spin liquids often exhibit a large separation of energy scales between their elementary excitations. At low but experimentally relevant temperatures, some excitations are in a low-temperature regime where they are sparse and hop coherently across the lattice, while others are thermally excited and behave as a dense, stochastic ensemble. We study the interplay of these quasiparticles in the case where it is driven solely by their nontrivial mutual statistics rather than by direct interaction energy terms. Specifically, we consider toy models for equation quantum spin liquids, where the two species of excitation (dubbed spinons and visons) are mutual semions. Our results show an intriguing feedback mechanism, akin to the Nagaoka effect, whereby the spinons become localised on patches of expelled visons whose typical diameter increases as temperature is reduced. We comment on the direct consequences of this phenomenon on the average density of excitations, as well as on transport and thermodynamic properties of the system. In particular, the combination of localisation and fractionalisation of the spinons leads to hysteretic behaviour in the density of excitations when performing closed temperature cycles. We argue that these effects can be measured in experiments and provide new avenues for obtaining evidence of quantum spin liquid behaviour.",19,[],8
1909.10347,cond-mat,"Logarithmic finite-size scaling of the O(equation) universality class at the upper critical dimensionality (equation) has a fundamental role in statistical and condensed-matter physics and important applications in various experimental systems.

We establish an explicit scaling form for the free energy density, which simultaneously consists of a scaling term for the Gaussian fixed point and another term with multiplicative logarithmic corrections. In particular, we conjecture that the critical two-point correlation equation, with equation the linear size, exhibits a two-length behavior: following the behavior equation governed by Gaussian fixed point at shorter distance and entering a plateau at larger distance whose height decays as equation with equation a logarithmic correction exponent. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we provide complementary evidence for the predictions through the finite-size scaling of observables including the two-point correlation, the magnetic fluctuations at zero and non-zero Fourier modes, and the Binder cumulant. Our work sheds light on the formulation of logarithmic finite-size scaling and has practical applications in experimental systems.",19,[],8

Here, we study high-energy spin cluster excitations in the spin cluster Mott insulator CuequationOSeOequation by means of spontaneous Raman scattering. Multiple high-energy optical magnon modes are observed, of which the Raman-activity is shown to originate in the Elliot-Loudon scattering mechanism. Upon crossing the long-range ordering transition temperature the magnetic modes significantly broaden, corresponding to scattering from localized spin excitations within the spin clusters. Different optical phonon modes show a strong temperature dependence, evidencing a strong magnetoelectric coupling between optical phonons and the high-energy spin cluster excitations.

Our total energy calculations using density functional theory (DFT) indicate a transition from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic coupling for increasing interatomic distances, corresponding to a sign change of the nearest neighbor exchange interaction. This sign change cannot easily be understood from a standard superexchange mechanism. Furthermore, the exchange interaction strongly depends on the corresponding reference state. This ""non-Heisenberg"" behavior increases with increasing volume and is also confirmed through non-collinear DFT calculations. An orbital- and energy-resolved decomposition of the exchange coupling suggests that an increased partial occupancy of equation orbitals near the Fermi level is crucial both for the sign change and the non-Heisenberg behavior of the nearest neighbor interaction. Furthermore, even though both equation and equation contributions to the exchange interactions decay exponentially for large inter-atomic distances, the equation contribution remains surprisingly strong over relatively large distances along the crystal axes.",19,[],8
1908.04341,cond-mat,"We analyze, through molecular dynamics simulations, the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity (k) of chain-oriented amorphous polyethylene (PE). We find that at increasing levels of orientation, the temperature corresponding to a peak k progressively decreases. Un-oriented PE exhibits the peak k at 350 K, while aligned PE under an applied strain of 400% shows a maximum at 100 K. This transition of peak k to lower temperatures with increasing alignment is explained in terms of a crossover from disorder to anharmonicity dominated phonon transport in aligned polymers. Evidence for this crossover is achieved by manipulating the disorder in the polymer structure and studying the resulting change in temperature corresponding to peak k. Disorder is modified through a change in the dihedral parameters of the potential function, allowing a change in the relative fraction of trans and gauche transformations.

In contrast to a conventional, flavor-isotropic O(3) singlet-triplet models, spin-orbit entangled triplon interactions are flavor-and-bond selective and thus highly frustrated. In a honeycomb lattice, we find close analogies with the Kitaev spin model -- an infinite number of conserved quantities, no magnetic condensation, and spin correlations being strictly short-ranged. However, due to the bosonic nature of triplons, there are no emergent gapless excitations within the spin gap, and ground state is a strongly correlated paramagnet of dense triplon pairs with no long-range entanglement. Using exact diagonalization, we study the bosonic Kitaev model and its various extensions, which break exact symmetries of the model and allow magnetic condensation of triplons.

By combining time-resolved two-photon photoemission experiments with state-of-the-art numerical calculations, an ultrafast (equation 10\,fs) relaxation due to Hund excitations and related photo-induced in-gap states are identified. Remarkably, the weight of these in-gap states displays long-lived coherent THz oscillations up to 2\,ps at low temperature. The frequency of these oscillations corresponds to the strength of the antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction in NiO and their lifetime vanishes as the N\'eel temperature is approached.

The common expectation borne out in previous experiments is that as the temperature is lowered, vortex motion is suppressed, leading to a decreased resistance. A new generation of materials provides access to the previously inaccessible regime of clean-limit superconductivity in atomically thin superconducting layers. We show experimentally that for few-layer 2H-NbSeequation the resistance below the superconducting transition temperature may be non-monotonic, passing through a minimum and then increasing again as temperature is decreased further. The effects exists over a wide range of current and magnetic fields, but is most pronounced in monolayer devices at intermediate currents. Analytical and numerical calculations confirm that the findings can be understood in a two-fluid vortex model, in which a fraction of vortices flow in channels while the rest are pinned but thermally fluctuating in position.

We find that the order-by-disorder transition is robust, persisting to finite applied field. In the vicinity of the critical driving field strength, a time crystal emerges, in which the period of the limit cycles becomes an integer equation multiple of the driving period. Because equation increases with system size, the period of the time crystal can be engineered. This period multiplication cascade is reminiscent of that occuring in amorphous solids subject to oscillatory shear near the onset of plastic deformation, and of the period bifurcation cascade near the onset of chaos in nonlinear systems, suggesting it is part of a larger class of phenomena in transitions of dynamical systems.

However, it is less understood in highly nonequilibrium settings, where the time it takes to traverse the phase boundary becomes comparable to the timescale of dynamical fluctuations. Using transient optical spectroscopy and femtosecond electron diffraction, we studied a photo-induced transition of a model charge-density-wave (CDW) compound, LaTeequation. We observed that it takes the longest time to suppress the order parameter at the threshold photoexcitation density, where the CDW transiently vanishes.

1905.10984,cond-mat,"The honeycomb Kitaev spin model provides a quantum spin liquid in the ground state, where the spin excitations are fractionalized into itinerant and localized Majorana fermions; the former spectrum has a broad continuum ranging up to a high energy, while the latter has a sharp peak at a low energy. Despite tremendous efforts, it remains elusive to clearly identify these distinct Majorana excitations in experiments. Here we show their manifestation in the time evolution after quenching the magnetic field, by using the time-dependent Majorana mean-field theory for both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev models. We find that the transient spin dynamics from the quantum spin liquid states is qualitatively different from the conventional spin precessions by the quench from the high-field forced-ferromagnetic state. We obtain peculiar time evolutions with distinct time scales, i.e., short-time decay of high-energy components associated with the itinerant Majorana excitations, and long-lived excitations at a low energy by the localized ones. These peculiar behaviors are caused by the energy transfer between the two Majorana quasiparticles after the field quench. Moreover, we find that the Majorana semimetal with the point nodes in equilibrium turns into a Majorana metal with the transient ""Fermi surfaces"" by the energy transfer. In particular, for the quench from the intermediate-field quantum spin liquid in the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model, the Fermi surfaces change their topology in the time evolution, which is regarded as a dynamical version of the Majorana ""Lifshitz transition"".

With this view, we introduce the entanglement conductance (EC), which quantifies how much EH is long-range and propose it as an alternative quantity to measure entanglement in the Anderson phase transition, by which we locate the phase transition point of some one-dimensional free fermion models; and also by applying the finite size method to the EC, we find three-dimensional Anderson phase transition critical disorder strength.",19,[],8
1901.09536,cond-mat,"We propose a Chern insulator in a two-dimensional electron system with Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, ferromagnetism, and spin-dependent effective mass. The analytically-obtained topological phase diagrams show the topological phase transitions induced by tuning the magnetization orientation with the Chern number varying between equation. The magnetization orientation tuning shown here is a more practical way of triggering the topological phase transitions than manipulating the exchange coupling that is no longer tunable after the fabrication of the system. The analytic results are confirmed by the band structure and transport calculations, showing the feasibility of this theoretical proposal. With the advanced and mature semiconductor engineering today, this Chern insulator is very possible to be experimentally realized and also promising to topological spintronics.",19,[],8
1904.04670,cond-mat,"The single-layer FeSe films grown on SrTiO3 (STO) substrates have attracted much attention because of its record high superconducting critical temperature (Tc). It is usually believed that the composition of the epitaxially grown single-layer FeSe/STO films is stoichiometric, i.e., the ratio of Fe and Se is 1:1. Here we report the identification of a large amount of excess Fe in the superconducting single-layer FeSe/STO films. By depositing Se onto the superconducting single-layer FeSe/STO films, we find by in situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) the formation of the second-layer FeSe islands on the top of the first layer during the annealing process at a surprisingly low temperature (equation150\degC) which is much lower than the usual growth temperature (equation490\degC). This observation is used to detect excess Fe and estimate its quantity in the single-layer FeSe/STO films. The amount of excess Fe detected is at least 20% that is surprisingly high for the superconducting single-layer FeSe/STO films. The discovery of such a large amount of excess Fe should be taken into account in understanding the high-Tc superconductivity and points to a likely route to further enhance Tc in the superconducting single-layer FeSe/STO films.",19,[],8

Following the forward-simulation scheme, the interdiffusion coefficients in grains with diverse orientation are obtained and subsequently used to determine the anisotropic interdiffusion coefficients perpendicular (D\perp (x)) and parallel (D\parallel (x)) to the c axis of the hcp Mg lattice in a Mg-Al alloy as a function of the Al solute content at 673 K and 723 K, respectively. It was found that the interdiffusion coefficients generally increased with the Al content and the rotation angle with respect to the c axis with a valley point around letter approx 30 \deg at 723 K. And it was noticed that diffusion along the basal plane was always faster than along the c axis.

In particular, we use magnonic nanoantennas based on tailored spin-textures for launching spatially shaped coherent wavefronts, diffraction-limited spin-wave beams, and generating robust multi-beam interference patterns, which spatially extend for several times the spin-wave wavelength. Furthermore, we show that intriguing features, such as resilience to back-reflection, naturally arise from the spin-wave nonreciprocity in synthetic antiferromagnets, preserving the high quality of the interference patterns from spurious counterpropagating modes.

1903.06732,cond-mat,"The control of the local strain profile in 2D materials offers an invaluable tool for tailoring the electronic and photonic properties of solid-state devices. In this paper, we demonstrate a local engineering of the exciton photoluminescence (PL) energy of monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS2) by means of strain. We apply a local uniaxial stress to WS2 by exploiting electron-beam patterned and actuated polymeric micrometric artificial muscles (MAMs), which we implement onto monolithic synthetic WS2/graphene heterostructures. We show that MAMs are able to induce an in-plane stress to the top WS2 layer of the van der Waals heterostructure and that the latter can slide on the graphene underneath with negligible friction. As a proof of concept for the local strain-induced PL shift experiments, we exploit a two-MAM configuration in order to apply uniaxial tensile stress on well-defined micrometric regions of WS2. Remarkably, our architecture does not require the adoption of fragile suspended microstructures. We observe a spatial modulation of the excitonic PL energy of the WS2 monolayers under stress, which agrees with the expected strain profile and attains a maximum redshift of about 40 meV at the maximum strain intensity point. After the actuation, a time-dependent PL blueshift is observed in agreement with the viscoelastic properties of the polymeric MAMs. Our approach enables inducing local and arbitrary deformation profiles and circumvents some key limitations and technical challenges of alternative strain engineering methods requiring the 2D material transfer and production of suspended membranes.",19,[],8

By employing Green's function formalism via the equation of motion procedure, we calculate the physical quantities of interest. Our results show that the leakage of the MBS into the continuum state is achieved and can alter the physics of Coulomb blockade in the system through continuum-mediated coupling between MBS and QD.

Here, we investigate the electronic ground states of equation-SrequationCrOequation, a compound that is a rare embodiment of the spin-1 Kugel-Khomskii model on the square lattice -- a paradigmatic platform to capture the physics of coupled magnetic and orbital electronic orders. We have used resonant X-ray diffraction at the Cr-equation edge to reveal N\'eel magnetic order at the in-plane wavevector equation below equation K, as well as an additional electronic order at the 'stripe' wavevector equation below Tequation equation K. These findings are examined within the framework of the Kugel-Khomskii model by a combination of mean-field and Monte-Carlo approaches, which supports the stability of the spin N\'eel phase with subsequent lower-temperature stripe orbital ordering, revealing a candidate mechanism for the experimentally observed peak at equation. On the basis of these findings, we propose that equation-SrequationCrOequation serves as a new platform in which to investigate multi-orbital physics and its role in the low-temperature phases of Mott insulators.",19,[],8

Donor peaks are found both near the conduction band and deep in the sub-gap, with peak densities of equation cmequationeVequation. Two deep acceptor-like metal vacancy peaks with peak densities in the range of equation cmequationeVequation and lie adjacent to the valance band Urbach tail region at 2.0 to 2.5 eV below the conduction band edge. By applying detailed charge balance, we show increasing the density of metal vacancy deep-acceptors strongly shifts the equation-IGZO TFT threshold voltage to more positive values. Photoionization (hequation > 2.0 eV) of metal vacancy acceptors is one cause of transfer curve hysteresis in equation-IGZO TFTs owing to longer recombination lifetimes as they get captured into acceptor-like vacancies.",19,[],8

By comparison of systems comprised of Pt/Co90Fe10/Oxide and Cu/Co90Fe10/Oxide, we also show how oxidation of one interface can enhance and add to the total DMI of that generated by the Pt interface. This is due to the fact that the DMI on both interfaces promotes left-handed chirality. Finally, by use of ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we show that the DMI and the spectroscopic splitting factor, which is a measure of the orbital momentum, are correlated. This indicates the importance of hybridization and charge transfer at the oxide interface for the DMI.",19,[],8

The Curie temperature reported for those materials, however, has been so far remained relatively low. Here, we measure magneto-optical Kerr effects (MOKE) under perpendicular magnetic field for van der Waals ferromagnet Cr2Ge2Te6 as well as its heterostructure with antiferromagnetic insulator NiO. We observe a notable increase in both Curie temperature and magnetic perpendicular anisotropy in Cr2Ge2Te6/NiO heterostructures compared to those in Cr2Ge2Te6. Measurements on the same exfoliated Cr2Ge2Te6 flake (on a SiO2/Si substrate) before and after depositing NiO show that the hysteresis loop can change into a square shape with larger coercive field for Cr2Ge2Te6/NiO. The maximum Curie temperature (TC) observed for Cr2Ge2Te6/NiO reaches ~120 K, is nearly twice the maximum TC ~ 60 K reported for Cr2Ge2Te6 alone. Both enhanced perpendicular anisotropy and increased Curie temperature are observed for Cr2Ge2Te6 flakes with a variety of thicknesses ranging from ~5 nm to ~200 nm. The results indicate that magnetic properties of two-dimensional van der Waals magnets can be engineered and controlled by using the heterostructure interface with other materials.",19,[],8

Text-maps are colored with different intensities depending on the relevance of the words recognized over the image. Concretely, these words are previously extracted using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and they are colored according to the probability of belonging to a textual category of interest. In this sense, this solution is especially relevant in the context of item coding for supermarket products, where different types of textual categories must be identified, such as ingredients or nutritional facts.

Users can draw a spatial distribution of different concept labels, such as ""sky"", ""sea"" or ""person"" and then use these sketches to find images or video scenes that exhibit a similar distribution of these concepts.

1904.03031,cs,"Context: A substantial amount of work has been done to detect smells in source code using metrics-based and heuristics-based methods. Machine learning methods have been recently applied to detect source code smells; however, the current practices are considered far from mature. Objective: First, explore the feasibility of applying deep learning models to detect smells without extensive feature engineering, just by feeding the source code in tokenized form. Second, investigate the possibility of applying transfer-learning in the context of deep learning models for smell detection. Method: We use existing metric-based state-of-the-art methods for detecting three implementation smells and one design smell in C# code. Using these results as the annotated gold standard, we train smell detection models on three different deep learning architectures. These architectures use Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) of one or two dimensions, or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) as their principal hidden layers. For the first objective of our study, we perform training and evaluation on C# samples, whereas for the second objective, we train the models from C# code and evaluate the models over Java code samples. We perform the experiments with various combinations of hyper-parameters for each model. Results: We find it feasible to detect smells using deep learning methods. Our comparative experiments find that there is no clearly superior method between CNN-1D and CNN-2D. We also observe that performance of the deep learning models is smell-specific.

Here e.g. hand-sorting of medium value scrap is labor intensive and requires experienced and skilled workers. On the one hand, they have to be highly concentrated for making proper readings and analyses of the material, but on the other hand, this work is monotonous. Therefore, a machine learning approach is proposed for a quick and reliable automated identification of alloys in the recycling industry, while the mere scrap handling is regarded to be left in the hands of the workers. To this end, a set of twelve tool and high-speed steels from the field were selected to be identified by their spectrum induced by electric arcs. For data acquisition, the optical emission spectrometer Thorlabs CCS 100 was used. Spectra have been post-processed to be fed into the supervised machine learning algorithm. The development of the machine learning software is conducted according to the steps of the VDI 2221 standard method. For programming Python 3 as well as the python-library sklearn were used. By systematic parameter variation, the appropriate machine learning algorithm was selected and validated. Subsequent validation steps showed that the automated identification process using a machine learning approach and the optical emission spectrometry is applicable, reaching a maximum F1 score of 96.9 %.

1910.01012,cs,"Safety-critical systems must always have predictable and reliable behavior, otherwise systems fail and lives are put at risk. Even with the most rigorous testing it is impossible to test systems using all possible inputs.

Safety critical systems are normally designed to be fault tolerant so they do not fail when given unexpected inputs.   Anomaly detection has been proposed as a technique for improving the fault tolerance of safety-critical systems. Past work, however, has been largely limited to behavioral parameter thresholds that miss many kinds of system deviations. Here we propose a novel approach to anomaly detection in fault-tolerant safety critical systems using patterns of messages between threads.

1907.06995,cs,"While many multiagent algorithms are designed for homogeneous systems (i.e. all agents are identical), there are important applications which require an agent to coordinate its actions without knowing a priori how the other agents behave. One method to make this problem feasible is to assume that the other agents draw their latent policy (or type) from a specific set, and that a domain expert could provide a specification of this set, albeit only a partially correct one. Algorithms have been proposed by several researchers to compute posterior beliefs over such policy libraries, which can then be used to determine optimal actions. In this paper, we provide theoretical guidance on two central design parameters of this method: Firstly, it is important that the user choose a posterior which can learn the true distribution of latent types, as otherwise suboptimal actions may be chosen. We analyse convergence properties of two existing posterior formulations and propose a new posterior which can learn correlated distributions. Secondly, since the types are provided by an expert, they may be inaccurate in the sense that they do not predict the agents' observed actions.

In such cases, a model aware adversary can carefully design attack vectors to bypass bad data detection and identification filters while causing damage to the control system. To counter such an attacker, we propose the moving target defense which introduces stochastic, time-varying parameters in the control system. The underlying random dynamics of the system limit an attacker's model knowledge and inhibits his/her ability to construct stealthy attack sequences. Moreover, the time-varying nature of the dynamics thwarts adaptive adversaries. We explore three main designs. First, we consider a hybrid system where parameters within the existing plant are switched among multiple modes. We demonstrate how such an approach can enable both the detection and identification of malicious nodes. Next, we investigate the addition of an extended system with dynamics that are coupled to the original plant but do not affect system performance. An attack on the original system will affect the authenticating subsystem and in turn be revealed by a set of sensors measuring the extended plant. Lastly, we propose the use of sensor nonlinearities to enhance the effectiveness of the moving target defense. The nonlinear dynamics act to conceal normal operational behavior from an attacker who has tampered with the system state, further hindering an attacker's ability to glean information about the time-varying dynamics. In all cases mechanisms for analysis and design are proposed. Finally, we analyze attack detectability for each moving target defense by investigating expected lower bounds on the detection statistic. Our contributions are tested via simulation.",19,[],7
1905.07419,cs,"Deep-learning is a cutting edge theory that is being applied to many fields. For vision applications the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are demanding significant accuracy for classification tasks. Numerous hardware accelerators have populated during the last years to improve CPU or GPU based solutions. This technology is commonly prototyped and tested over FPGAs before being considered for ASIC fabrication for mass production. The use of commercial typical cameras (30fps) limits the capabilities of these systems for high speed applications. The use of dynamic vision sensors (DVS) that emulate the behavior of a biological retina is taking an incremental importance to improve this applications due to its nature, where the information is represented by a continuous stream of spikes and the frames to be processed by the CNN are constructed collecting a fixed number of these spikes (called events). The faster an object is, the more events are produced by DVS, so the higher is the equivalent frame rate. Therefore, these DVS utilization allows to compute a frame at the maximum speed a CNN accelerator can offer. In this paper we present a VHDL/HLS description of a pipelined design for FPGA able to collect events from an Address-Event-Representation (AER) DVS retina to obtain a normalized histogram to be used by a particular CNN accelerator, called NullHop. VHDL is used to describe the circuit, and HLS for computation blocks, which are used to perform the normalization of a frame needed for the CNN. Results outperform previous implementations of frames collection and normalization using ARM processors running at 800MHz on a Zynq7100 in both latency and power consumption.

1902.07986,cs,"In today's programmable blockchains, smart contracts are limited to being deterministic and non-probabilistic. This lack of randomness is a consequential limitation, given that a wide variety of real-world financial contracts, such as casino games and lotteries, depend entirely on randomness. As a result, several ad-hoc random number generation approaches have been developed to be used in smart contracts. These include ideas such as using an oracle or relying on the block hash. However, these approaches are manipulatable, i.e. their output can be tampered with by parties who might not be neutral, such as the owner of the oracle or the miners. We propose a novel game-theoretic approach for generating provably unmanipulatable pseudorandom numbers on the blockchain. Our approach allows smart contracts to access a trustworthy source of randomness that does not rely on potentially compromised miners or oracles, hence enabling the creation of a new generation of smart contracts that are not limited to being non-probabilistic and can be drawn from the much more general class of probabilistic programs.",19,[],7
1909.11620,cs,"We introduce a method to analyze and modify a shape to make it manufacturable for a given additive manufacturing (AM) process. Different AM technologies, process parameters or materials introduce geometric constraints on what is manufacturable or not. Given an input 3D model and minimum printable feature size dictated by the manufacturing process characteristics and parameters, our algorithm generates a corrected geometry that is printable with the intended AM process. A key issue in model correction for manufacturability is the identification of critical features that are affected by the printing process. To address this challenge, we propose a topology aware approach to construct the allowable space for a print head to traverse during the 3D printing process. Combined with our build orientation optimization algorithm, the amount of modifications performed on the shape is kept at minimum while providing an accurate approximation of the as-manufactured part.

The resulting entity-enhanced version of BERT (called E-BERT) is similar in spirit to ERNIE (Zhang et al., 2019) and KnowBert (Peters et al., 2019), but it requires no expensive further pretraining of the BERT encoder. We evaluate E-BERT on unsupervised question answering (QA), supervised relation classification (RC) and entity linking (EL). On all three tasks, E-BERT outperforms BERT and other baselines.

1903.02990,cs,"Current main memory database system architectures are still challenged by high contention workloads and this challenge will continue to grow as the number of cores in processors continues to increase. These systems schedule transactions randomly across cores to maximize concurrency and to produce a uniform load across cores. Scheduling never considers potential conflicts. Performance could be improved if scheduling balanced between concurrency to maximize throughput and scheduling transactions linearly to avoid conflicts. In this paper, we present the design of several intelligent transaction scheduling algorithms that consider both potential transaction conflicts and concurrency. To incorporate reasoning about transaction conflicts, we develop a supervised machine learning model that estimates the probability of conflict. This model is incorporated into several scheduling algorithms. In addition, we integrate an unsupervised machine learning algorithm into an intelligent scheduling algorithm. We then empirically measure the performance impact of different scheduling algorithms on OLTP and social networking workloads. Our results show that, with appropriate settings, intelligent scheduling can increase throughput by 54% and reduce abort rate by 80% on a 20-core machine, relative to random scheduling. In summary, the paper provides preliminary evidence that intelligent scheduling significantly improves DBMS performance.",19,[],7

In this paper, we propose a novel joint model of syntactic and semantic parsing on both span and dependency representations, which incorporates syntactic information effectively in the encoder of neural network and benefits from two representation formalisms in a uniform way. The experiments show that semantics and syntax can benefit each other by optimizing joint objectives.

A novel trainable extreme channel prior embedded layer (ECPeL) is developed to aggregate both extreme channel and blurry image representations, and sparse regularization is introduced to regularize the ECPeNet model learning. Furthermore, we present an effective multi-scale network architecture that works in both coarse-to-fine and fine-to-coarse manners for better exploiting information flow across scales.

1910.00713,cs,"In this paper, we extend the recently developed continuous visual odometry framework for RGB-D cameras to an adaptive framework via online hyperparameter learning. We focus on the case of isotropic kernels with a scalar as the length-scale. In practice and as expected, the length-scale has remarkable impacts on the performance of the original framework. Previously it was handled using a fixed set of conditions within the solver to reduce the length-scale as the algorithm reaches a local minimum. We automate this process by a greedy gradient descent step at each iteration to find the next-best length-scale. Furthermore, to handle failure cases in the gradient descent step where the gradient is not well-behaved, such as the absence of structure or texture in the scene, we use a search interval for the length-scale and guide it gradually toward the smaller values. This latter strategy reverts the adaptive framework to the original setup. The experimental evaluations using publicly available RGB-D benchmarks show the proposed adaptive continuous visual odometry outperforms the original framework and the current state-of-the-art.

In the news representation model we use a CNN network to learn hidden representations of news articles based on their titles. In the user representation model we learn the representations of users based on the representations of their clicked news articles. Since different words and different news articles may have different informativeness for representing news and users, we propose to apply both word- and news-level attention mechanism to help our model attend to important words and news articles.

We propose effective attention as a complementary tool for improving explanatory interpretations based on attention. Furthermore, we show that input tokens retain to a large degree their identity across the model.

Deep learning that primarily constitutes neural computing stream in AI has shown significant advances in probabilistically learning latent patterns using a multi-layered network of computational nodes (i.e., neurons/hidden units). Structured knowledge that underlies symbolic computing approaches and often supports reasoning, has also seen significant growth in recent years, in the form of broad-based (e.g., DBPedia, Yago) and domain, industry or application specific knowledge graphs. A common substrate with careful integration of the two will raise opportunities to develop neuro-symbolic learning approaches for AI, where conceptual and probabilistic representations are combined. As the incorporation of external knowledge will aid in supervising the learning of features for the model, deep infusion of representational knowledge from knowledge graphs within hidden layers will further enhance the learning process.

In response, we introduce a novel approach for spectral coarsening. We show that it is possible to significantly reduce the sampling density of an operator derived from a 3D shape without affecting the low-frequency eigenvectors. By marrying techniques developed within the algebraic multigrid and the functional maps literatures, we successfully coarsen a variety of isotropic and anisotropic operators while maintaining sparsity and positive semi-definiteness.

1907.08057,cs,"A super point is a host that interacts with a far larger number of counterparts in the network over a period of time. Super point detection plays an important role in network research and application. With the increase of network scale, distributed super point detection has become a hot research topic. Compared with single-node super point detection algorithm, the difficulty of super point detection in multi-node distributed environment is how to reduce communication overhead. Therefore, this paper proposes a three-stage communication distributed super point detection algorithm: Rough Estimator based Asynchronous Distributed super point detection algorithm (READ). READ uses a lightweight estimator, the Rough Estimator (RE), which is fast in computation and takes less memory to generate candidate super point. At the same time, the Linear Estimator (LE) is used to accurately estimate the cardinality of each candidate super point, so as to detect the super point correctly. In READ, each node scans IP address pairs asynchronously. When reaching the time window boundary, READ starts three-stage communication to detect the super point. In this paper, we proof that the accuracy of READ in distributed environment is no less than that in the single node environment. Four groups of 10 Gb/s and 40 Gb/s real-world high-speed network traffic are used to test READ.

Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the discovering confident samples from the unlabeled dataset, once coupled with the above master-teacher-student network evolution, can significantly improve the overall semi-supervised learning performance.

However, the success and competitiveness of future SAV services depend on their operational models, which are linked intrinsically to the service configuration and fleet specification. In addition, any change in operational models will result in a different demand. Using a comprehensive framework of SAV simulation in a multi-modal dynamic demand system with integrated SAV user taste variation, this study evaluates the performance of various SAV fleets and vehicle capacities serving travelers across the Rouen Normandie metropolitan area in France. Also, the impact of ridesharing and rebalancing strategies on service performance is investigated.Research results suggest that the performance of SAV is strongly correlated with the fleet size and the strategy of individual or shared rides. Further analysis indicates that for the pricing scheme proposed in this study (i.e., 20% lower for ridesharing scenario), the standard 4-seats car with shared ride remains the best option among all scenarios. The results also underline that enabling vehicle-rebalancing strategies may have an important effect on both user and service-related metrics.

SICOMP 2011) study the problem of distinguishing equation-sparse functions from those that are far from equation-sparse under Hamming distance, to the best of our knowledge no prior work has explicitly focused on the more general problem of distance estimation in the equation setting, which is particularly well-motivated for noisy Fourier spectra. Given the focus on efficiency, our main result is an algorithm that solves this problem with query complexity equation for constant accuracy and error parameters, which is only quadratically worse than applicable lower bounds.",19,[],7

1910.08773,cs,"We describe the implementation of and early results from a system that automatically composes picture-synched musical soundtracks for videos and movies. We use the phrase ""picture-synched"" to mean that the structure of the automatically composed music is determined by visual events in the input movie, i.e. the final music is synchronised to visual events and features such as cut transitions or within-shot key-frame events. Our system combines automated video analysis and computer-generated music-composition techniques to create unique soundtracks in response to the video input, and can be thought of as an initial step in creating a computerised replacement for a human composer writing music to fit the picture-locked edit of a movie. Working only from the video information in the movie, key features are extracted from the input video, using video analysis techniques, which are then fed into a machine-learning-based music generation tool, to compose a piece of music from scratch. The resulting soundtrack is tied to video features, such as scene transition markers and scene-level energy values, and is unique to the input video. Although the system we describe here is only a preliminary proof-of-concept, user evaluations of the output of the system have been positive.",19,[],7

By surfacing MTACs in this way, we are able for the first time to formally define the security requirements of physical-layer measures that protect ToA measurement systems against attacks. Our viewpoint also enables us to provide a unified presentation of existing MTACs (such as those proposed in distance-bounding protocols and in a secure distance measurement standard) and to propose basic principles for protecting ToA measurement systems against attacks that remain unaddressed by existing mechanisms. We also use our perspective to systematically explore the tradeoffs between security and performance that apply to all signal modulation techniques enabling ToA measurements.",19,[],7

To this end, we propose a relation-aware framework for future trajectory forecast. Our system aims to infer relational information from the interactions of road users with each other and with the environment. The first module involves visual encoding of spatio-temporal features, which captures human-human and human-space interactions over time. The following module explicitly constructs pair-wise relations from spatio-temporal interactions and identifies more descriptive relations that highly influence future motion of the target road user by considering its past trajectory. The resulting relational features are used to forecast future locations of the target, in the form of heatmaps with an additional guidance of spatial dependencies and consideration of the uncertainty.

Similar to previous consensus protocol verification efforts, we model the protocol as a state transition system and reason over reachable global states. However, in contrast to previous work, our model explicitly incorporates timing issues (e.g., timeouts and network delays) and adversarial actions, reflecting a more realistic environment faced by a public blockchain. Thus far, we have proved asynchronous safety of the protocol: two different blocks cannot be certified in the same round, even when the adversary has complete control of message delivery in the network.

We accomplish this by breaking instance segmentation into two parallel subtasks: (1) generating a set of prototype masks and (2) predicting per-instance mask coefficients. Then we produce instance masks by linearly combining the prototypes with the mask coefficients. We find that because this process doesn't depend on repooling, this approach produces very high-quality masks and exhibits temporal stability for free. Furthermore, we analyze the emergent behavior of our prototypes and show they learn to localize instances on their own in a translation variant manner, despite being fully-convolutional.

To achieve this, one computational approach for representing human relationships and attributes is to use an explicit knowledge graph, which allows for high-level reasoning. We introduce a novel end-to-end-trainable neural network that is capable of generating a Social Relationship Graph - a structured, unified representation of social relationships and attributes - from a given input image. Our Social Relationship Graph Generation Network (SRG-GN) is the first to use memory cells like Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to iteratively update the social relationship states in a graph using scene and attribute context.

Given a set system where each set has size at most equation and each element is contained in at most equation sets, the algorithm reports whether a given set is in some fixed set cover whose expected size is equation times the minimum fractional set cover value. Our algorithm requires equation queries. This result improves upon the application of the reduction of [Parnas and Ron, TCS'07] on the result of [Kuhn et al., SODA'06], which leads to a query complexity of equation.   To obtain this result, we design a parallel set cover algorithm that admits an efficient simulation in the LCA model by using a sparsification technique introduced in [Ghaffari and Uitto, SODA'19] for the maximal independent set problem. The parallel algorithm adds a random subset of the sets to the solution in a style similar to the PRAM algorithm of [Berger et al., FOCS'89].

Remarkably, those specific equation coherent intertwiners used to construct our solutions have natural interpretations of the equation-dimensional polytopes, commonly viewed as basic units of the discrete spatial geometry. Therefore, while the strong imposition of the quantum simplicity constraints leads to an over-constrained solution space, our weak solution space for the constraints may contain the correct semiclassical degrees of freedom for intrinsic geometry of the spatial hypersurfaces. Moreover, some concrete relations are established between our construction and other existing approaches in solving the simplicity constraints in all dimensional loop quantum gravity, providing valuable insights into this unresolved important issue.",19,[],13

The -- yet uncalculated -- terms at 4PN order and beyond entering both the energy flux and the energy are taken into account as free parameters and then set to zero. We compare the quasi-5.5PN and 3.5PN approximants against full EOB waveforms using gauge-invariant phasing diagnostics equation, where equation is the dimensionless gravitational-wave frequency. The quasi-5.5PN phasing is found to be systematically closer to the EOB one than the 3.5PN one.

We explore the performance of the quasi-5.5PN approximant on the measurement of the tidal polarizability parameter equation using injections of EOB waveforms hybridized with numerical relativity merger waveforms. We prove that the quasi-5.5PN point-mass approximant augmented with 6PN-accurate tidal terms allows one to reduce (and in many cases even eliminate) the biases in the measurement of equation that are instead found when the standard 3.5PN point-mass baseline is used.

1902.01277,gr-qc,"We study the axial quasi-normal modes of neutron stars in scalar-tensor theories with massive scalar field including a self-interacting term in the potential. Various realistic equations of state including nuclear, hyperonic and hybrid matter are employed. Although the effect of spontaneous scalarization of neutron stars can be very large, binary pulsar observations and gravitational wave detections significantly constrain the massless scalar-tensor theories. If we consider a properly chosen nonzero mass for the scalar field, though, the scalar-tensor parameters cannot be restricted by the observations, resulting in large deviation from pure general relativity. With this motivation in mind, we extend the universal relations for axial quasi-normal modes known in general relativity to neutron stars in massive scalar-tensor theories with self-interaction using a wide range of realistic EOS. We confirm the universality of the scaled frequency and damping time in terms of the compactness and scaled moment of inertia for neutron stars with and without massive scalarization.",19,[],13
1905.03118,gr-qc,"Extracting the properties of a binary system emitting gravitational waves relies on models describing the last stages of the compact binary coalescence. In this article, we study potential biases inherent to current tidal waveform approximants for spinning and precessing systems. We perform a Bayesian study to estimate intrinsic parameters of highly spinning binary neutron star systems. Our analysis shows that one has to include the quadrupolar deformation of the neutron stars due to their rotation once dimensionless spins above equation are reached, otherwise the extracted intrinsic parameters are systematically biased. We find that at design sensitivity of Advanced LIGO and Virgo, it seems unlikely that for GW170817-like sources a clear imprint of precession will be visible in the analysis of the signal employing current waveform models. However, precession effects might be detectable for unequal mass configurations with spins larger than equation. We finalize our study by investigating possible benefits of a combined gravitational wave and electromagnetic detection. The presence of electromagnetic counterparts help in reducing the dimensionality of the parameter space with constraints on the sky location, source distance, and inclination. However, we note that although a small improvement in the estimation of the tidal deformability parameter is seen in these cases, changes in the intrinsic parameters are overall very small.",19,[],13
1909.10882,gr-qc,"We present a physically plausible solution representing Einstein's cluster mimicking the behaviors of compact star in the context of teleparallel equivalent of general relativity. The Teleparallel gravity (TEGR) is an alternative formulation of gravity which uses tetrads as the dynamical variables. We focus on two particularly interesting scenarios. First, we develop the Einstein clusters in TEGR field equations using effective energy-momentum tensor for diagonal as well as off-diagonal tetrad. We then study the clusters in modified equationgravity for anisotropic fluid distribution. Based on these two theories, we further study the solution without net electric charge and then for charged solution. For charge parameter equation, the charged solution reduces to neutral one. Our calculations show that when charge increases, the stiffness of the EoS also increases. This is due to increase in adiabatic index and sound speed approaching speed of light. When the charge increase beyond a certain limit (equation and equation), the compactness parameter crosses the Buchdahl limit i.e. equation and the solution start violating the causality condition. We test the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit for such compact objects. We analyze the static stability criterion of the Einstein clusters for both charged and uncharged case, and the stability of such compact objects is enhanced by the presence some net electric charge. Finally, we compare our solution for pure general relativity. As a result, we concluded that the Einstein cluster solution do exist in pure GR, however, physically unfit to mimic compact stars. We have also extend our findings by assuming the diagonal or off-diagonal tetrad and specific case of equation. In such models, Einstein's cluster solutions do exist however can't mimic the properties of a compact star.",19,[],13

Second, by using a correspondence between the motion of light rays in a cold non magnetized plasma and relativistic test massive particles we show that this technique is not only powerful to obtain the leading order behavior of the deflection angle of massive/massless particles in the weak field regime but also to obtain higher order corrections. We particularize it to a Kerr background where we compute the deflection angle for test massive particles and light rays propagating in a non homogeneous cold plasma by including third order corrections in the mass and spin parameters of the black hole.",19,[],13

In all cases the number of independent field equations is less than the number of independent functions, resulting in an undetermined function which can be freely specified.

Following up, we find that in spacetimes that are asymptotically flat, and admit spatial slices with vanishing linear momentum that are sufficiently close to conformal flatness, any boosted slice can not be conformally flat.

1905.09260,gr-qc,"In this paper, we investigate the morphology of the events from the GWTC-1 catalog of compact binary coalescences as reconstructed by a method based on coherent excess power: we use an open-source version of the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) analysis pipeline, which does not make use of waveform models. The coherent response of the LIGO-Virgo network of detectors is estimated by using loose bounds on the duration and bandwidth of the signal. This pipeline version reproduces the same results that are reported for cWB in recent publications by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations. In particular, the sky localization and waveform reconstruction are in a good agreement with those produced by methods which exploit the detailed theoretical knowledge of the expected waveform for compact binary coalescences. However, in some cases cWB also detects features in excess in well-localized regions of the time-frequency plane. Here we focus on such deviations and present the methods devised to assess their significance. Out of the eleven events reported in the GWTC-1, in two cases -- GW151012 and GW151226 -- cWB detects an excess of coherent energy after the merger (equation s and equation s, respectively) with p-values that call for further investigations (equation and equation, respectively), though they are not sufficient to exclude noise fluctuations.

1909.03034,gr-qc,"We show that in theories with nonminimal curvature-matter couplings up to first order in the curvature, baryon number (B) conservation and CP are automatically violated, provided that the curvature scalar and its gradient do not vanish. Together with the associated gravitationally induced particle creation in a cosmological framework, which is an essentially out-of-equilibrium process, this implies that all of Sakharov's conditions are satisfied in the simplest extension of General Relativity, without the need of CPT violation. Here, derivatives of the curvature can be disregarded, thus evading the potential problems associated with the Gravitational Baryogenesis (GB) model in a cosmological context. Thanks to the particle creation pressure and the trace anomaly, the curvature scalar is nonzero even in a radiation-dominated Universe. Moreover, the trace anomaly or the energy density of a massive scalar field can amplify the baryon asymmetry at very high temperatures, even when the particle creation rate is very slow. As a result, a baryon asymmetry compatible with observations and a huge CP violation can be generated in the early Universe.",19,[],13

The evidence of quasi-resonances is supported by calculations in the frequency and time domains, which are in a good concordance.

We find that domain wall can always cross horizon, for which the dilaton coupling constant equation and the ratio of pressure to density equation play the role of controlling parameters. Then the consequent domain wall motion outside the black hole generally falls into four situations: all time accelerating expansion, slow expansion with a constant speed, expansion followed by collapsing into horizon, and accelerating collapsing into horizon. However, there exists a small patch of parametric sphere, in which the domain wall expansion first slows down and then accelerates. Our analysis also reveals that the big bang theory applies to the domain wall world scenario, while big bounce will not appear in our paper. Furthermore, we find that when we choose the expansion stage as radiation or matter stage, the resultant coupling strength between dilaton field and Maxwell field depends on the different black hole models.",19,[],13

The introduction of the coupling translates into an energy exchange between the fluids. We find the interesting possibility of the emergence of a new fixed point, which is a scaling solution and an attractor of the system. In this case, it is possible to describe an everlasting Universe with equation, therefore alleviating the cosmic coincidence problem.

1905.13498,gr-qc,"An important probe of quantum geometry is its spectral dimension, defined via a spatial diffusion process. In this work we study the spectral dimension of a 'spatial hypersurface' in a manifoldlike causal set using the induced spatial distance function. In previous work, the diffusion was taken on the full causal set, where the nearest neighbours are unbounded in number. The resulting super-diffusion leads to an increase in the spectral dimension at short diffusion times, in contrast to other approaches to quantum gravity. In the current work, by using a temporal localisation in the causal set, the number of nearest spatial neighbours is rendered finite. Using numerical simulations of causal sets obtained from equation Minkowski spacetime, we find that for a flat spatial hypersurface, the spectral dimension agrees with the Hausdorff dimension at intermediate scales, but shows clear indications of dimensional reduction at small scales, i.e., in the ultraviolet. The latter is a direct consequence of 'discrete asymptotic silence' at small scales in causal sets.",19,[],13

We found an exact black hole solution with a Barriola-Vilenkin monopole at the origin. This object turns out to be the end point of the black hole evaporation. Interestingly for smaller masses, we found a ""naked monopole"" rather than a generic naked singularity. We also show that the Carr-Lake-Casadio-Scardigli proposal leads to mild modifications of spacetime metrics with respect to the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini solution.

1905.08484,gr-qc,"We follow the life of a generic primordial perturbation mode (scalar or tensor) subject to modified dispersion relations (MDR), as its proper wavelength is stretched by expansion.

We find that scalar modes in the observable range satisfy this condition, thus ensuring the viability of MDR models in this respect. For tensor modes we find a regime in which this does not occur, but in practice it can only be realised for wavelengths in the range probed by future gravity wave experiments if the quantum gravity scale experienced by gravity waves goes down to the PeV range.

A cosmologically produced background would carry unique signatures from the earliest epochs in the evolution of the Universe. Similarly, an astrophysical background would provide information about the astrophysical sources that generated it.

However the perturbation of Kerr-Newman black holes by neutrino fields leads to a generic overspinning of the black hole due to the absence of a lower limit for the frequency of the incident wave to ensure that it is absorbed by the black hole. For this case, the destruction of the event horizon cannot be fixed by any form of backreaction effects.

The apparently complicated dynamics can in most cases be described as simple precession of the orbital angular momentum about an approximately fixed total angular momentum. However, the imprint of the precession on the observed gravitational-wave signal is yet more complicated, with a non-trivial time-varying dependence on black-hole dynamics, the binary's orientation and the detector polarization. As a result, it is difficult to predict under which conditions precession effects are measurable in gravitational-wave observations, and their impact on both signal detection and source characterization. We show that the observed waveform can be simplified by decomposing it as a power series in a new precession parameter equation, where equation is the opening angle between the orbital and total angular momenta. The power series is made up of five harmonics, with frequencies that differ by the binary's precession frequency, and individually do not exhibit amplitude and phase modulations. In many cases, the waveform can be well approximated by the two leading harmonics. In this approximation we are able to obtain a simple picture of precession as caused by the beating of two waveforms of similar frequency.

However, we show that equations of motion can always be reduced to a second-order-in-time form as long as the original Einstein frame formulation is well posed. The inverse transformation from the Jordan frame back to the Einstein frame is not possible for all field values in all theories, but we obtain a fully invertible transformation for vector-tensor theories by a redefinition of the vector field. Our main motivation is a better understanding of spontaneous scalarization and its generalizations, however our conclusions are applicable to a wide class of theories. Jordan frame has been traditionally used for certain calculations in scalar-tensor theories of gravitation, and our results will help researchers generalize these results, enabling comparison to observational data.",19,[],13

1903.09862,gr-qc,"The well-known problem of wormholes in general relativity (GR) is the necessity of exotic matter, violating the Weak Energy Condition (WEC), for their support. This problem looks easier if, instead of island-like configurations, one considers string-like ones, among them, cylindrically symmetric space-times with rotation. However, for cylindrical wormhole solutions a problem is the lacking asymptotic flatness, making it impossible to observe their entrances as local objects in our Universe. It was suggested to solve this problem by joining a wormhole solution to flat asymptotic regions at some surfaces equation and equation on different sides of the throat. The configuration then consists of three regions, the internal one containing a throat and two flat external ones. We discuss different kinds of source matter suitable for describing the internal regions of such models (scalar fields, isotropic and anisotropic fluids) and present two examples where the internal matter itself and the surface matter on both junction surfaces equation respect the WEC. In one of these models the internal source is a stiff perfect fluid whose pressure is equal to its energy density, in the other it is a special kind of anisotropic fluid. Both models are free from closed timelike curves. We thus obtain examples of regular twice asymptotically flat wormhole models in GR without exotic matter and without causality violations.",19,[],13

In order to ensure spherical symmetry of the configurations, we use two spin-equation fields having opposite spins. By means of numerical computations, we find families of equilibrium configurations with a positive Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass described by regular zero-node asymptotically flat solutions for static Maxwell and Proca fields and for stationary spinor fields. For the case of the Maxwell field, it is shown that, with increasing charge equation, the masses of the objects increase and diverge as the charge tends to a critical value. For negative values of the coupling constant equation, we demonstrate that, by choosing physically reasonable values of this constant, it is possible to obtain configurations with masses comparable to the Chandrasekhar mass and with effective radii of the order of kilometers. It enables us to speak of an astrophysical interpretation of such systems, regarding them as charged Dirac stars. In turn, for the system with the Proca field, it is shown that the mass of the configurations also grows with increasing both equation and the coupling constant equation. Although in this case the numerical calculations do not allow us to make a definite conclusion about the possibility of obtaining masses comparable to the Chandrasekhar mass for physically reasonable values of equation, one may expect that such masses can be obtained for certain values of free parameters of the system under consideration.",19,[],13

More specifically,we apply the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to the generalized Jacobi metric space and then obtain an expression for calculating the deflection angle, which is related to Gaussian curvature of generalized optical metric and geodesic curvature of particles orbit. In particular, the finite-distance correction to the deflection angle of signal with general velocity in the the Kerr black hole and Teo wormhole spacetimes are considered. Our results cover the previous work of the deflection angle of light, as well as the deflection angle of massive particles in the limit for the receive and source at infinite distance from the lens object. In Kerr black hole spacetime, we compared the effects due to the black hole spin, the finite-distance of source or receiver, and the relativistic velocity in microlensings and lensing by galaxies.

1910.03887,hep-ex,"The current laws of physics do not explain the observed imbalance of matter and antimatter in the universe. Sakharov proposed that an explanation would require the violation of CP symmetry between matter and antimatter. The only CP violation observed so far is in the weak interactions of quarks, and it is too small to explain the matter-antimatter imbalance of the universe. It has been shown that CP violation in the lepton sector could generate the matter-antimatter disparity through the process called leptogenesis. The quantum mixing of neutrinos, the neutral leptons in the Standard Model, provides a potential source of CP violation through a complex phase dCP, which may have consequences for theoretical models of leptogenesis. This CP violation can be measured in muon neutrino to electron neutrino oscillations and the corresponding antineutrino oscillations, which are experimentally accessible with accelerator-produced beams as established by the T2K experiment. Until now, the value of dCP has not been significantly constrained by neutrino oscillation experiments. Here the T2K collaboration reports a measurement that favors large enhancement of the neutrino oscillation probability, excluding values of dCP which result in a large enhancement of the observed anti-neutrino oscillation probability at three standard deviations (3 sigma). The 3 sigma confidence level interval for dCP, which is cyclic and repeats every 2pi, is [-3.41,-0.03] for the so-called normal mass ordering, and [-2.54,-0.32] for the inverted mass ordering.

1905.02421,hep-ex,A search for the equation baryon through the equation decay is performed with a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.7 equation recorded by the LHCb experiment in equation collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No significant signal is observed in the mass range from the kinematic threshold of the decay to 3800 equation.

We show how the model can accommodate the strong hierarchies manifest in the charged fermion Yukawa matrices, while predicting a qualitatively different form for the light neutrino mass matrix that is consistent with observed neutrino mass squared differences and mixing angles.",19,[],2
1902.00893,hep-ph,"Indirect searches have the potential to probe scales beyond the realm of direct searches. In this letter we consider the implications of two parity violating experiments: weak charge of proton equation and the Caesium atom equation on the solutions to lepton flavour non-universality violations (LFUV) in the decay of equation mesons. Working in a generic implementation of a minimal equation model, we assume the primary contribution being due to the electron to facilitate comparison with the low equation parity violating experiments. We demonstrate that the conclusion is characterized by different limiting behavior depending on the chirality of the lepton current. The correlation developed in this study demonstrates the effectiveness in studying the synergy between different experiments leading to a deeper understanding of the interpretation of the existing data. It is shown that a possible future improvement in the parity violating experiments can have far reaching implications in the context of direct searches. We also comment on the prospect of addition of the muon to the fits and the role it plays in ameliorating the constraints on models of equation. This offers a complimentary understanding of the pattern of the coupling of the NP to the leptons, strongly suggesting either a muon only or a combination of solutions to the anomalies.",19,[],2
1902.11254,hep-ph,"In this work we propose a renormalizable model based on the equation gauge group where neutrino mass originates at the two-loop level without extending the fermionic content of the Standard Model (SM). Unlike the conventional equation models, in this proposed scenario, neutrino mass is intertwined with the charged fermion masses. In addition to correctly reproducing the SM charged fermion masses and mixings, neutrino mass is generated at the quantum level, hence naturally explains the smallness of neutrino masses. In this set-up, we provide examples of gauge coupling unification that simultaneously satisfy the proton decay constraints. This model has the potential to be tested experimentally by measuring the proton decay in the future experiments.

The recent result from the ACME experiment using ThO molecules is used to derive an impressive lower bound on the effective scale for equation at 8 TeV, assuming a QCD one-loop factor and no helicity suppression from new physics. One interesting aspect is that equation contributes to the observable EDM in ThO experiment mainly through CP-odd electron-nucleon interaction rather than direct electron EDM which arises from three-loop running and matching. For equation the current bound is much weaker and suffers from large uncertainties. We also discuss the QCD running and matching for the CP-odd electron-gluonic operators and give an estimate of the relevant nucleon matrix elements and uncertainties that are needed in the calculation.",19,[],2

An analytical formula for the density rate of yielded particles is established which is shown to manifest a nonperturbative dependence on both the strong and weak electric fields and to interpolate between the tunneling and multi-photon regimes. It is shown that--under appropriate circumstances--the produced plasma of electrons and positrons might reach densities for which their recombinations into high-energy photons occurs copiously.

An inert doublet and a complex singlet scalar complete the dark sector which is protected by an Abelian fermiophobic gauge symmetry that also forbids tree level mass contributions for the full set of light neutrinos. A fermion vector-like extension of the model is also proposed where the light right-handed neutrinos can thermalize in the primordial plasma and the extra gauge boson can be directly produced at colliders. In particular, the current upper bound on equation reported by PLANCK points to large ratios equation which can be competitive with collider constraint for equation sufficiently large in the ballpark of the Standard Model values, while future cosmic microwave background experiments may probe all the no minimal models presented here.",19,[],2

The most prominent collider signature of the considered setup is equation, providing continued motivation to search for same-sign tops at the LHC as well as a simple framework to interpret these searches.

1908.00521,hep-ph,"We present new results on the calculation of the dark matter relic abundance within the Higgs induced right-handed (RH) neutrino mixing model, solving the associated density matrix equation. For a benchmark value of the dark matter mass equation, we show the evolution of the abundance and how this depends on reheat temperature, dark matter lifetime and source RH neutrino mass equation, with the assumption equation. We compare the results with those obtained within the Landau-Zener approximation, showing that the latter largely overestimates the final abundance giving some analytical insight. However, we also notice that since in the density matrix formalism the production is non-resonant, this allows source RH neutrino masses below the W boson mass, making dark matter more stable at large mass values. This opens an allowed region for initial vanishing source RH neutrino abundance. For example, for equation, we find equation. Otherwise, for equation, one has to assume a thermalisation of the source RH neutrinos prior to the freeze-in of the dark matter abundance. This results into a large allowed range for equation, depending on equation. For example, imposing equation, allowing also successful leptogenesis, we find equation. We also discuss in detail leptogenesis with two quasi-degenerate RH neutrinos, showing a case when observed dark matter abundance and matter-antimatter asymmetry are simultaneously reproduced. Finally, we comment on how an initial thermal source RH neutrino abundance can be justified and on how our results suggest that also the interesting case where equation, embeddable in usual high scale two RH neutrino seesaw models, might be viable.",19,[],2

Besides, we construct the weak decays Hamiltonian of equation in hadronic level under the SU(3) flavor symmetry. The discussion of the Hamiltonian can deduce the decay amplitudes and width relations of the tetraquarks. Following the choosing rules, we collect some golden channels for the mesonic decays of tetraquarks, which will be helpful to search for triply heavy tetraquarks equation in future experiments.",19,[],2
1907.06693,hep-ph,"Right-handed neutrinos in supersymmetric models can act as the source of lepton flavor violation (LFV). We present experimental implications of lepton flavor-violating processes within a supersymmetric type-I seesaw framework in the three-extra-parameter non-universal Higgs model (NUHM3) for large (PMNS-like) and small (CKM-like) Yukawa mixing scenarios. We highlight LFV predictions for the natural (low equation) portion of parameter space. Our numerical analysis includes full 2-loop renormalization group running effects for the three neutrino masses and mass matrices. We show the projected discovery reach of various LFV experiments (equation Mu2e, Mu3e, MEG-II, Belle-II), and specify regions that have already been excluded by the LHC searches. Our results depend strongly on whether one has a normal sneutrino hierarchy (NSH) or an inverted sneutrino hierarchy (ISH). Natural SUSY with a NSH is already excluded by MEG-2013 results while large portions of ISH have been or will soon be tested. However, LFV processes from natural SUSY with small Yukawa mixing and an ISH seem below any projected sensitivities.

1905.08710,hep-ph,The analytic structure of the quark propagator in Minkowski space is more complex than in Euclidean space due to the possible existence of poles and branch cuts at timelike momenta. These singularities impose enormous complications on the numerical treatment of the nonperturbative Dyson-Schwinger equation for the quark propagator. Here we discuss a computational method that avoids most of these complications. The method makes use of the spectral representation of the propagator and of its inverse. The use of spectral functions allows one to handle in exact manner poles and branch cuts in momentum integrals. We obtain model-independent integral equations for the spectral functions and perform their renormalization by employing a momentum-subtraction scheme. We discuss an algorithm for solving numerically the integral equations and present explicit calculations in a schematic model for the quark-gluon scattering kernel.,19,[],2

In this paper, we discuss a novel framework which explains why the SM matter fields form the apparently complete equation multiplets. In the new framework, the apparent matter unification inevitably results from chiral equation gauge theory even if the quarks and leptons are not embedded into the common equation multiplets. We call this class of models the ""fake GUT"". The novel phenomenological prediction of the fake GUT is more variety of the nucleon decay modes than the conventional GUT, which reflects the rich structure of the origin of the matter fields.",19,[],2

These include a variety of nucleon and dinucleon decays to dilepton and trilepton final states with equation, and equation.

1903.10506,hep-ph,"We explore the concept of effective alignments: contractions of multiple flavour symmetry breaking flavon fields. These contractions give rise to directions that are hard or impossible to obtain directly by breaking the flavour symmetry. Within this context, and using equation as the flavour symmetry to exemplify, we perform a phenomenological check of lepton flavour models built from pairing any two effective alignments up to order 2 (in flavon contractions). The check is performed for each pair of effective alignments in a framework with models of constrained sequential dominance type, in a basis where the charged leptons are diagonal. We thus obtain an indication of which effective alignments are interesting for model building, within this so-called equation landscape. We find three types of viable topologies and provide examples of models realizing this strategy for each topology.",19,[],2
1903.10086,hep-ph,"We investigate the implications of the latest LHCb measurement of equation for NP explanations of the equation anomalies. The previous data could be explained if the equation NP is in (I) equation or (II) equation, with scenario (I) providing a better explanation than scenario (II). This continues to hold with the new measurement of equation. However, for both scenarios, this measurement leads to a slight tension of equation between separate fits to the equation and equation data. In this paper, we investigate whether this tension can be alleviated with the addition of NP in equation. In particular, we examine the effect of adding such NP to scenarios (I) and (II). We find several scenarios in which this leads to improvements in the fits. equation and LQ models with contributions to both equation and equation can reproduce the data, but only within scenarios based on (II).

A weak intermittent type of emission could be realized for minimum-bias (MB) equation events in equation space and a much stronger intermittency could be observed in high-multiplicity (HM) equation events in all equation, equation, and equation spaces at all the studied energies. For HM equation events, at a particular energy, the intermittency index equation is found to be largest in two-dimensional equation space and least in equation space, and no center of mass energy dependence of equation could be observed. The anomalous dimensions equation are observed to be increased with the order of the moment equation, suggesting a multifractal nature of the emission spectra of various studied events. While, the coefficient equation is found to decrease monotonically with the order of the moment equation for two-dimensional analysis of MB equation events as well as for one-dimensional analysis of HM equation events, a clear minimum in equation values could be observed from the two-dimensional HM equation data analysis. For PYTHIA Monash generated sets of data, the strength of the intermittency is found to vary significantly with the variation of the strength of the color reconnection (CR) parameter, i.e., reconnection range RR, for RR = 0.0, 1.8 and 3.0, thereby, establishing a strong connection between the CR mechanism and the observed intermittent type of emission of primary charged particles of the studied high-multiplicity equation events.",19,[],2

We derive the BFKL limit as a kinematic limit and argue that beyond the Wandzura-Wilczek approximation, 3-body and 4-body unintegrated PDFs should be taken into account even in this regime. Finally, we analyze how saturation should be understood as three distinct effects: saturation through non-linearities in the evolution equations at small equation, saturation through multiple interactions with slow gluons as TMD gauge links, and saturation as the enhancement of genuine twist corrections.",19,[],2

We assume that lepton number is broken dynamically due to a lepton number carrier scalar singlet which acquires a non-zero vacuum expectation value. In the present scenario the Dark Matter particles can annihilate via equation- and equation-channels. The latter arises from the mixing between the new scalar singlet and the Higgs doublet. We identify three different Dark Matter mass regions below 1 TeV that can account for the right amount of dark matter abundance in agreement with current experimental constraints.

1912.02425,hep-ph,The proper renormalization of mixing angles in quantum field theories is a long-standing problem. It is relevant for the renormalization of the quark mixing matrix in the Standard Model and for various mixing scenarios in theories beyond. In this contribution we specifically consider theories with extended scalar sectors. We describe renormalization schemes for mixing angles based on combinations of observables or symmetry requirements such as rigid or background-field gauge invariance and compare their properties to previous approaches such as equation schemes. We formulate specific renormalization conditions for the mixing angles in the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model and the Higgs-Singlet Extension of the Standard Model and calculate electroweak corrections to Higgs-boson decays via W- or Z-boson pairs within these models for a selection of (new and old) renormalization schemes.,19,[],2

I first discuss the cusp anomalous dimension with one massive and one massless line at three loops. I then calculate the three-loop soft anomalous dimension for equation production and for related processes with new physics such as equation, equation, and equation production. This is followed by results at two and three loops for the soft anomalous dimension matrix in equation-channel single-top production and, finally, in equation-channel single-top production. These new results are needed for soft-gluon resummation at NequationLL accuracy and for calculations of soft-gluon corrections at NequationLO.",19,[],2

The modification of the radiative branching ratio due to possible constructive or destructive interferences between the meson-loop and the short-distance contact term, which is modeled by a charm quark loop, is shown. The model predictions are shown to be compatible with the experimentally determined ratio of the mentioned branching fractions for a wide range of the equation charmonium content. In the case of the destructive interference, a strong restriction on the charmonium admixture is found.",19,[],2

We provide expressions for hybrid and tetraquark static energies in terms of Wilson loops. The former have been computed in quenched lattice calculations but the latter are yet unavailable. From the few simulations with dynamical light-quarks we argue that the overall picture from hybrid static energies does not change but additional states, such as heavy meson pairs, need to be considered for a full description. In this EFT framework for quarkonium hybrids, we report on recent results for mixing with standard quarkonium, spin-dependent contributions, and semi-inclusive decays.",19,[],2
1901.03333,hep-ph,"We study phase transitions in a softly broken equation complex singlet scalar model in which the dark matter is the pseudo-scalar part of a singlet whose direct detection coupling to matter is strongly suppressed. Our aim is to find ways to test this model with the stochastic gravitational wave background from the scalar phase transition. We find that the phase transition which induces vacuum expectation values for both the Higgs boson and the singlet - necessary to provide a realistic dark matter candidate - is always of the second order. If the stochastic gravitational wave background characteristic to a first order phase transition will be discovered by interferometers, the soft breaking of equation cannot be the explanation to the suppressed dark matter-baryon coupling, providing a conclusive negative test for this class of singlet models.",19,[],2
1904.02997,hep-ph,"Approximate solutions of the Dirac equation are found for ultrarelativistic particles moving in a periodic potential, which depends only on one coordinate, transverse to the largest component of the momentum of the incoming particle. As an example we employ these solutions to calculate the radiation emission of positrons and electrons trapped in the planar potential found between the (110) planes in Silicon. This allows us to compare with the semi-classical method of Baier, Katkov and Strakhovenko, which includes the effect of spin and photon recoil, but neglects the quantization of the transverse motion. For high-energy electrons, the high-energy part of the angularly integrated photon energy spectrum calculated with the found wave functions differs from the corresponding one calculated with the semi-classical method. However, for lower particle energies it is found that the angularly integrated emission energy spectra obtained via the semi-classical method is in fairly good agreement with the full quantum calculation except that the positions of the harmonic peaks in photon energy and the photon emission angles are shifted.",19,[],2
1909.00833,hep-ph,"Recently, there has been a growing interest in extensions of the Standard Model in which naturally small Dirac neutrino masses arise due to existence of a symmetry which protects neutrino's Diracness. Motivated by this, we consider an extension of the Standard Model with a second Higgs doublet (2HDM) and three right-handed neutrinos where lepton number is conserved and, thus, neutrinos are Dirac particles. In this framework, we identify the most restrictive texture-zero combinations for the Dirac-neutrino and charged-lepton mass matrices that lead to masses and mixings compatible with current experimental data. We then investigate, in a systematic way, which of these combinations can be realized by Abelian continuous U(1) or discrete equation symmetries. We conclude that, from the 28 initially possible sets of maximally-restricted lepton mass matrices, only 5 have a symmetry realization in the 2HDM. For these cases, one-to-one relations among the Yukawa couplings and the neutrino mass and mixing parameters are established, and the fermion interactions with the neutral and charged scalars of the 2HDM are also determined. Consequences for lepton universality in equation decays and rare lepton-flavor-violating processes are also discussed.",19,[],2

This fact is exploited in a full detector level analysis that employs machine learning techniques to optimize signal sensitivity on a suite of variables, including lepton azimuthal angle. The key result of this study is an improved projected exclusion limit on equation even when including the realistic effects of detector smearing and a conservative estimate of systematic error.",19,[],2
1906.08969,hep-ph,"As one category of vector boson fusion, photo-production is one important production mechanism at equation-equation colliders. A future equation-equation collider -- Large Hadron-electron Collider (LHeC) has been discussed as a ""Higgs factory"" candidate where the Higgs boson produced via weak boson fusion (WBF) at the LHeC plays an important role in precision measurement of Yukawa couplings. On the other hand, a measurement of photo-production of the Higgs boson, if possible, might be complementary to the measurement of Higgs to di-photon partial decay width equation. In this paper, we study the possibility of measuring this production process at the LHeC with the help of the photon PDFs published in recent years. This process has a clean final state without additional colored particles in the detectable region other than the decay products of the Higgs. We compute the cross sections of all related processes and find that the production rate is at the same order as the neutral current WBF production of Higgs boson with missing forward jets. However, a detailed phenomenological study of various Higgs decay channels shows that even in the most promising semi-leptonic equation channel, the feasibility of identifying such photo-production is negative due to an irreducible photo-production of equation.",19,[],2
1903.04674,hep-ph,"We study in detail the method proposed recently to study the vector-vector interaction using the equation method and dispersion relations, which concludes that, while for equation, one finds bound states, in the case of equation, where the interaction is also attractive and much stronger, no bound state is found. In that work, approximations are done for equation and equation and a subtracted dispersion relation for equation is used, with subtractions made up to a polynomial of second degree in equation, matching the expression to equation at threshold. We study this in detail for the equation interaction and to see the convergence of the method we make an extra subtraction matching equation at threshold up to equation. We show that the method cannot be used to extrapolate the results down to 1270 MeV where the equation resonance appears, due to the artificial singularity stemming from the ""on shell"" factorization of the equation exchange potential. In addition, we explore the same method but folding this interaction with the mass distribution of the equation, and we show that the singularity disappears and the method allows one to extrapolate to low energies, where both the equation and equation expansions lead to a zero of equation, at about the same energy where a realistic approach produces a bound state. Even then, the method generates a large equation that we discuss is unphysical.",19,[],2

To present an accurate pQCD analysis, we separate the role and influence of inclusion jet production cross sections data from inclusion of the strong coupling equation as an extra fit parameter parameter on the gluon distribution. We show inclusion of jet, DiJets and TriJets production cross sections data improves the consistency between experiment and theory of cross sections for neutral current (NC) and charged current (CC) interactions of deep inelastic equation scattering on proton up to equation~\%. In addition, we show inclusion of jet production cross section data and considering equation as a pQCD free parameter not only reduce dramatically the uncertainty band of gluon distribution but also improve the consistency between experiment and theory of NC and CC deep inelastic equation scattering cross sections up to equation~\%. Our simultaneous determination of PDFs and the strong coupling equation with inclusion of jet production cross sections data leads to equation, which is in a good agreement with world average and other individual measurements.",19,[],2
1907.04722,hep-ph,"Isolating the scattering of longitudinal weak bosons at the LHC is an important tool to probe the ElectroWeak Symmetry Breaking mechanism. Separating polarizations of equation and equation bosons is complicated, because of non resonant contributions and interference effects. Additional care is necessary when considering equation bosons, due to the equation mixing in the coupling to charged leptons.   We propose a method to define polarized signals in equation and equation scattering at the LHC, which relies on the separation of weak boson polarizations at the amplitude level in Monte Carlo simulations.   After validation in the absence of lepton cuts, we investigate how polarized distributions are affected by a realistic set of kinematic cuts (and neutrino reconstruction, when needed). The total and differential polarized cross sections computed at the amplitude level are well defined, and their sum reproduces the full results, up to non negligible but computable interference effects which should be included in experimental analyses. We show that polarized cross sections computed using the reweighting method are inaccurate, particularly at large energies. We also present two procedures which address the model independent extraction of polarized components from LHC data, using Standard Model angular distribution templates.",19,[],2

Taking into account the collider bounds, we present the allowed region of new physics parameters satisfying the recent measurement of relic abundance. With the obtained parameter sets, we predict the elastic scattering cross section of the new scalar multiplet into target nuclei for a direct detection of the dark matter.

Our calculations are carried out in a coupled-channel model, where meson-meson higher Fock (or molecular-type) components are introduced in equation bare meson wave functions by means of a pair-creation mechanism. After providing a quick resume of the main characteristics of the coupled-channel model, we briefly discuss its application to the calculation of the masses of heavy quarkonium-like equation and equation states with threshold corrections. We show that the introduction of pair-creation effects in the Quark Model (QM) formalism makes it possible to explain the deviations of equation states' masses from the experimental data, without affecting the good QM description of the properties of equation states.",19,[],2

Therefore, all physically relevant properties of a model are, in principle, expressible in terms of basis-invariant combinations of the parameters. However, in many cases it becomes prohibitively difficult to establish key physical features exclusively in terms of basis invariants. Here, we advocate an alternative route in such cases: the formulation of basis-invariant statements in terms of basis-covariant objects. We give several examples where the basis-covariant path is superior to the traditional approach in terms of basis invariants. In particular, this includes the formulation of necessary and sufficient basis-invariant conditions for various physically distinct forms of CP conservation in two- and three-Higgs-doublet models.",19,[],2

Our results reduce to the known light-cone sum rules for equation form factors in the limit of a single narrow-width resonance. We update the operator-product expansion for the underlying correlation function by including a more complete set of equation-meson LCDAs with higher twists, and produce numerical results for all equation form factors in the narrow-width limit. We then use the new sum rules to estimate the effect of a non-vanishing equation width in equation transitions, and find that this effect is universal and increases the factorizable part of the rate of equation decays by a factor of equation. This effect, by itself, goes in the direction of increasing the current tension in the differential equation branching fractions.

1911.04825,hep-ph,"At high energy, exclusive meson photo- and electro-production give access to the structure of hadronic matter. At low momentum transfers, the exchange of a few Regge trajectories leads to a comprehensive account of the cross-sections. Among these trajectories, which are related to the mass spectrum of families of mesons, the Pomeron plays an interesting role as it is related to glue-ball excitations. At high momentum transfers, the exchange of these collective excitations is expected to reduce to the exchange of their simplest (quark or gluon) components. However, contributions from unitarity rescattering cuts are relevant even at high energies. In the JLab energy range, the asymptotic regime, where the players in the game are current quarks and massless gluons has not been reached yet.

The framework considered here is a gauged equation extension of standard model without the introduction of right-handed neutrinos, where the gauge triangle anomalies are canceled with the inclusion of three exotic neutral fermions equation (equation) with equation charges equation and equation. The usual Dirac Yukawa couplings between the SM neutrinos and the exotic fermions are absent and thus, the model allows natural realization of eV scale sterile-like neutrino and its mixing with standard model neutrinos by invoking equation flavor symmetry. We demonstrate how the exact tri-bimaximal mixing pattern is perturbed due to active-sterile mixing by analyzing equation case in detail. We also show the implication of eV scale sterile-like neutrino on various observables in neutrino oscillation experiments and the effective mass in neutrinoless double beta decay.

By reducing the 2T metric to the Minkowski one (1T metric), we consider the electroweak phase transition picture in the 2T model with the dilaton as the trigger. Our analysis shows that Electro-weak Phase Transition (EWPT) is a first-order phase transition at the equation GeV scale, its strength is about equation and the mass of dilaton is in interval equation GeV. Furthermore, the metric of 2T model can be reduced to the Randall-Sundrum model, so the dilaton acts as inflaton with the slow-roll approximation. Therefore the 2T-model indirectly suggests that extra-dimension can be also a source of EWPT and inflation.

The MSSM Higgs-sector predictions are evaluated in an effective field theory (EFT) framework that exhibits a Two-Higgs-Doublet-Model at the low scale. In the first scenario all SUSY particles are relatively heavy, whereas the second scenario features light neutralinos and charginos. Both scenarios are largely compatible with the most recent results from Run 2 of the LHC, and we highlight the main phenomenological features relevant for future LHC searches.

We apply our method to a simple model, containing a fermionic SU(2) triplet and a fermionic singlet with electroweak-scale masses, at small triplet-singlet mixing.

In this paper, we study the effects of a set of equation triangle diagrams, and show that due to triangle singularities such diagrams can lead to a peak around 1.4~GeV in the equation invariant mass distribution. The Dalitz plot induced by such a mechanism has a feature consistent with the BESIII observation, namely events along the band accumulate at both ends close to the Dalitz plot boundary. The effect of the same mechanism on the equation and equation decays are also investigated. We suggest to take more data for the equation and check whether the structure around equation~GeV persists for the equation invariant mass away from the equation mass region.

The equation equation should be viewed mostly as a dressed three quark state, whose origin is determined by a bare state, predicted to lie very close to the mass of the resonance. The equation equation seems to have, however, a predominant molecular structure. This is because, it is either the result of the chiral equation interaction, which threshold is located much more closer than the mass of the bare three-quark state, or because the light degrees of freedom in its inner structure are coupled to the unnatural equation quantum-numbers. We show that both situations can occur depending on the renormalization procedure used. We find some additional states, but the classification of the spectrum in terms of HQSS is difficult, despite having used interactions that respect this symmetry.

While at leading order in equation, the stress tensor multiplet four-point function can be computed from type IIA supergravity, in this work we focus on the first subleading correction, which comes from tree level Witten diagrams with an equation interaction vertex. Using superconformal Ward identities, bulk locality, and the mass deformed sphere free energy previously computed to all orders in equation from supersymmetric localization, we determine this equation correction as a function of equation. Taking its flat space limit, we recover the known equation contribution to the type IIA S-matrix and reproduce the fact that it only receives perturbative contributions in equation from genus zero and genus one string worldsheets. This is the first check of AdS/CFT at finite equation for local operators. Our result for the four-point correlator interpolates between the large equation, large 't Hooft coupling limit and the large equation finite equation limit. From the bulk perspective, this is an interpolation between type IIA string theory on equation at small string coupling and M-theory on equation.",19,[],4

To the anisotropic Lifshitz-like background geometry, we add a single flavor D7-brane treated in the probe limit. Such bulk setup corresponds to a partially quenched approximation for the dual field theory. The holographic model sheds light on the anisotropic physics induced by the layered structure, allowing one to disentangle flavor physics along and orthogonal to the layers as well as identifying distinct scaling laws for various dynamical quantities.

Applying a TsT transformation to string theory on BTZ equation we obtain a general class of rotating black string solutions, including the Horne-Horowitz and the Giveon-Itzhaki-Kutasov ones as special cases, which we show are holographically dual to thermal states in single-trace equation-deformed CFTs. We also find a smooth solution interpolating between global AdSequation in the IR and a linear dilaton background in the UV that is interpreted as the NS-NS ground state in the dual equation-deformed CFT. This background suggests the existence of an upper bound on the deformation parameter above which the solution becomes complex.

In particular, we have shown that the most general even-point amplitudes of a colored-scalar satisfying the Kleiss-Kuijf (KK) and Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) relations are compatible with the non-linear sigma model symmetries. Similarly, their double copy is compatible with the special galileon symmetries. We showed this by fixing the dimensionless coefficients of these effective field theories in such a way that the arising amplitudes are compatible with the double copy procedure. We find that this can be achieved for the even-point amplitudes, but not for the odd ones. These results imply that not all operators invariant under the shift symmetries under consideration are compatible with the double copy.",19,[],4

The parameters are the WZ level equation and the coupling equation, and the fields are equation, valued in a group equation, and a 2d vector equation in the corresponding algebra. We formulate the equation-model as a equation-model on an extended equation configuration space equation, defining equation and equation by equation, equation. Our central observation is that the model on this extended configuration space is renormalizable without any deformation, with only equation running. This is in contrast to the standard equation-model found by integrating out equation, whose 2-loop renormalizability is only obtained after the addition of specific finite local counterterms, resulting in a quantum deformation of the target space geometry.

1905.00434,hep-th,"The most general operator product expansion in conformal field theory is obtained using the embedding space formalism and a new uplift for general quasi-primary operators. The uplift introduced here, based on quasi-primary operators with spinor indices only and standard projection operators, allows a unified treatment of all quasi-primary operators irrespective of their Lorentz group irreducible representations. This unified treatment works at the level of the operator product expansion and hence applies to all correlation functions. A very useful differential operator appearing in the operator product expansion is established and its action on appropriate products of embedding space coordinates is explicitly computed. This computation leads to tensorial generalizations of the usual Exton function for all correlation functions. Several important identities and contiguous relations are also demonstrated for these new tensorial functions. From the operator product expansion all correlation functions for all quasi-primary operators, irrespective of their Lorentz group irreducible representations, can be computed recursively in a systematic way. The resulting answer can be expressed in terms of tensor structures that carry all the Lorentz group information and linear combinations of the new tensorial functions.

To avoid this divergence, we modify the original conjecture, where we assume that the complexity of the boundary state equals the boundary actions contributed by the null segments as well as the joints of the Wheeler-DeWitt patch. Then, the late time growth rate of this modified holographic complexity is given by entropy equation times temperature equation, which is quite in agreement with the circuit analysis.

1903.05925,hep-th,"There exists a clear physical motivation for theoretical studies of the vacuum instability related to the production of electron-positron pairs from a vacuum due to strong external electric fields. Various nonperturbative (with respect to the external fields) calculation methods were developed. Some of these methods are based on possible exact solutions of the Dirac equation. Unfortunately, there are only few cases when such solutions are known. Recently, an approximate but still nonperturbative approach to treat the vacuum instability caused by slowly varying equation-electric potential steps (time dependent external fields that vanish as equation), which does not depend on the existence of the corresponding exact solutions, was formulated in Ref. [S. P. Gavrilov, D. M. Gitman, Phys. Rev. D \textbf95, 076013 (2017)]. Here, we present an approximate calculation method to treat nonperturbatively the vacuum instability in arbitrary weakly inhomogeneous equation-electric potential steps (time-independent electric fields of a constant direction that are concentrated in restricted space areas, which means that the fields vanish as equation) in the absence of the corresponding exact solutions. Defining the weakly inhomogeneous regime in general terms, we demonstrate the universal character of the vacuum instability. This universality is associated with a large density of states excited from the vacuum by the electric field. Such a density appears in our approach as a large parameter. We derive universal representations for the total number and current density of the created particles. Relations of these representations with a locally constant field approximation for Schwinger's effective action are found.",19,[],4

For states of fixed area on the equation HRT-surfaces, we argue that the bulk geometry equation dual to the newly sewn state is given by deleting the entanglement wedges of equation from equation, gluing the remaining complementary entanglement wedges of equation together across the HRT surface, and solving the equations of motion to the past and future. The argument uses the bulk path integral and assumes it to be dominated by a certain natural saddle. For states where the HRT area is not fixed, the same bulk cut-and-paste is dual to a modified sewing that produces a generalization of the canonical purification state equation discussed recently by Dutta and Faulkner.

1910.08080,hep-th,"Certain gauge transformations may act non-trivially on physical states in quantum electrodynamics (QED). This observation has sparked the yet unresolved question of how to characterize allowed boundary conditions for gauge theories. Faddeev and Jackiw proposed to impose Gauss' law on the action to find the Hamiltonian reduced theory of QED. The reduction eliminates the scalar gauge mode, renders the theory manifestly gauge invariant and the symplectic form non-singular. In this work we show that while the predictions of the reduced theory coincide with those of conventional QED for scattering events, it is experimentally distinguishable. Quantum interference of charges traveling along time-like Wilson loops that encircle (but remain clear of) electric fields is sensitive to a relative phase shift due to an interaction with the scalar potential. This is the archetypal electric Aharonov-Bohm effect and does not exist in the reduced theory. Despite its prediction over six decades ago, and in contrast to its well known magnetic counterpart, this electric Aharonov-Bohm phenomenon has never been observed.

1902.02309,hep-th,"Soft-operators, loosely speaking, are operators which create or annihilate zero energy massless particles on the celestial sphere in Minkowski space. The Lorentz group acts on the celestial sphere by conformal transformation and the soft-operators transform as conformal primary operators of various dimension and spin. Working in space-time dimensions equation and equation, we study some properties of the conformal representations with the (leading) soft photon and graviton as the highest weight vectors. Typically these representations contain null-vectors. We argue, from the equation-matrix point of view, that infinite dimensional asymptotic symmetries and conformal invariance require us to set some of these null-vectors to zero. As a result, the corresponding soft-operator satisfies linear PDE on the celestial sphere. Curiously, these PDEs are equations of motion of Euclidean gauge theories on the celestial sphere with scalar gauge-invariance, i.e, the gauge parameter is a scalar field on the sphere. These are probably related to large equation and supertranslation transformations at infinity. Now, the PDE satisfied by the soft-operator can be converted into PDE for the equation-matrix elements with the insertion of the soft-operator. These equations can then be solved subject to appropriate boundary conditions on the celestial sphere, provided by conformal invariance. The solutions determine the soft equation-matrix elements, for different helicities of the soft-particle, in terms of a single scalar function. This makes the Ward-identity for the asymptotic symmetry almost integrable. The result of the integration, which we are not able to perform completely, should of course be Weinberg's soft-theorem.

Posteriorly, we determine the bound-state solutions of the system: the Dirac spinor and the relativistic energy spectrum. We verified that this spinor is written in terms of the generalized Laguerre polynomials and this spectrum depends on the effective quantum number equation, angular velocity equation and parameter equation associated to the noninertial and spin effects, magnetic flux equation, cyclotron frequency equation, zero-point energy equation, and on the deficit angle equation. In particular, we note that besides this spectrum to be a periodic function and asymmetric, its values infinitely increase when equation or equation. We also note that the energies of the antiparticle with spin down are larger than of the particle with spin up or down.

1912.13502,hep-th,"We study the spectrum of BPS particles on the Coulomb branch of five-dimensional superconformal field theories (5d SCFTs) compactified on a circle. By engineering these theories in M-theory on equation, for equation an isolated Calabi-Yau threefold singularity, we naturally identify the BPS category of the 5d theory on a circle with the derived category of coherent sheaves on a resolution of equation. It follows that the BPS spectrum can be studied in terms of 5d BPS quivers, which are the fractional-brane quivers for the singularity equation. 5d BPS quivers generalize the well-studied 4d BPS quivers for 4d equation gauge theories that can be obtained from equation in so-called geometric engineering limits. We study the interplay between 4d and 5d BPS quivers in detail. We particularly focus on examples when equation is a toric singularity, in which case the 5d BPS quiver is given in terms of a brane tiling. For instance, the well-studied equation brane tiling gives a 5d BPS quiver for the equation 5d gauge theory. We present a conjecture about the structure of the BPS spectra of a wide class of models, which we test in the simple case of the 5d equation theory (more precisely, the equation SCFT). We also argue that 5d UV dualities can be realized in terms of mutation sequences on the BPS quivers, which are in turn interpreted as autoequivalences of the BPS category.",19,[],4

In particular, we perform a mixed correlator bootstrap study of the superconformal primaries of the stress tensor multiplet and of the next possible lowest-dimension half-BPS multiplet that is allowed by 3d equation superconformal symmetry. Of all known 3d equation SCFTs, the equation ABJM theory is the only one that contains both types of multiplets in its operator spectrum. By imposing the values of the short OPE coefficients that can be computed exactly using supersymmetric localization, we are able to derive precise islands in the space of semi-short OPE coefficients for an infinite number of such coefficients. We find that these islands decrease in size with increasing equation. More generally, we also analyze 3d equation SCFT that contain both aforementioned multiplets in their operator spectra without inputing any additional information that is specific to ABJM theory. For such theories, we compute upper and lower bounds on the semi-short OPE coefficients as well as upper bounds on the scaling dimension of the lowest unprotected scalar operator.

Then we apply the Crank-Nicolson method to evolve our Dirac equation in the double null coordinates and extract the low-lying quasinormal modes from the evolution data by the Prony method. It is shown for the spacetime dimension equation under consideration that although the strong cosmic censorship is violated by the perturbation from the neutral Dirac field in the near-extremal black hole, the strong cosmic censorship can be restored when the charge of the Dirac field is increased beyond a critical value.

The TQFT expressions for these latter theories are related by simple transformations to the corresponding quantities for certain well-known isolated theories with regular punctures (e.g., the Minahan-Nemeschansky equation theory and various generalizations). We then reinterpret the TQFT expressions for the indices of our AD theories in terms of the topology of the corresponding 3D mirror quivers, and we show that our isolated AD theories generically admit renormalization group (RG) flows to interacting superconformal field theories (SCFTs) with thirty-two (Poincar\'e plus special) supercharges. Motivated by these examples, we argue that, in a sense we make precise, the existence of RG flows to interacting SCFTs with thirty-two supercharges is generic in a far larger class of 4D equation SCFTs arising from compactifications of the 6D equation theory on surfaces with irregular singularities.",19,[],4

Such a four-point function can be computed, on the gravity side, as a two-point function of the light operator in a black hole geometry created by the heavy operator. We consider analytically solving the corresponding scalar field equation in a near-boundary expansion and find that the multi-stress tensor conformal blocks are insensitive to the horizon boundary condition. The main result of this paper is that the lowest-twist operator product expansion (OPE) coefficients of the multi-stress tensor conformal blocks are universal: they are fixed by the dimension of the light operators and the ratio between the dimension of the heavy operator and the central charge equation. Neither supersymmetry nor unitary is assumed. Higher-twist coefficients, on the other hand, generally are not protected. A recursion relation allows us to efficiently compute universal lowest-twist coefficients.

1911.06002,hep-th,"The search for a relation among GR, QFT and TFT is the toughest challenge of theoretical physics since Hawking's discovery. The emergence of a temperature in spacetimes with an event horizon has unveiled the existence of a fertile territory, where gravity, thermal and quantum effects are non-trivially connected. Although black holes are the best arena to explore this interplay, evidences for their existence are lacking, suggesting to address less exotic contexts. In this sense, a promising stage is the QFT in curved space: specifically, the Unruh effect (UE) provides the first step toward unifying the quantum and gravity worlds via the EP. Waiting for a successful theory of quantum gravity, a careful investigation of UE, and, in particular, of any deviations of Unruh spectrum from its thermal behavior, may thus offer a window to new physics in the limbo between GR and QFT. Here we study the connection between geometric features of spacetime and ensuing thermal quantum phenomena from a non-traditional perspective, based on the analysis of perturbative effects that affect the standard scenarios. As a test bench, we consider the UE. After a discussion on the origin of UE, we examine to what extent its distinctive profile is spoilt i) for mixed neutrinos; ii) in presence of a minimal length arising from gravity at Planck scale. On one side, we show that the UE loses its thermality. Implications of this are analyzed in the context of the inverse beta-decay, also in view of the debate on a possible violation of the General Covariance of QFT. On the other, we focus on the effects induced by deformations of HUP, exploring the possibility to constrain the GUP-parameter via UE.

An explicit illustration of these issues is presented in a simple and most familiar model that applies also to the constant gravitational force. This note draws its primary motivation from the quest towards a theory for quantum gravity, in wanting to understand better the tension existing between the local Equivalence Principle of the gravitational interaction and the fundamental principles of Quantum Mechanics by considering the formulation of quantum systems relative to reference frames that are inertial or noninertial, and thus accelerated relative to one another through arbitrary time dependent spatial translations.",19,[],4

1911.12726,math,"The notion of surreal number was introduced by J.H. Conway in the mid 1970's: the surreal numbers constitute a linearly ordered (proper) class equation containing the class of all ordinal numbers (equation) that, working within the background set theory NBG, can be defined by a recursion on the class equation. Since then, have appeared many constructions of this class and was isolated a full axiomatization of this notion that been subject of interest due to large number of interesting properties they have, including model-theoretic ones. Such constructions suggests strong connections between the class equation of surreal numbers and the classes of all sets and all ordinal numbers.   In an attempt to codify the universe of sets directly within the surreal number class, we have founded some clues that suggest that this class is not suitable for this purpose. The present work, that expounds parts of the PhD thesis of the first author (\citeRan18), establishes a basis to obtain an ""algebraic (set) theory for surreal numbers"" along the lines of the Algebraic Set Theory - a categorial set theory introduced in the 1990's based on the concept of ZF-algebra: to establish abstract and general links between the class of all surreal numbers and a universe of ""surreal sets"" similar to the relations between the class of all ordinals (equation) and the class of all sets (equation), that also respects and expands the links between the linearly ordered class of all ordinals and of all surreal numbers.",19,[],0
1905.08049,math,"Recently the first named author defined a 2-parametric family of groups equation \citegnk. Those groups may be regarded as a certain generalisation of braid groups. Study of the connection between the groups equation and dynamical systems led to the discovery of the following fundamental principle: ""If dynamical systems describing the motion of equation particles possess a nice codimension one property governed by exactly equation particles, then these dynamical systems admit a topological invariant valued in equation"".   The equation groups have connections to different algebraic structures, Coxeter groups and Kirillov-Fomin algebras, to name just a few. Study of the equation groups led to, in particular, the construction of invariants, valued in free products of cyclic groups.   Later the first and the fourth named authors introduced and studied the second family of groups, denoted by equation, which are closely related to triangulations of manifolds.   The spaces of triangulations of a given manifolds have been widely studied. The celebrated theorem of Pachner \citepach says that any two triangulations of a given manifold can be connected by a sequence of bistellar moves or Pachner moves. See also \citeGelKapZel,nab; the equation naturally appear when considering the set of triangulations with the fixed number of points.   There are two ways of introducing this groups: the geometrical one, which depends on the metric, and the topological one. The second one can be thought of as a ""braid group"" of the manifold and, by definition, is an invariant of the topological type of manifold; in a similar way, one can construct the smooth version.

1909.01882,math,"By the density of a finite graph we mean its average vertex degree. For an equation-generated group, the density of its Cayley graph in a given set of generators, is the supremum of densities taken over all its finite subgraphs. It is known that a group with equation generators is amenable iff the density of the corresponding Cayley graph equals equation. A famous problem on the amenability of R.\,Thompson's group equation is still open. What is known due to the result by Belk and Brown, is that the density of its Cayley graph in the standard set of group generators equation, is at least equation. This estimate has not been exceeded so far. For the set of symmetric generators equation, where equation, the same example gave the estimate only equation. There was a conjecture that for this generating set the equality holds. If so, equation would be non-amenable, and the symmetric generating set had doubling property. This means that for any finite set equation, the inequality equation holds.

1906.05589,math,"E-functions are entire functions with algebraic Taylor coefficients satisfying certain arithmetic conditions, and which are also solutions of linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients. They were introduced by Siegel in 1929 to generalize the Diophantine properties of the exponential and Bessel's functions. The Siegel-Shidlovskii Theorem (1956) deals with the algebraic (in)dependence of values at algebraicpoints of E-functions solutions of a differential system. In this paper, we prove the existence of an algorithm to perfom the following three tasks. Given as inputs some E-functions equation, (1) it computes a system of generators of the ideal of polynomial relations between equation; (2) given any algebraic number equation, it computes a system of generators of the ideal of polynomial relations between the values equation with algebraic coefficients;(3) if equation are algebraically independent, it determines the finite set of all algebraic numbers equation such that the values equation are algebraically dependent. The existence of this algorithm relies on a variant of the Hrushovski-Feng algorithm (to compute polynomial relations between solutions of differential systems) and on Beukers' lifting theorem (an optimal refinement of the Siegel-Shidlovskii theorem) in order to reduce the problem to an effective elimination procedure in multivariate polynomial rings.

This approach allows to stabilize unstable and chaotic maps by noise. The interplay between the map properties and the allowed neighbourhood where a solution can start to be stabilized is explored: as instability of the original map increases, the interval of allowed initial conditions narrows. A directed stochastic control aiming at getting to the target neighbourhood almost sure is combined with a controlling noise.

1908.02359,math,"We introduce a new method, which we call stochastic fusion, which takes an exclusion process and constructs an interacting particle systems in which more than one particle may occupy a lattice site. The construction only requires the existence of stationary measures of the original exclusion process on a finite lattice. If the original exclusion process satisfies Markov duality on a finite lattice, then the construction produces Markov duality functions (for some initial conditions) for the fused exclusion process. The stochastic fusion construction is based off of the Rogers-Pitman intertwining.   In particular, we have results for three types of models:   1. For symmetric exclusion processes, the fused process and duality functions are inhomogeneous generalizations of those in \citeGKRV. The construction also allows a general class of open boundary conditions: as an application of the duality, we find the hydrodynamic limit and stationary measures of the generalized symmetric simple exclusion process SSEPequation on equation for open boundary conditions.   2. For the asymmetric simple exclusion process, the fused process and duality functions are inhomogeneous generalizations of those found in \citeCGRS for the ASEPequation. As a by-product of the construction, we show that the multi-species ASEPequation preserves equation-exchangeable measures, and use this to find new duality functions for the ASEP, ASEPequation and equation-Boson. Additionally, the construction leads to duality for ASEP with open boundary conditions. As an application of the latter duality, we find the hydrodynamic limit.   3. For dynamic models, we fuse the dynamic ASEP from \citeBorodinDyn, and produce a dynamic and inhomogeneous version of ASEPequation.

However, the interaction structures among oscillators are static in most of studies on chimera state. In this work, we consider a population of agents. Each agent carries a phase oscillator. We assume that agents perform Brownian motions on a ring and interact with each other with a kernel function dependent on the distance between them. When agents are motionless, the model allows for several dynamical states including two different chimera states (the type-I and the type-II chimeras). The movement of agents changes the relative positions among them and produces perpetual noise to impact on the model dynamics. We find that the response of the coupled phase oscillators to the movement of agents depends on both the phase lag equation, determining the stabilities of chimera states, and the agent mobility equation. For low mobility, the synchronous state transits to the type-I chimera state for equation close to equation and attracts other initial states otherwise. For intermediate mobility, the coupled oscillators randomly jump among different dynamical states and the jump dynamics depends on equation.

1910.09698,nlin,"The Jacobian matrix of a dynamical system describes its response to perturbations. Conversely one can estimate the Jacobian matrix by carefully monitoring how the system responds to environmental noise. Here we present a closed form analytical solution for the calculation of a system's Jacobian from a timeseries. Being able to access a system's Jacobian enables us to perform a broad range of mathematical analyses by which deeper insights into the system can be gained. Here we consider in particular the computation of the leading Jacobian eigenvalue as an early warning signal for critical transition. To illustrate this approach we apply it to ecological meta-foodweb models, which are strongly nonlinear dynamical multi-layer networks. Our analysis shows that accurate results can be obtained, although the data demand of the method is still high.",19,[],9

1910.06653,nlin,"In the manifold theory of spiral structure in barred galaxies, the usual assumption is that the spirals rotate with the same pattern speed as the bar. Here we generalize the manifold theory under the assumption that the spirals rotate with different pattern speed than the bar. More generally, we consider the case when one or more modes, represented by the potentials V2, V3, \ldots, co-exist in the galactic disc in addition to the bar's mode Vbar, but rotate with pattern speeds letter2, letter3, \ldots incommensurable between themselves and with letterbar. Through a perturbative treatment (assuming that V2,V3... are small with respect to Vbar) we then show that the unstable Lagrangian points L1, L2 of the pure bar model (Vbar,letterbar) are `continued' in the full model as periodic orbits, when we have one extra pattern speed different from letterbar, or as epicyclic `Lissajous-like' unstable orbits, when we have more than one extra pattern speeds. As an example we compute the generalized orbits GL1, GL2 and their manifolds in a Milky-way like model with bar and spiral pattern speeds assumed different. We find that the manifolds produce a time-varying morphology consisting of segments of spirals or `pseudorings'. These structures are repeated after a period equal to half the relative period of the imposed spirals with respect to the bar. Along one period, the manifold-induced time-varying structures are found to continuously support at least some part of the imposed spirals, except at short intervals around those times at which the relative phase of the imposed spirals with respect to the bar becomes equal to letter/2. A connection of these effects to the phenomenon of recurrent spirals is discussed.",19,[],9

Typically, these representations are formulated under certain assumptions, such as when solutions converge to attractor states using linear stability analysis or using projections of large-scale dynamical data into a set of lower dimensional modes that are selected heuristically. Here, we propose a generative framework for selection of lower dimensional modes onto which the entire network dynamics can be projected based on the symmetry of the input distribution for a large-scale network driven by external inputs, thus relaxing the heuristic selection of modes made in the earlier reduction approaches. The proposed mode reduction technique is tractable analytically and applied to different kinds of real-world large-scale network scenarios with nodes comprising of a) Van der Pol oscillators b) Hindmarsh-Rose neurons. These two demonstrations elucidate how order parameter is conserved at original and reduced descriptions thus validating our proposition.",19,[],9

1912.05052,nlin,"In this work we revisit a classical problem of traveling waves in a damped Frenkel-Kontorova lattice driven by a constant external force. We compute these solutions as fixed points of a nonlinear map and obtain the corresponding kinetic relation between the driving force and the velocity of the wave for different values of the damping coefficient. We show that the kinetic curve can become non-monotone at small velocities, due to resonances with linear modes, and also at large velocities where the kinetic relation becomes multivalued. Exploring the spectral stability of the obtained waveforms, we identify, at the level of numerical accuracy of our computations, a precise criterion for instability of the traveling wave solutions: monotonically decreasing portions of the kinetic curve always bear an unstable eigendirection. We discuss why the validity of this criterion in the \it dissipative setting is a rather remarkable feature offering connections to the Hamiltonian variant of the model and of lattice traveling waves more generally.

Recently, the emergence of such fascinating phenomena has been studied in three-dimensional (3D) grid formation while considering only the nonlocal interaction. Here we study the emergence and existence of chimera patterns in a three dimensional network of coupled Stuart-Landau limit cycle oscillators and Hindmarsh-Rose neuronal oscillators with local (nearest neighbour) interaction topology. The emergence of different types of spatiotemporal chimera patterns is investigated by taking two distinct nonlinear interaction functions. We provide appropriate analytical explanations in the 3D grid of network formation and the corresponding numerical justifications are given. We extend our analysis on the basis of Ott-Antonsen reduction approach in the case of Stuart-Landau oscillators containing infinite number of oscillators. Particularly, in Hindmarsh-Rose neuronal network the existence of non-stationary chimera states are characterized by instantaneous strength of incoherence and instantaneous local order parameter.

We show that the slow adaptation in comparison with the fast phase dynamics is necessary for the emergence of the multi-clusters and their stability. Additionally, we study the role of double antipodal clusters, which appear to be unstable for all considered parameter values.

A geometrical explanation for such an effect is based on the emergence of a heteroclinic orbit.",19,[],9
1908.00254,nlin,"The role of counter-rotating oscillators in an ensemble of coexisting co- and counter-rotating oscillators is examined by increasing the proportion of the latter. The phenomenon of aging transition was identified at a critical value of the ratio of the counter-rotating oscillators, which was otherwise realized only by increasing the number of inactive oscillators to a large extent. The effect of the mean-field feedback strength in the symmetry preserving coupling is also explored. The parameter space of aging transition was increased abruptly even for a feeble decrease in the feedback strength and subsequently, the aging transition was observed at a critical value of the feedback strength surprisingly without any counter-rotating oscillators. Further, the study was extended to symmetry breaking coupling using conjugate variables and it was observed that the symmetry breaking coupling can facilitating the onset of aging transition even in the absence of counter-rotating oscillators and for the unit value of the feedback strength. In general, the parameter space of aging transition was found to increase by increasing the frequency of oscillators and by increasing the proportion of the counter-rotating oscillators in both the symmetry preserving and symmetry breaking couplings. Further, the transition from oscillatory to aging transition occurs via a Hopf bifurcation, while the transition from aging transition to oscillation death state emerges via Pitchfork bifurcation. Analytical expressions for the critical ratio of the counter- rotating oscillators are deduced to find the stable boundaries of the aging transition.",19,[],9

The transient chaotic dynamics along with the multistable nature of frustrated systems facilitates the existence of complex basin structures such as fractal and riddled basins. In particular, we report the emergence of transient chaotic dynamics around the chaotic itinerancy region, where the basin of attraction near the chaotic region is riddled and it becomes fractal basin when we move away from this region. Normally the complex basin structures are observed only for oscillatory states but surprisingly it is also observed even for oscillation death states.

This method allows computation of solutions to all cases of the Kaup--Broer system. We then consider the case of non-capillary waves with usual gravitational forcing, and use the dressing method to compute N-soliton solutions and more general solutions in the closure of the N-soliton solutions in the topology of uniform convergence in compact sets called primitive solutions.

Taking an altogether different cue in the present work, we consider inter-layer adaptive coupling in a multiplex network of phase oscillators and show that the scheme gives rise to ES with an associated hysteresis irrespective of the network architecture of individual layers. The hysteresis is shaped by the inter-layer coupling strength and the frequency mismatch between the mirror nodes. We provide rigorous mean-field analytical treatment for the measure of global coherence and manifest they are in a good match with respective numerical assessments. Moreover, the analytical predictions provide a complete insight into how adaptive multiplexing suppresses the formation of a giant cluster, eventually giving birth to ES.

This model represents the solution as an attractor in the phase space and also finds a new solution automatically when perturbations such as variations in the end position of the arm or obstacles occur. In the proposed model, the physical constraints, target position, and the existence of obstacles are represented by network connections.

Frequency of the variation is much smaller then the natural frequency of the oscillator so that oscillations in the system are periodically excited and decay. Also a time delay as added such that when the oscillations start to grow at a new excitation stage they are influenced via the delay line by the oscillations at the penultimate excitation stage. Due to a nonlinearity the seeding from the past arrives with a doubled phase so that oscillation phase changes from stage to stage according to chaotic Bernoulli-type map. As a result, the system operates as two coupled hyperbolic chaotic subsystems. Varying the relation between the delay time and the excitation period we affect a coupling strength between these subsystems as well as intensity of the phase doubling mechanism responsible for the hyperbolicity. Due to this, a transition from non-hyperbolic to hyperbolic hyperchaos occurs. The following steps of the transition scenario are revealed and analyzed: (a) an intermittency as alternation of long staying near a fixed point at the origin and short chaotic bursts; (b) chaotic oscillations with often visits to the fixed point; (c) plain hyperchaos without hyperbolicity after termination visiting the fixed point; (d) transformation of hyperchaos to hyperbolic form.",19,[],9

We show that the introduction of even a small inhomogeneity in the injected beam widens the stability region of localized solutions. The homoclinic snaking bifurcation associated with the formation of localized structures and clusters of them with decaying oscillatory tails is constructed. Furthermore, the inhomogeneity allows not only to control the position of localized solutions, but strongly affects their stability domains. In particular, a new stability domain of a single peak localized structure appears outside of the region of multistability between multiple peaks of localized states. We identify a regime of larger detuning, where localized structures do not exhibit a snaking behavior. In this regime, the effect of inhomogeneities on localized solutions is far more complex: they can act either attracting or repelling. We identify the pitchfork bifurcation responsible for this transition.

1907.02276,nlin,"Phase reduction is a powerful technique that makes possible describe the dynamics of a weakly perturbed limit-cycle oscillator in terms of its phase.

Still, the Kuramoto model is a first-order phase approximation that displays either full synchronization or incoherence, but none of the nontrivial dynamics of the MF-CGLE. This fact calls for an expansion beyond the first order in the coupling constant. We develop an isochron-based scheme to obtain the second-order phase approximation, which reproduces the weak coupling dynamics of the MF-CGLE. The practicality of our method is evidenced by extending the calculation up to third order.

This can be interpreted as a Fourier decomposition of a general equation-periodic interaction function. We show that in the case where only one multiple of the angle differences is considered, which we refer to as the ""Kuramoto model with simple equationth-order coupling,"" the system is dynamically equivalent to the original Kuramoto model.

1903.08300,nlin,"This work uses the statistical properties of Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLEs) to investigate the Intermittent Stickiness Synchronization (ISS) observed in the mixed phase space of high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems. Full Stickiness Synchronization (SS) occurs when all FTLEs from a chaotic trajectory tend to zero for arbitrary long time-windows. This behavior is a consequence of the sticky motion close to regular structures which live in the high-dimensional phase space and affects all unstable directions proportionally by the same amount, generating a kind of collective motion. Partial SS occurs when at least one FTLE approaches to zero. Thus, distinct degrees of partial SS may occur, depending on the values of nonlinearity and coupling parameters, on the dimension of the phase space and on the number of positive FTLEs. Through filtering procedures used to precisely characterize the sticky motion, we are able to compute the algebraic decay exponents of the ISS and to obtain remarkable evidence about the existence of a universal behavior related to the decay of time correlations encoded in such exponents. In addition, we show that even though the probability to find full SS is small compared to partial SSs, the full SS may appear for very long times due to the slow algebraic decay of time correlations in mixed phase space. In this sense, observations of very late intermittence between chaotic motion and full SSs become rare events.",19,[],9

Then a general form of nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger (NNLS) equation with shifted parity, charge-conjugate and delayed time reversal is obtained by using multi-scale expansion method. Some kinds of elliptic periodic wave solutions of the NNLS equation are obtained by using function expansion method, which contain soliton solutions and kink solutions when the modulus taking as unity.

1906.03665,nlin,"We study a 2-dimensional model for an antidot periodic superlattice with perturbed positions of the antidots. To do so we use a quasiperiodic LG model obtained from a 3-dimensional billiard model. Our results show that infinite drifting trajectories present in the periodic antidot models disappear, but if the perturbation is small enough, those trajectories remain for long times. The probability to visit the region of the phase space where electrons have ballistic behavior tends to equation as the length of the drifting trajectories tends to infinity, leading to separation of these regions in phase space. As a result, we infer that the particles follow Levy walks and the system has superdiffusive behavior for short times.

We investigate here the collective dynamical behavior in a long-range interacting system consisting of coupled Stuart-Landau limit cycle oscillators. In particular, we analyze the impact of a repulsive coupling along with symmetry breaking coupling. We report that the addition of repulsive coupling of sufficient strength can induce a swing of the synchronized state which will start disappearing with an increasing disorder as a function of the repulsive coupling. We also deduce analytical stability conditions for the oscillatory states including synchronized state, solitary state, two-cluster state as well as oscillation death state.

1911.06113,nlin,"Networks of excitable elements are widely used to model real-world biological and social systems. The dynamic range of an excitable network quantifies the range of stimulus intensities that can be robustly distinguished by the network response, and is maximized at the critical state. In this study, we examine the impacts of backtracking activation on system criticality in excitable networks consisting of both excitatory and inhibitory units. We find that, for dynamics with refractory states that prohibit backtracking activation, the critical state occurs when the largest eigenvalue of the weighted non-backtracking (WNB) matrix for excitatory units, equation, is close to one, regardless of the strength of inhibition. In contrast, for dynamics without refractory state in which backtracking activation is allowed, the strength of inhibition affects the critical condition through suppression of backtracking activation. As inhibitory strength increases, backtracking activation is gradually suppressed. Accordingly, the system shifts continuously along a continuum between two extreme regimes -- from one where the criticality is determined by the largest eigenvalue of the weighted adjacency matrix for excitatory units, equation, to the other where the critical state is reached when equation is close to one. For systems in between, we find that equation and equation at the critical state. These findings, confirmed by numerical simulations using both random and synthetic neural networks, indicate that backtracking activation impacts the criticality of excitable networks.",19,[],9

SEsM contains as particular case the Modified Method of Simplest Equation (MMSE) for the case when we use one simple equation and the solution is searched as power series of the solution of the simple equation. SEsM contains as particular cases many other methodologies for obtaining exact solutions of non-linear partial differential equations.

The clustering leads to a splitting of a neural population into a few groups synchronized at different frequencies. In this regime, the amplitude of the mean field undergoes low-frequency modulations, which may contribute to the mechanism of the emergence of slow oscillations of neural activity observed in spectral power of local field potentials or electroencephalographic signals at high frequencies. In addition to numerical simulations of such multi-clusters, we investigate the mechanisms of the observed phenomena using the simplest case of two clusters. In particular, we propose a phenomenological model which describes the dynamics of two clusters taking into account the adaptation of coupling weights.

This analysis shows a strong dependence of their stability on the coupling structure and the wavenumber which is a remarkable difference to an all-to-all coupled network. Despite the fact that solitary states have been observed in a plethora of dynamical systems, the mechanisms behind their emergence were largely unaddressed in the literature.

1912.05589,nlin,"General rogue waves are derived for the generalized derivative nonlinear Schrodinger (GDNLS) equations by a bilinear Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) reduction method. These GDNLS equations contain the Kaup-Newell equation, the Chen-Lee-Liu equation and the Gerdjikov-Ivanov equation as special cases. In this bilinear framework, it is shown that rogue waves to all members of these equations are expressed by the same bilinear solution. Compared to previous bilinear KP reduction methods for rogue waves in other integrable equations, an important improvement in our current KP reduction procedure is a new parameterization of internal parameters in rogue waves. Under this new parameterization, the rogue wave expressions through elementary Schur polynomials are much simpler. In addition, the rogue wave with the highest peak amplitude at each order can be obtained by setting all those internal parameters to zero, and this maximum peak amplitude at order equation turns out to be equation times the background amplitude, independent of the individual GDNLS equation and the background wavenumber. It is also reported that these GDNLS equations can be decomposed into two different bilinear systems which require different KP reductions, but the resulting rogue waves remain the same. Dynamics of rogue waves in the GDNLS equations is also analyzed. It is shown that the wavenumber of the constant background strongly affects the orientation and duration of the rogue wave.

1901.03563,nlin,"We investigate different emergent dynamics namely oscillation quenching and revival of oscillation in a global network of identical oscillators coupled with diffusive (positive) delay coupling as it is perturbed by symmetry breaking localized repulsive delayed interaction. Starting from the oscillatory states (OS) we systematically identify three types of transition phenomena in the parameter space: (1) The system may reach inhomogeneous steady states (IHSS) from the homogeneous steady state (HSS) sometimes called as the transition from amplitude death (AD) to oscillation death (OD) state i.e. OS-AD-OD scenario, (2) Revival of oscillation (OS) from the AD state (OS-AD-OS) and (3) Emergence of OD state from oscillatory state (OS) without passing through AD i.e. OS-OD. The dynamics of each node in the network is assumed to be governed either by identical limit cycle Stuart-Landau system or by chaotic Rossler system. Based on clustering behavior observed in oscillatory network we derive a reduced low-dimensional model of the large network. Using the reduced model, we investigate the effect of time delay on these transitions and demarcate OS, AD and OD regimes in the parameter space. We also explore and characterize the bifurcation transitions present in both systems. The generic behavior of the low dimensional model and full network are found to match satisfactorily.",19,[],9
1905.13451,nucl-th,"The Perey-effect in two-body channels of equation reactions has been known for a long time. It arises when the nonlocal two-body deuteron-target and/or proton-target problem is approximated by a local one, manifesting itself in a reduction of the scattering channel wave functions in the nuclear interior. However, the equation reaction mechanism requires explicit accounting for three-body dynamics involving the target and the neutron and proton in the deuteron. Treating nonlocality of the nucleon-target interactions within a three-body context requires significant effort and demands going beyond the widely-used adiabatic approximation, which can be done using a continuum-discretized coupled-channel (CDCC) method. However, the inclusion of nonlocal interactions into the CDCC description of equation reactions has not been developed yet. Here, we point out that, similarly to the two-body nonlocal case, nonlocality in a three-body channel can be accounted for by introducing the Perey factors. We explain this procedure and present the first CDCC calculations to our knowledge including the Perey-effect.",19,[],11

1908.00765,nucl-th,"The reach of ab initio many-body theories is rapidly extending over the nuclear chart. However, dealing fully with three-nucleon, possibly four-nucleon, interactions makes the solving of the A-body Schrodinger equation particularly cumbersome, if not impossible beyond a certain nuclear mass. Consequently, ab initio calculations of mid-mass nuclei are typically performed on the basis of the normal-ordered two-body (NO2B) approximation that captures dominant effects of three-nucleon forces while effectively working with two-nucleon operators. A powerful idea currently employed to extend ab initio calculations to open-shell nuclei consists of expanding the exact solution of the A-body Schrodinger equation while authorizing the approximate solution to break symmetries of the Hamiltonian. In this context, operators are normal ordered with respect to a symmetry-breaking reference state such that proceeding to a naive truncation may lead to symmetry-breaking approximate operators. The purpose of the present work is to design a normal-ordering approximation of operators that is consistent with the symmetries of the Hamiltonian while working in the context of symmetry broken (and potentially restored) methods. Focusing on many-body formalisms in which U(1) global-gauge symmetry associated with particle number conservation is broken (and potentially restored), a particle-number-conserving normal-ordered k-body (PNOkB) approximation of an arbitrary N-body operator is designed on the basis of Bogoliubov reference states. A numerical test based on particle-number projected Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations permits to check the particle-number conserving/violating character of a given approximation to a particle-number conserving operator. Using the presently proposed PNOkB approximation, ab initio calculations based on symmetry-breaking and restored formalisms can be safely performed.",19,[],11

Furthermore, the complex phase structure is exhibited for the pole and nonpole parts of the reaction amplitude in such a way that it will serve as a convenient common starting point for constructing models with different levels of approximation, in particular, for building isobar models where the basic properties of the equation-matrix can be maintained. Such models should be useful, especially, in coupled multichannel calculations, where a large amount of experimental data are considered in resonance analyses, a situation encountered in modern baryon spectroscopy. In particular, it is shown that the unitarity of the pole part of the equation-matrix arises automatically from the dressing mechanism inherent in the basic scattering equation.

For both distributions, we find that the results of in-out and in-in formalisms start to diverge when the electric field equation is larger than the chiral effective mass equation, that is, when the Schwinger pair production mechanism becomes important. Besides, the chiral restorations are stiffer in the in-in formalism, especially the transition shifts to first-order instead of the second-order for the PEM field.

At low temperature and finite baryon density, the model predicts a first-, second-order chiral phase transition, or a crossover, depending on the expectation value of the scalar field, and a first-order deconfinement phase transition.

1903.03875,nucl-th,"The effect of model parameters in the equation of state for quark matter on the magnitude of the maximum mass of hybrid stars is examined. Quark matter is described in terms of the extended MIT bag model including corrections for one-gluon exchange. For nucleon matter in the range of densities corresponding to the phase transition, a relativistic equation of state is used that is calculated with two particle correlations taken into account based on using the Bonn meson-exchange potential. The Maxwell construction is used to calculate the characteristics of the first order phase transition and it is shown that for a fixed value of the strong interaction constant equation, the baryon concentrations of the coexisting phases grow monotonically as the bag constant B increases. It is shown that for a fixed value of the strong interaction constant equation, the maximum mass of a hybrid star increases as the bag constant equation decreases. For a given value of the bag parameter equation, the maximum mass rises as the strong interaction constant equation increases. It is shown that the configurations of hybrid stars with maximum masses equal to or exceeding the mass of the currently known most massive pulsar are possible for values of the strong interaction constant equation and sufficiently low values of the bag constant.",19,[],11
1902.09319,nucl-th,"We present empirical evidence of isospin dependence in the compound nuclear fission cross-sections and fission widths, which suggests that the compound nucleus (CN) possibly retains the memory of the isospin when it is formed. We examine the idea, first proposed by Yadrovsky [1], for three pairs of reactions where experimental data of fission cross section at various excitation energies are available. One of the pairs of reactions is the same as used by Yadrovsky i.e. equationBi(equation, f) and equationPb(equation, f) leading to the CN equationPo but with an improved experimental data set. The other two pairs of reaction sets are, equationRe(equation, f) and equationW(equation, f) leading to the CN equationOs and, equationTl(equation, f) and equationHg(equation, f) leading to the CN equationPb. An observable difference between the fission branching ratios in two different isospin states suggests that the CN seems to remember its isospin at the point of formation. This possibility is further supported by another method, where additional empirical evidence for four CN, viz. equationPo, equationBi, equationBi, and equationHg, is obtained from the experimental data in Zhukova et al. [2]. Further, the data also suggest a possible new signature of the weakening of CN process and gradual transition to non-compound processes as the energy rises. Fresh experimental efforts as proposed, are required to confirm these findings.",19,[],11
1901.01204,nucl-th,"This work provides a brief history of determinations of the pion-nucleon (equation) coupling constant from equation and equation data. From robust analyses of twenty reported values of the charged-pion coupling constant, exhibiting sizeable fluctuation, the result equation is obtained. Similar values are extracted for the other two equation coupling constants, equation and equation, from fewer data. The average values of the various equation coupling constants, extracted in this work, suggest no splitting, in agreement with the thesis of the Nijmegen group. Additional analysis of the equation and equation values, both reported in four studies, turned to be inconclusive: one of these studies suggests that equation, whereas another slightly favours equation; no significant splitting effects are observed in the other two studies. The analysis of the low-energy equation data with the ETH model indicates significant splitting and, under certain conditions, it implies that equation. Also discussed in the paper are the electromagnetic corrections, which need to be applied to the strong shift and to the total decay width of the ground state of pionic hydrogen in order that estimates for the hadronic equation-wave equation scattering lengths be obtained; this is a relevant subject as equation may be extracted from the isovector scattering length by use of the Goldberger-Miyazawa-Oehme sum rule.

While the shell model has been predominantly used in a phenomenological context, there have been efforts stretching back over a half century to derive shell model parameters based on a realistic interaction between nucleons. More recently, several ab initio many-body methods---in particular many-body perturbation theory, the no-core shell model, the in-medium similarity renormalization group, and coupled cluster theory---have developed the capability to provide effective shell model Hamiltonians. We provide an update on the status of these methods and investigate the connections between them and potential strengths and weaknesses, with a particular focus on the in-medium similarity renormalization group approach. Three-body forces are demonstrated to be an important ingredient in understanding the modifications needed in phenomenological treatments.

1911.11892,nucl-th,We present the novel microscopic n-body dynamical transport approach PHQMD(Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular-Dynamics) for the description of particle production and cluster formation in heavy-ion reactions at relativistic energies. The PHQMD extends the established PHSD (Parton-Hadron-String-Dynamics) transport approach by replacing the mean field by density dependent two body interactions in a similar way as in the Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) models. This allows for the calculation of the time evolution of the n-body Wigner density and therefore for a dynamical description of clusters and hypernuclei formation. The clusters are identified with the MST ('Minimum Spanning Tree') or the SACA ('Simulated Annealing Cluster Algorithm') algorithm which - by regrouping the nucleons in single nucleons and noninteracting clusters - finds the most bound configuration of nucleons and clusters.

1905.11927,nucl-th,"Two fits of the pairing residual interaction in the rare-earth region are independently performed. One is made on the odd-even staggering of masses by comparing measured and explicitly calculated three-point binding-energy differences centered on odd-even nuclei. Another deals with the moments of inertia of the first 2 states of well deformed even-even nuclei upon comparing experimental data with the results of Inglis-Belyaev moments (supplemented by a crude estimate of the so-called Thouless-Valatin corrections). The sample includes 24 even-even and 31 odd-mass nuclei selected according to two criteria: they should have good rotor properties and should not correspond to low pairing-correlation regimes in their ground states. Calculations are performed in the self-consistent Hartree-Fock plus BCS framework (implementing a self-consistent blocking in the case of odd-mass nuclei). The Skyrme SIII parametrization is used in the particle-hole channel and the fitted quantities are the strengths of Tz=1 proton and neutron seniority residual interactions. As a result, the two fits yield sets of strengths in excellent agreement: about 0.1% for the neutron parameters and 0.2% for protons. In contrast when one performs such a fit on odd-even staggering from quantities deduced from BCS gaps or minimal quasiparticle energies in even-even nuclei, as is traditional, one obtains results significantly different from those obtained in the same nuclei by a fit of moments of inertia. As a conclusion, beyond providing a phenomenological tool for microscopic calculations in this region, we have illustrated the proposition made in the seminal paper of Bohr, Mottelson and Pines that moments of inertia and odd-even staggering in selected nuclei were excellent measuring sticks of nuclear pairing correlations.",19,[],11

We explore the robustness of the N=82 and N=126 magic numbers in the neutron-rich 130Cd and 206Hg nuclides, respectively. A parallel between the two nuclides in terms of the high-spin isomers allows us to investigate these waiting-point nuclei, which have limited experimental data, by using the concept of seniority as the stepping stone.

1909.04005,nucl-th,"[Background] While the tensor interaction has been shown to significantly affect the nuclear structure of exotic nuclei, its influence on nuclear reactions has only recently been investigated. The primary reason for this neglect is the fact that most studies of nuclear dynamics do not include the tensor force at all in their models. Indeed, only a few Skyrme parametrizations consider the tensor interaction in parameter determination. With modern research facilities extending our ability to probe exotic nuclei, a correct description of nuclear dynamics and heavy-ion fusion is vital to both supporting and leading experimental efforts.   [Method] Fusion cross sections are calculated using ion-ion potentials generated by the fully microscopic density-constrained time-dependent Hartree-Fock (DC-TDHF) method with the complete Skyrme tensor interaction.   [Results] For light nuclei, the tensor force only slightly changes the sub-barrier fusion cross sections at very low energies. Heavier nuclei, however, begin to exhibit a substantial hindrance effect in the sub-barrier region. This effect is strongest in spin-unsaturated systems, though can manifest in other configurations as well. Static, ground state deformation effects of the tensor force can also affect cross sections by shifting the fusion barrier.   [Conclusions] The tensor interaction has a measurable effect on the fusion cross sections of nuclei spanning the nuclear chart. The effect comes from both static effects present in the ground state and dynamic processes arising from the time evolution of the system. This motivates the development of a modern Skyrme parameter set that includes all time-odd and tensor terms and that studies moving forward should include the tensor force to ensure a more robust and complete description of nuclei.",19,[],11

These mathematical properties of the harmonic oscillator basis are especially advantageous in problems where one employs both position and momentum space.

The theoretical model uses as input spin-dependent equation amplitudes obtained from the most recent partial-wave analysis and also takes into account the deuteron equation wave and charge-exchange effects. Predictions of the refined Glauber model are compared with the existing experimental data. Reasonable agreement between the theoretical calculations and experimental data at low momentum transfers equation (GeV/equation is found for all observables considered. Moderate discrepancies found in this region are shown to be likely due to uncertainties in the input equation amplitudes. Qualitative agreement at higher momentum transfers is also found for most observables except the tensor ones with mixed equation and equation polarization components. Possible reasons for observed deviations of the model calculations from the data at equation (GeV/equation are discussed.,19,[],11
1902.06296,nucl-th,"The most extreme deformations that can be explored in heavy-ion collisions at Fermi-energies are collimated flows of nuclear matter which recall jet dynamics.   From microphysics to the cosmological scale, jets are rather common topologies.   In nuclear physics, pioneering works focused on the breakup of these structures, resulting into early nuclear-fission models in analogy to the droplet formation in viscous liquids; such view became emblematic to explain surface-energy effects and surface instability by analogy with the Rayleigh instability.   Through a dynamical approach based on the Boltzmann-Langevin equation, well adapted to out-of-equilibrium conditions, we explored the possibility that nuclear jets could arise in heavy-ion collisions from different conditions than those leading to fission or neck fragmentation, and that they can breakup from mechanisms that are almost unrelated to cohesive properties.",19,[],11

1906.02137,nucl-th,"A fully self-consistent renormalized random-phase approximation is constructed based on the self-consistent Hartree-Fock mean field plus exact pairing solutions (EP). This approach exactly conserves the particle number and restores the energy-weighted sum rule, which is violated in the conventional renormalized particle-hole random-phase approximation for a given multipolarity. The numerical calculations are carried out for several light, medium, and heavy-mass nuclei such as equationO, equationNi, and equationZr by using an effective MSk3 interaction. To study the pygmy dipole resonance (PDR), the calculations are also performed for the two light and neutron-rich equationO isotopes, whose PDRs are known to be dominant. The results obtained show that the inclusion of ground-state correlations beyond the random-phase approximation (RPA) by means of the occupation numbers obtained from the EP affects the RPA solutions within the whole mass range, although this effect decreases with increasing the mass number. At the same time, the anti-pairing effect is observed via a significant reduction of pairing in neutron-rich nuclei. The enhancement of PDR is found in most of neutron-rich nuclei under consideration within our method.",19,[],11
1907.05574,nucl-th,We propose a novel mechanism to explain nuclear decay by emission of an alpha particle. We show that the famous Geiger-Nuttall law can be explained by post-forming an alpha particle outside the range of the nuclear interaction with the daughter nucleus. This contrasts with the commonly accepted mechanism of first alpha particle pre-formation followed by emission through barrier penetration. We predict that the post-formation mechanism is more likely to occur for alpha-particles with higher energy.,19,[],11
1907.07902,nucl-th,"A new paradigm for nuclear structure that includes blocking effects of tensor interactions is proposed. All of the recently discovered magic numbers (N=6, 14, 16, 32 and 34) in neutron-rich nuclei can be explained by the blocking effects. A large amount of binding energy is gained by high-momentum correlated pairs of nucleons produced by the tensor interaction. Such tensor correlations strongly depend on the configuration space available for exciting nucleons to 2p-2h states. When additional neutrons occupy a new orbital, the previously available configuration may be lost, resulting in a sudden loss of binding energy otherwise gained by the 2p-2h excitations. Such tensor blocking effects enlarge the energy gaps at all observed new magic numbers. Tensor blocking also explains consistently the observed peculiar configurations of neutron-rich nuclei at the borders of shells.",19,[],11

To assess this situation, a large scale (24)hw shell model calculation of 16C has been made from which the wave functions have been used to obtain the B(E2) value.

Results on several stable nuclei are compared with the available experimental information. It is shown that a deformed formalism improves the agreement with experiment in deformed nuclei, while reproducing equally well spherical nuclei by taking properly the spherical limit of the deformed model and the effect of nucleon-nucleon correlations.

1904.11575,physics,"A new inversion method for determining near-surface shear currents from a measured wave spectrum is introduced. The method is straightforward to implement and starts from the existing state-of-the-art technique of assigning effective depths to measured wavenumber-dependent Doppler shift velocities. A polynomial fit is performed, with the coefficients scaled based on a simple derived relation to produce a current profile that is an improved estimate of the true profile. The method involves no user-input parameters, with the optimal parameters involved in the polynomial fit being chosen based on a simple criterion involving the measured Doppler shift data only. The method is tested on experimental data obtained from a laboratory where current profiles of variable depth dependence could be created and measured by particle image velocimetry, which served as ""truth"" measurements. Applying the new inversion method to experimentally measured Doppler shifts resulted in a equation improvement in accuracy relative to the state-of-the-art for current profiles with significant near-surface curvature. The experiments are dynamically similar to typical oceanographic flows such as wind-drift profiles and our laboratory thus makes a suitable and eminently useful scale model of the real-life setting. Our results show that the new method can achieve improved accuracy in reconstructing near-surface shear profiles from wave measurements by a simple extension of methods which are currently in use, incurring little extra complexity and effort. A novel adaptation of the normalized scalar product method has been implemented, able to extract Doppler shift velocities as a function of wavenumber from the measured wave spectrum.",19,[],5
1908.03543,physics,"Plasmon-polaritons are among the most promising candidates for next generation optical sensors due to their ability to support extremely confined electromagnetic fields and empower strong coupling of light and matter. Here we propose quantum plasmonic immunoassay sensing as an innovative scheme, which embeds immunoassay sensing with recently demonstrated room temperature strong coupling in nanoplasmonic cavities. In our protocol, the antibody-antigen-antibody complex is chemically linked with a quantum emitter label. Placing the quantum-emitter enhanced antibody-antigen-antibody complexes inside or close to a nanoplasmonic (hemisphere dimer) cavity facilitates strong coupling between the plasmon-polaritons and the emitter label resulting in signature Rabi splitting. Through rigorous statistical analysis of multiple analytes randomly distributed on the substrate in extensive realistic computational experiments, we demonstrate a drastic enhancement of the sensitivity up to nearly 1500% compared to conventional shifting-type plasmonic sensors. Most importantly and in stark contrast to classical sensing, we achieve in the strong-coupling (quantum) sensing regime an enhanced sensitivity that is no longer dependent on the concentration of antibody-antigen-antibody complexes -- down to the single-analyte limit. The quantum plasmonic immunoassay scheme thus not only leads to the development of plasmonic bio-sensing for single molecules but also opens up new pathways towards room-temperature quantum sensing enabled by biomolecular inspired protocols linked with quantum nanoplasmonics.",19,[],5
1911.04659,physics,"We study formation of the Vibrational Distribution Function (VDF) in a molecular gas at low pressure, when vibrational levels are excited by electron impact and deactivated in collisions with walls and show that this problem has a convenient analytical solution that can be used to obtain VDF and its dependence on external parameters. The VDF is determined by excitation of vibrational levels by an external source and deactivation in collisions with the wall. Deactivation in wall collisions is little known process. However, we found that the VDF is weakly dependent on the functional form of the actual form of probability gammav'->v for a vibrational number v' to transfer into a lower level v at the wall. Because for a given excitation source of vibrational states, the problem is linear the solution for VDF involves solving linear matrix equation. The matrix equation can be easily solved if we approximate probability, in the form: gammav'->v=(1/v')theta(v'->v). In this case, the steady-state solution for VDF(v) simply involves a sum of source rates for levels above , with a factor of 1/(v1). As an example of application, we study the vibrational kinetics in a hydrogen gas and verify the analytical solution by comparing with a full model.",19,[],5

This study builds on a questionnaire to survey the geothermal data management practices in mature geothermal markets. The inquiry targeted public Regulatory entities with overview of geothermal resources as well as public and private developers.

The questionnaire focused on the specifications, usage and investments required for installing/maintaining information systems capable of managing exploration data. In addition, information on the different regulatory frameworks and company policies for managing/sharing exploration data has been gathered to identify the requirements imposed on the design of information systems. The responses were analyzed to identify commonalities in data management practices. They reveal that installing an Information System (IS) is the best practice to systematically and securely manage exploration data. They also provide recommendations with respect to the regulatory framework, data types, data collection methodologies, data storage, data quality control, data accessibility and dissemination, IS architecture, financial investments and human resources required to develop a state-of-the art IS.

The heating peak corresponding to the cyclotron frequency resonance is identified to determine the magnetic field. A new method for quickly preparing low density electron plasmas for destructive temperature measurements enables a rapid and automated scan of microwave frequencies. This technique can determine the magnetic field to high precision, obtaining an absolute accuracy better than equation, and a relative precision of equation.

This study shows that with the increase in spatial correlation length, between these heterogeneous distributions of hydraulic conductivities, the anomaly of the flow reduces, yet the equation value is unchanged, suggesting that there is a topological component to the flow field, captured by the equation.

1901.03467,physics,"In Earthquake Early Warning (EEW), every sufficiently impulsive signal is potentially the first evidence for an unfolding large earthquake. More often than not, however, impulsive signals are mere nuisance signals. One of the most fundamental - and difficult - tasks in EEW is to rapidly and reliably discriminate real local earthquake signals from all other signals. This discrimination is necessarily based on very little information, typically a few seconds worth of seismic waveforms from a small number of stations. As a result, current EEW systems struggle to avoid discrimination errors, and suffer from false and missed alerts. In this study we show how modern machine learning classifiers can strongly improve real-time signal/noise discrimination. We develop and compare a series of non-linear classifiers with variable architecture depths, including fully connected, convolutional (CNN) and recurrent neural networks, and a model that combines a generative adversarial network with a random forest (GANRF). We train all classifiers on the same data set, which includes 374k local earthquake records (M3.0-9.1) and 946k impulsive noise signals. We find that all classifiers outperform existing simple linear classifiers, and that complex models trained directly on the raw signals yield the greatest degree of improvement. Using 3s long waveform snippets, the CNN and the GANRF classifiers both reach 99.5% precision and 99.3% recall on an independent validation data set. Most misclassifications stem from impulsive teleseismic records, and from incorrectly labeled records in the data set. Our results suggest that machine learning classifiers can strongly improve the reliability and speed of EEW alerts.",19,[],5
1912.09139,physics,"Metagrating is a new concept for wavefront manipulation that, unlike phase gradient metasurfaces, does not suffer from low efficiency and also has a less complicated fabrication process. In this paper, a compound metallic grating (a periodic structure with more than one slit in each period) is proposed for anomalous reflection. The electromagnetic response of this grating is analyzed by a proposed analytical method and then a closed-form and analytical expressions are presented for the reflection coefficients of the higher diffracted orders. The proposed method is verified by full-wave simulations and the results are in excellent agreement. Thanks to the geometrical asymmetry of compound metallic grating, we use it for designing anomalous reflection in the normal incident. Given analytical expressions for reflection coefficients, a perfect anomalous reflector is designed via transferring all the incident power to (-1) diffraction order. The structure designed in this study has an unprecedented near-to-unitary efficiency of 99.9%.

A total of 29 W I spectral lines are observed from the two experiments using survey spectrometers between 200-400 nm with level identifications provided based on a structure calculation for many of the excited states that produce strong emission lines. Of the 29 observed lines, 20 have not previously been reported in fusion relevant plasmas, including an intense line at 265.65 nm which could be important for benchmarking the frequently exploited line at 400.88 nm. Nearly all of the observed spectral lines decay down to one of the six lowest energy levels for neutral W, which are likely to be long-lived metastable states. The impact of metastable level populations on the W I emission spectrum and any erosion measurement utilizing a spectroscopic technique is potentially significant.

1903.00349,physics,"In this work, we study in detail the distribution of stochastic forces generated by the molecular motors activity, in the actin cortex of pre-muscular cells. By combining active and passive rheology experiments, performed on the same micro-bead bound to the actin network through membrane adhesive receptors, we measure the auto-correlation function Cff(t) of the average force pulling on the bead. Like for any out-of-equilibrium system, the force distribution differs from the thermodynamical equilibrium one, especially at long time scale t>1sec where the bead motion becomes partially directed. Thus the fluctuation-dissipation theorem does not apply and one can measure the distance from equilibrium through its violation. This work focuses on the influence of various parameters (ligand density, temperature, ATP depletion, molecular motors activity) on the force distribution. In particular, it is shown that the amplitude of active forces increases when the bead is more tighly attached to the cortex: this is interpreted through a model which takes into account the number of bonds between the bead and the cytoskeleton and the viscoelastic properties of the medium. It also increases with temperature, consistently with a description of the cell metabolism in terms of thermally activated reactions. Last, but not least, ATP depletion in the cell, or partial inhibitition of the actomyosin activity, leads to a decrease of the amplitude of the force distribution. Altogether, we propose a consistent and quantitative description for the motion of a micrometric probe interacting with the actin network, and for the amplitude of the stochastic forces generated by molecular motors in the cortex surrounding this probe.",19,[],5

1902.05419,physics,"According to Weber's electrodynamics, Assis showed analytically, that a field-free electrostatic potential delivered by a spherical shell causes a force upon a moving electrical charge in the center of that shell. This force can be interpreted as a result of the change in inertial mass of the charge. In order to prove this theory, Mikhailov published two type of experimental setups: One using vacuum cathode tube and another using glow-discharge-lamps to generate oscillating and accelerating electrons. Whereas the glow-discharge experiment was already evaluated by several groups, here we are focusing on replicating the vacuum tube configuration. Under right circumstances, electrons inside a vacuum tube start to oscillate around a grid electrode, which is called Barkhausen-Kurz oscillations. However, we found that Mikhailov's setup does not produce these kind of oscillations and therefore the theory that he applied in the interpretation of his measurements is not correct. We succeeded in generating Barkhausen-Kurz oscillations with a different vacuum tube and found no frequency shifts below an order of magnitude of Assis's prediction by operating the tube inside a charged spherical shell that would indicate a change in the electron's mass.

We show that while the absorbance and morphology of the layers remains largely unaffected, the surface composition and energetics, crystallinity, emission efficiency, energetic disorder and storage stability are all very sensitive to the precise stoichiometry of the precursor solution. Our results elucidate the origin of the irreproducibility and inconsistencies of reported results among different groups as well as the wide spread in device performance even within individual studies.

Laser Doppler Vibrometry based schemes (LDV) offer such an advantage. However, the measurements are limited up to equation, where equation is the wavelength of optical source. An experimental design of high resolution non-intrusive displacement sensor working on the principle of basic LDV is being presented here. Resolution enhancement has been achieved through phase multiplication using multiple reflections within a high-Q cavity created by a vibrating surface and a high reflection mirror kept parallel to each other. Displacement of 72 equation has been measured with an error range of equation equation through direct counting of characteristic peaks in ""half cycle"" of the interferogram. The experimental design offers a straightforward route to measure displacement and the measurement resolution is mainly limited by the reflectivity and physical dimension of moving source.",19,[],5
1907.08701,physics,"The hydroxyl radical, OH, is an important component of many natural and technological plasmas but there is little available information on processes involving its collisions with low-energy electrons. Low-energy electron collisions with OH are studied in the framework of the R-matrix method. Potential energy curves of some of the low lying target states of doublet and quartet symmetry which go to the O(3P)H(2S), O(1D)H(2S) and O(1S)H(2S) asymptotic limits are obtained for inter nuclear separations between 1 - 6 a0.

1905.02614,physics,"Positive streamer discharges require a source of free electrons ahead of them for their growth. In air, these electrons are typically provided by photoionization. Here we investigate how stochastic fluctuations due to the discreteness of ionizing photons affect positive streamers in air. We simulate positive streamers between two planar electrodes with a 3D plasma fluid model, using both a stochastic and a continuum method for photoionization. With stochastic photoionization, fluctuations are visible in the streamer's direction, maximal electric field, velocity, and electron density. The streamers do not branch, and we find good agreement between the averaged stochastic results and the results with continuum photoionization. The streamers stay roughly axisymmetric, and we show that results obtained with an axisymmetric model indeed agree well with the 3D results. However, we find that positive streamers are sensitive to the amount of photoionization. When the amount of photoionization is doubled, there is even better agreement between the stochastic and continuum results, but with half the amount of photoionization, stochastic fluctuations become more important and streamer branching starts to occur.",19,[],5

We explore for the first time the differential extinction of forbidden molecular overtone transitions coupled to the localized surface plasmons. We show that a non-trivial interplay between the molecular absorption enhancement and suppression of plasmonic absorption in a coupled system gives rise to orders of magnitude enhancement of the probe molecule differential extinction.

SU-8 polymer posts, which significantly reduced the conduction less than 6% of the total heat transfer due to its low thermal conductivity, were carefully fabricated with different heights to directly create vacuum gaps from 507 nm down to 190 nm precisely determined in-situ by capacitance measurement. Experimental results were validated by theoretical calculations based on fluctuational electrodynamics, which revealed the enhancement mechanism mainly as coupled surface plasmon polariton.

1907.06446,physics,"A zero-frequency seismic metamaterial (ZFSM) consisting of a three-component seismic metamaterial plate and a half space is proposed to attenuate ultra-low frequency seismic surface waves. The design concept and models are verified firstly by lab-scale experiments on the seismic metamaterial consisting of a two-component seismic metamaterial plate and a half space. Then we calculate the band structures of the one-dimensional and two-dimensional ZFSMs, and evaluate their attenuation ability to Rayleigh waves. A wide band gap and a zero-frequency band gap (ZFBG) can be found as the band structure of the seismic metamaterial is almost equal to the band structure of the seismic metamaterial plate plus the sound cone. It is found that the Rayleigh waves in the ZFSM are deflected and converted into bulk waves. When the number of the unit cells of the ZFSM is sufficient, the transmission distance and deflection angle of the Rayleigh waves in the ZFSM are constant at the same frequency.

1910.00841,physics,"We report on experimental and theoretical demonstration of an optical comb spectrum based on a combination of cascaded stimulated Raman scattering and four-wave mixing mediated by Raman-induced nonresonant Kerr-type nonlinearity. This combination enabled to transform a conventional quasi-periodic Raman comb into a comb with a single and smaller frequency spacing. This new phenomenon is realized using a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber filled with 40 bars of deuterium, and pumped with a high-power picosecond laser. The resultant comb shows more than 100 spectral lines spanning over 220 THz from 800 nm to 1710 nm, with a total output power of 7.1 W. In contrast to a pure Raman comb, a 120 THz wide portion of the spectrum exhibits denser and equally-spaced spectral lines with a frequency spacing of around 1.75 THz, which is much smaller than the lowest frequency of the three excited deuterium Raman resonances. A numerical solution of the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation in the slowly varying envelope approximation provides very good agreement with the experimental data. The additional sidebands are explained by cascaded four-wave mixing between pre-existing spectral lines, mediated by the large Raman induced optical nonlinearity. The results open a new route to the generation of optical frequency combs that combine large bandwidth and high power controllable frequency spacing.",19,[],5

As a result, simultaneous detonation of higher number of mining faces does not always correlate with improvement of the effectiveness of rockburst prevention.

1901.06777,physics,"Multiscale modeling is a systematic approach to describe the behavior of complex systems by coupling models from different scales. The approach has been demonstrated to be very effective in areas of science as diverse as materials science, climate modeling and chemistry. However, routine use of multiscale simulations is often hindered by the very high cost of individual at-scale models. Approaches aiming to alleviate that cost by means of Gaussian process regression based surrogate models have been proposed. Yet, many of these surrogate models are expensive to construct, especially when the number of data needed is large. In this article, we employ a hierarchical sparse Cholesky decomposition to develop a sparse Gaussian process regression method and apply the method to approximate the equation of state of an energetic material in a multiscale model of dynamic deformation. We demonstrate that the method provides a substantial reduction both in computational cost and solution error as compared with previous methods.",19,[],5

In the present work, we study the MoS2 transistor based on a novel tri-gate device architecture, with dual-gate (Dual-G) in the channel and the buried side-gate (Side-G) for the source/drain regions. All gates can be independently controlled without interference. For a MoS2 sheet with a thickness of 3.6 nm, the Schottky barrier (SB) and non-overlapped channel region can be effectively tuned by electrostatically doping the source/drain regions with Side-G. Thus, the extrinsic resistance can be effectively lowered, and a boost of the ON-state current can be achieved. Meanwhile, the channel control remains efficient under the Dual-G mode, with an ON-OFF current ratio of 3E7 and subthreshold swing of 83 mV/decade.

The same optoelectronic properties that make perovskites ideal absorber materials in solar cells are also beneficial in other light-harvesting applications and make them prime candidates as triplet sensitizers in upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in rubrene. In this contribution, we take advantage of long carrier lifetimes and carrier diffusion lengths in perovskite thin films, their high absorption cross sections throughout the visible spectrum, as well as the strong spin-orbit coupling owing to the abundance of heavy atoms to sensitize the upconverter rubrene. Employing bulk perovskite thin films as the absorber layer and spin-mixer in inorganic/organic heterojunction upconversion devices allows us to forego the additional tunneling barrier owing from the passivating ligands required for colloidal sensitizers.

1902.04946,physics,"Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of a recently proposed method for characterizing tear film dynamics using non-invasive high speed videokeratoscopy in assessing the loss of homeostasis of tear film. Methods: Thirty subjects, from a retrospective study, of which 11 were classified as dry eye and 19 as normal, were included. High speed videokeratoscopy measurements were performed using E300 videokeratoscope (Medmont Pty., Ltd, Melbourne, Australia). Raw data was analyzed using a recently proposed method to estimate the dynamics of the tear film, based on a fractal dimension approach. This method provides three time-varying indicators related to the regularity of the reflected rings: Tear Film Surface Quality (TFSQ) indicator, Breaks Feature Indicator (BFI) and Distortions Feature Indicator (DFI). From each indicator five parameters were extracted and analyzed, including non-invasive break up time, mean value of the indicator in the stability phase, mean value of the indicator in the whole inter blink interval, mean value of the indicator in the levelling phase and the general trend of the time series. Receiver Operating Characteristic were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of each parameter in dry eye detection. Results: The best discrimination performance between dry eye and normal subjects was achieved with the BFI non-invasive break up time parameter, with an area under the curve of 0.85. For a cut off value of 10 s the sensitivity was 100% and the specificity 84%.

1904.01107,physics,"Porous silica materials offer wide range of possibilities for enhancement of the productivity of oil reservoirs. However the mechanism of adsorption of polar components of crude oil on silica surface is poorly understood that hinders technological improvement of supports and oil extraction. We have synthesized opal films with the silica microspheres size of about 360 nm, specific surface area of 5.2 m2/g and pore size of 230 nm. We have fractionated and characterized oil and oil asphaltenes from heavy (Ashalchinskoe) oil. By pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and double electron nuclear resonance (ENDOR) in the W band frequency range (microwave frequency of 94 GHz, magnetic field of 3.4 T) we have studied the adsorption of oil asphaltenes on the surface of opal samples using the intrinsic for asphaltenes paramagnetic vanadylporphyrins (VO) complexes. 1H ENDOR spectra are found to be different for initial and the adsorbed samples in their central parts (that is a sign of asphaltenes VO disaggregation) whereas no significant changes in the W band EPR spectra were detected. Contrasting to alumina support, no strong electron proton interaction with the protons on the surface of SiO2 (presumably, silanol groups) was found and infiltration of the oiled opal films with gasoline changes the central part of 1H ENDOR spectra. It shows that the proton containing groups on the surface of amorphous SiO2 sample can significantly change the asphaltene adsorption properties and ENDOR of the intrinsic for oil paramagnetic centers could be used for the characterization of surface state in porous media in situ or operando.",19,[],5

Such an inverted ladder-type scheme is predicted to be without sub-Doppler electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) feature in a thermal ensemble under the weak-probe approximation. Instead, we utilized a strong probe field and successfully observed a transparency window with a width narrower than 50~MHz. Our all-order numerical simulation is in satisfactory agreement with the experimental results. This narrow linewidth allows us to measure the energy levels of the Rydberg levels from equation=20-70 with improved accuracy. The deduced ionization energy agrees with the previous measurements. Furthermore, the two-photon Rydberg excitation scheme was applied to the cold ensembles to study the ground-state atoms population decrease in the MOT for various Rydberg states. Our experimental observations suggested two distinct regimes of the trap losses under different probe detuning conditions. While the far off-resonance case (letter p>>0) can be described by the picture of dressed atom, the on-resonance case (letter p~0) reveals more interesting results. The higher Rydberg states suffer larger trap loss. Besides, even with similar level energies, the excitation to nD states result in faster escape of the ground-state atom from trap than nearby nS states.",19,[],5

In addition, the wave function also satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation, which arises as the quantum counterpart of the constraint among particles' momenta. Comparison of the novel approach with the usual one in which matter is represented by scalar fields is performed, and shown that those approaches do not exclude, but complement each other. In final discussion it is pointed out that the classical matter could consist of superparticles or spinning particles, described by the commuting and anticommuting Grassmann coordinates, in which case spinor fields would occur after quantization.",19,[],5
1910.04913,physics,"Tailoring thermal properties with nanostructured materials can be of vital importance for many applications. Generally classical phonon size effects are employed to reduce the thermal conductivity, where strong phonon scattering by nanostructured interfaces or boundaries can dramatically supress the heat conduction. When these boundaries or interfaces are arranged in a periodic pattern, coherent phonons may have interference and modify the phonon dispersion, leading to dramatically reduced thermal conductivity. Such coherent phonon transport has been widely studied for superlattice films and recently emphasized for periodic nanoporous patterns. Although the wave effects have been proposed for reducing the thermal conductivity, more recent experimental evidence shows that such effects can only be critical at an ultralow temperature, i.e., around 10 K or below. At room temperature, the impacted phonons are mostly restricted to hypersonic modes that contribute little to the thermal conductivity. In this review, the theoretical and experimental studies of periodic porous structures are summarized and compared.

Two-dimensional volume-averaged simulations of cell voltage and zinc electrode morphology during discharge agree with these measurements.

1902.10524,physics,"Equations of cosmic dynamics for a model of the opaque Universe are derived and tested on supernovae (SNe) Ia observations. The model predicts a cyclic expansion/contraction evolution of the Universe within a limited range of scale factors. The maximum scale factor is controlled by the overcritical density of the Universe, the minimum scale factor depends on global stellar and dust masses in the Universe. During contraction due to gravitational forces, the extragalactic background light (EBL) and intergalactic opacity increase with time because of a smaller proper volume of the Universe. The radiation pressure produced by absorption of the EBL by dust steeply rises and counterbalances the gravitational forces. The maximum redshift, at which the radiation pressure is capable to stop the contraction and start a new expansion, is between 15 and 45. The model avoids the Big Bang and concepts of the non-baryonic dark matter and dark energy. The model successfully explains the existence of very old mature galaxies at high redshifts and observed dimming of the luminosity of SNe Ia with redshift. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is interpreted as thermal radiation of intergalactic dust and its temperature is predicted with accuracy higher than 2%. The CMB temperature anisotropies are caused by the EBL fluctuations related to large-scale structures in the Universe.

1907.08062,physics,"Null and X-points are not themselves directly important to magnetic reconnection because distinguishable field lines do not approach them closely. Even in a collision-free plasma, magnetic field lines that approach each other on a scale equation become indistinguishable during an evolution. What is important is the different regions of space that can be explored by magnetic field lines that pass in the vicinity of null and X-points. Traditional reconnection theories made the assumption that the reconnected magnetic flux must be dissipated or diffused by an electric field. This assumption is false in three dimensional systems because an ideal evolution can cause magnetic field lines that cover a large volume to approach each other within the indistinguishability scale equation.

Upon release from rest on a smooth wall, each sphere typically accelerated strongly over a streamwise distance of one boundary layer thickness before approaching an approximate terminal velocity. Spheres with sufficient net upward force lifted off of the wall once released before descending back towards the wall. These spheres mostly translated with the fluid above the wall, undergoing saltation or resuspension, with minimal rotation about all axes. By contrast, spheres that did not lift off after release mainly slid along the wall. As they propagated downstream, they began to roll forward with occasional lift-off events of smaller magnitude. All of the lift-off activities observed were limited to the buffer and logarithmic layers. Both translation and rotation of the spheres were significantly affected by the wall turbulence.",19,[],5

The setup is located at the Tubingen Shallow Underground Laboratory, which provides a vertical shielding depth of (13.2\,equation\,0.8) meter water equivalent at the setup location. Muon-induced neutrons are identified by the detection of 2.2\,MeV gammas from their capture on hydrogen with high-purity germanium detectors.

Up to now the physical mechanism for the drastic jet thinning is not fully understood, since in the existing literature the numerically computed/predicted fiber thickness differs several orders of magnitude from those experimentally measured. Recent works suggest that this discrepancy might arise from the neglect of the turbulent aerodynamic fluctuations in the simulations. In this paper we confirm this suggestion numerically. Due to the complexity of the process direct numerical simulations of the multiscale-multiphase problem are not possible. Hence, we develop a numerical framework for a growing fiber in turbulent air that makes the simulation of industrial setups feasible. For this purpose we employ an asymptotic viscoelastic model for the fiber. The turbulent effects are taken into account by a stochastic aerodynamic force model where the underlying velocity fluctuations are reconstructed from a equation-equation turbulence description of the airflow. Our numerical results show the significance of the turbulence on the jet thinning and give fiber diameters of realistic order of magnitude.",19,[],5
1903.06885,physics,"We study symplectic numerical integration of mechanical systems with a Hamiltonian specified in non-canonical coordinates and its application to guiding-center motion of charged plasma particles in magnetic confinement devices. The technique combines time-stepping in canonical coordinates with quadrature in non-canonical coordinates and is applicable in systems where a global transformation to canonical coordinates is known but its inverse is not. A fully implicit class of symplectic Runge-Kutta schemes has recently been introduced and applied to guiding-center motion by [Zhang et al., Phys. Plasmas 21, 32504 (2014)]. Here a generalization of this approach with emphasis on semi-implicit partitioned schemes is described together with methods to enhance their performance, in particular avoiding evaluation of non-canonical variables at full time steps. For application in toroidal plasma confinement configurations with nested magnetic flux surfaces a global canonicalization of coordinates for the guiding-center Lagrangian by a spatial transform is presented that allows for pre-computation of the required map in a parallel algorithm in the case of time-independent magnetic field geometry. Guiding-center orbits are studied in stationary magnetic equilibrium fields of an axisymmetric tokamak and a realistic three-dimensional stellarator configuration. Superior long-term properties of symplectic methods are demonstrated in comparison to a conventional adaptive Runge-Kutta scheme. Finally statistics of fast fusion alpha particle losses over their slowing-down time are computed in the stellarator field on a representative sample, reaching a speed-up of the symplectic Euler scheme by more than a factor three compared to usual Runge-Kutta schemes while keeping the same statistical accuracy and linear scaling with the number of computing threads.",19,[],5
1910.04430,physics,"An arrangement based on a degenerate cavity laser for forming an array of non-linearly coupled lasers with an intra-cavity saturable absorber is presented. More than equation lasers were spatially phase locked and temporally Q-switched. The arrangement with nonlinear coupling was found to be equation times more sensitive to loss differences and converged equation times faster to the lowest loss phase locked state than with linear coupling, thus providing a unique solution to problems that have several near-degenerate solutions.",19,[],5
1912.01386,physics,"We report a detailed experimental characterization of the periodic bubbling regimes that take place in an axisymmetric air-water jet when the inner air stream is forced by periodic modulations of the pressure at the upstream air feeding chamber. When the forcing pressure amplitude is larger than a certain critical value, the bubble formation process is effectively driven by the selected frequency, leading to the formation of nearly monodisperse bubbles whose volume is reduced by increasing the forcing frequency. We reveal the existence of two different breakup modes, M1 and M2, under effective forcing conditions. The bubble formation in mode M1 resembles the natural bubbling process, featuring an initial radial expansion of an air ligament attached to the injector, whose initial length is smaller than the wavelength of a small interfacial perturbation induced by the oscillating air flow rate. The expansion stage is followed by a ligament collapse stage, which begins with the formation of an incipient neck that propagates downstream while collapsing radially inwards, leading to the pinch-off of a new bubble. These two stages take place faster than in the unforced case as a consequence of the the air flow modulation induced by the forcing system. The breakup mode M2 takes place with an intact ligament longer than one disturbance wavelength, whereby the interface already presents a local necking region at pinch-off, and leads to the formation of bubbles from the tip of an elongated air filament without an expansion stage. Scaling laws that provide closed expressions for the bubble volume, the intact ligament length, and the transition from the M1 breakup mode to the M2, as functions of the relevant governing parameters, are deduced from the experimental data.",19,[],5
1910.07257,physics,"In this work we present a detailed analysis of individual loss mechanisms in silicon nitride partial Euler bends at a wavelength of 850 nm. This structure optimizes the transmission through small radii optical waveguide bends. The partial Euler bend geometry balances losses arising from the transition from the straight to the bend waveguide mode, and radiative losses of the bend waveguide mode. Numerical analyses are presented for 45-degree bends commonly employed in S-bend configurations to create lateral offsets, as well as 90- and 180-degree bends. Additionally, 90-degree partial Euler bends were fabricated on a silicon nitride photonic platform to experimentally complement the theoretical findings. The optimized waveguide bends allow for a reduced effective radius without increasing the total bend loss and, thus, enable a higher component density in photonic integrated circuits.",19,[],5
1905.05819,physics,"Focusing control of ultrashort pulsed beams is an important research topic, due to its impact to subsequent interaction with matter. In this work, we study the propagation near the focus of ultrashort laser pulses of ~25 fs duration under diffractive focusing. We perform the spatio-spectral and spatio-temporal measurements of their amplitude and phase, complemented by the corresponding simulations. With them, we demonstrate that pulse shaping allows modifying in a controlled way not only the spatio-temporal distribution of the light irradiance in the focal region, but also the way it propagates as well as the frequency distribution within the pulse (temporal chirp). To gain a further intuitive insight, the role of diverse added spectral phase components is analyzed, showing the symmetries that arise for each case. In particular, we compare the effects, similarities and differences of the second and third order dispersion cases.",19,[],5
1906.00152,physics,"Enhancement of thermal conductivity via surface electromagnetic waves (SEWs) supported in nanostructures has recently drawn attention as a remedy for issues raised due to the reduction of thermal conductivity in nanoscale confinement. Among them, multilayered structures on a substrate are prevalent in nano-sized systems, such as electronic nanodevices, meaning that analysis on those structures is indispensable. In this work, three basic multilayered structures are selected and the analytical expressions for SEWs supported in each structure are derived. This analytical approach enables us to figure out which factors are crucial for enhancing SEW thermal conductivity using multilayers. It is also found that the solution can be extended to various materials and provide the guidelines on which configurations are desirable for increasing the thermal conductivity. Furthermore, the analytical solutions reduce the calculation time significantly such that the optimal configuration, which can additionally yield SEW thermal conductivity of 1.27 W/mequationK corresponding to 90\% of the thermal conductivity of bulk glass, is found with the genetic algorithm. This study thus provides a new method for efficiently managing thermal issues in nano-sized devices.",19,[],5
1902.09929,physics,"We perform direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of emulsions in homogeneous, isotropic turbulence using a pseudopotential lattice-Boltzmann (PP-LB) method. Improving on previous literature by minimizing droplet dissolution and spurious currents, we show that the PP-LB technique is capable of long, stable simulations in certain parameter regions. Varying the dispersed phase volume fraction equation, we demonstrate that droplet breakup extracts kinetic energy from the larger scales while injecting energy into the smaller scales, increasingly with higher equation, with the Hinze scale dividing the two effects. Droplet size (equation) distribution was found to follow the equation scaling (Deane & Stokes 2002). We show the need to maintain a separation of the turbulence forcing scale and domain size to prevent the formation of large connected regions of the dispersed phase. For the first time, we show that turbulent emulsions evolve into a quasi-equilibrium cycle of alternating coalescence and breakup dominated processes. Studying the system in its state-space comprising kinetic energy equation, enstrophy equation and the droplet number density equation, we find that their dynamics resemble limit-cycles with a time delay. Extreme values in the evolution of equation manifest in the evolution of equation and equation with a delay of equation and equation respectively (with equation the large eddy timescale). Lastly, we also show that flow topology of turbulence in an emulsion is significantly more different than single-phase turbulence than previously thought. In particular, vortex compression and axial straining mechanisms become dominant in the droplet phase, a consequence of the elastic behaviour of droplet interfaces.

1911.00939,physics,"We study the propagation in three dimensions of internal waves using ray tracing methods and traditional dynamical systems theory. The wave propagation on a cone that generalizes the Saint Andrew's cross justifies the introduction of an angle of propagation that allows to describe the position of the wave ray in the horizontal plane. Considering the evolution of this reflection angle for waves that repeatedly reflect off an inclined slope, a new trapping mechanism emerges that displays the tendency to align this angle with the upslope gradient. In the rather simple geometry of a translationally invariant canal, we show first that this configuration leads to trapezium-shaped attractors, very similar to what has been extensively studied in two-dimensions. However, we also establish a direct link between the trapping and the existence of two-dimensional attractors. In a second stage, considering a geometry that is not translationally invariant, closer to realistic configurations, we prove that although there are no two-dimensional attractors, one can find a structure in three-dimensional space with properties similar to internal wave attractors: a one-dimensional attracting manifold. Moreover, as this structure is unique, it should be easy to visualize in laboratory experiments since energy injected in the domain would eventually be confined to a very thin region in three-dimensional space, for which reason it is called a super-attractor.",19,[],5

However, collisions between trapped, naturally occurring molecules have so far eluded direct observation due to the low collision rates of dilute samples. We report the first directly observed collisions between cold, trapped molecules, achieved without the need of laser cooling. We magnetically capture molecular oxygen in a 0.8K x kB deep superconducting trap, and set bounds on the ratio between the elastic and inelastic scattering rates, the key parameter determining the feasibility of evaporative cooling.

1907.03489,physics,"Usage of double-layer targets consisting of heavy and light material with modulated interface between them provides a way for laser-driven generation of collimated ion beams. With extensive 2D3V PIC simulations we show that this configuration may result in a development of a relativistic instability with Rayleigh-Taylor and Richtmyer-Meshkov like features. Initially small perturbations are amplified during the laser-target interaction leading to the formation of low-density plasma regions and high-density bunches between them, which are accelerated by the laser radiation pressure as whole compact structures. That results in collimated quasi-monoenergetic proton beam with high average energy. The properties of this proton beam such as its low emittance (one order of magnitude lower compared to that of conventional accelerators) and divergence are discussed. Results are compared with similar acceleration schemes such as double-layer target without corrugation and single-layer target.",19,[],5
1902.04325,physics,"We here propose a model to capture the complexity of the streamer corona adjacent to leader stepping and relate it to the production of energetic electrons serving as a source of X-rays and equation-rays, manifesting in terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs). During its stepping, the leader tip is accompanied by a corona consisting of multitudinous streamers perturbing the air in its vicinity and leaving residual charge behind. We explore the relative importance of air perturbations and preionization on the production of energetic run-away electrons by 2.5D cylindrical Monte Carlo particle simulations of streamers in ambient fields of 16 kV cmequation and 50 kV cmequation at ground pressure. We explore preionization levels between equation mequation and equation mequation, channel widths between 0.5 and 1.5 times the original streamer widths and air perturbation levels between 0\% and 50\% of ambient air. We observe that streamers in preionized and perturbed air accelerate more efficiently than in non-ionized and uniform air with air perturbation dominating the streamer acceleration. We find that in unperturbed air preionization levels of equation mequation are sufficient to explain run-away electron rates measured in conjunction with terrestrial gamma-ray flashes. In perturbed air, the production rate of runaway electrons varies from equation sequation to equation sequation with maximum electron energies from some hundreds of eV up to some hundreds of keV in fields above and below the breakdown strength. In the presented simulations the number of runaway electrons matches with the number of energetic electrons measured in alignment with the observations of terrestrial gamma-ray flashes. Conclusively, the complexity of the streamer zone ahead of leader tips allows explaining the emission of energetic electrons and photons from streamer discharges.",19,[],5

To simplify the circuit structure of the readout electronics, a front end ASIC was designed. Based on the charge-to-time conversion method, the output pulse width of the ASIC corresponds to the input signal charge information while time information of the input signal is picked off through a discriminator, and thus the time and charge information can be digitized simultaneously using this ASIC and a following Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC). To address the challenge of mismatch among the channels observed in the previous prototype version, this work presents approaches for analyzing the problem and optimizing the circuits. A new version of the ASIC was designed and fabricated in the GLOBALFOUNDRIES 0.35 um CMOS technology, which integrates 6 channels (corresponding to the readout of the 3 PMTs) in each chip. The test results indicate that the mismatch between the channels is significantly reduced to less than 20% using the proposed approach.

1909.07941,physics,"Metamaterials and metasurfaces are widely used to manipulate electromagnetic waves over a broad range of wavelengths. Several recent efforts have focused on metalenses, ultra-thin optical elements that focus light using subwavelength structures. Compared to their refractive counterparts, metalenses offer reduced size and weight, improved manufacturability, and new functionality such as polarization control. However, metalenses that correct chromatic aberration also suffer from markedly reduced focusing efficiency. Here we introduce a Hybrid Achromatic Metalens (HAML), that overcomes this trade-off and offers improved focusing efficiency over a broad wavelength range from 1000 - 1800 nm. Fabricated HAMLs demonstrated diffraction limited performance for numerical apertures (NA) of 0.27, 0.11, and 0.06 with average focusing efficiencies equation and maximum efficiencies ~ equation.

1908.02889,q-bio,"Atherosclerosis is characterised by the growth of fatty plaques in the inner (intimal) layer of the artery wall. In mature plaques, vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are recruited from the adjacent medial layer to deposit a cap of fibrous collagen over the fatty plaque core. The fibrous cap isolates the thrombogenic content of the plaque from the bloodstream and prevents the formation of blood clots that cause myocardial infarction or stroke. Despite the important protective role of the cap, the mechanisms that regulate cap formation and maintenance are not well understood. It remains unclear why certain caps become stable, while others become vulnerable to rupture. We develop a multiphase PDE model with non-standard boundary conditions to investigate collagen cap formation by SMCs in response to growth factor signals from the endothelium. Diffusible platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates SMC migration, proliferation and collagen degradation, while diffusible transforming growth factor (TGF)-equation stimulates SMC collagen synthesis and inhibits collagen degradation. The model SMCs respond haptotactically to gradients in the collagen phase and have reduced rates of migration and proliferation in dense collagenous tissue. The model, which is parameterised using a range of in vivo and in vitro experimental data, reproduces several observations from studies of plaque growth in atherosclerosis-prone mice. Numerical simulations and model analysis demonstrate that a stable cap can be formed by a relatively small SMC population and emphasise the critical role of TGF-equation in effective cap formation and maintenance. These findings provide unique insight into the cellular and biochemical mechanisms that may lead to plaque destabilisation and rupture. This work represents an important step towards the development of a comprehensive in silico plaque.",19,[],10
1909.03139,q-bio,"Preferred walking speed is a widely-used performance measure for people with mobility issues, but is usually measured in straight line walking for fixed distances or durations. However, daily walking involves walking for bouts of different distances and walking with turning. Here, we studied walking for short distances and walking in circles in unilateral lower-limb amputees wearing an above or below-knee passive prosthesis, specifically, a Jaipur foot prosthesis. Analogous to earlier results in non-amputees, we found that their preferred walking speeds are lower for short distances and lower for circles of smaller radii. Using inverse optimization, we estimated the cost of changing speeds and turning such that the observed preferred walking speeds in our experiments minimizes the total energy cost. The inferred costs of changing speeds and turning were much larger than for non-amputees. These findings could inform prosthesis design and rehabilitation therapy to better assist changing speeds and turning tasks in amputee walking. Further, measuring the preferred speed for a range of distances and radii is a more robust subject-specific measure of walking performance.",19,[],10
1903.04907,q-bio,"Fontan patients often develop circulatory failure and are in desperate need of a therapeutic solution. A blood pump surgically placed in the cavopulmonary pathway can substitute the function of the absent sub-pulmonary ventricle by generating a mild pressure boost. However, there is currently no commercially available device designed for the cavopulmonary application; and the risks and benefits of implanting a ventricular assist device (VAD) originally designed for the left ventricular application on the right circulation of failing Fontan patients is not yet clear. Moreover, further research is needed to compare the hemodynamics between the two clinically-considered surgical configurations (Full Support and IVC Support) for cavopulmonary assist, with Full and IVC Support corresponding to the entire venous return or only the inferior venous return, respectively, being routed through the VAD. In this study, we used a numerical model of the failing Fontan physiology to evaluate the Fontan hemodynamic response to a left VAD during the IVC and Full supports. We observed that during the Full support the VAD improved the cardiac output while maintaining blood pressures within safe ranges, and lowered the IVC pressure to <15mmHg; however, we found a potential risk of lung damage at higher pump speeds due to the excessive pulmonary pressure elevation. IVC support the other hand, did not benefit the hemodynamics of the example failing Fontan patients, resulting in the superior vena cava pressure increasing to an unsafe level of >20 mmHg. The findings in this study may be helpful to surgeons for recognizing the risks of a cavopulmonary VAD and developing coherent clinical strategies for the implementation of cavopulmonary support.",19,[],10

This decomposition provides a description of small things; e.g., quantum mechanics - via the Schrodinger equation, ensembles of small things - via statistical mechanics and related fluctuation theorems, through to big things - via classical mechanics. These descriptions are complemented with a Bayesian mechanics for autonomous or active things. Although this work provides a formulation of every thing, its main contribution is to examine the implications of Markov blankets for self-organisation to nonequilibrium steady-state. In brief, we recover an information geometry and accompanying free energy principle that allows one to interpret the internal states of something as representing or making inferences about its external states. The ensuing Bayesian mechanics is compatible with quantum, statistical and classical mechanics and may offer a formal description of lifelike particles.",19,[],10
1903.04332,q-bio,"The evolution of dispersal rate is studied with a model of several local populations linked by dispersal. Three dispersal strategies are considered where all, half, or none of the offspring disperse. The spatial scale (number of patches) and the temporal scale (probability of local extinction) of the environment are critical in determining the selective advantage of the different dispersal strategies. The results from the simulations suggest that an interaction between group selection and individual selection results in a different outcome in relation to the spatial and temporal scales of the environment. Such an interaction is able to maintain a polymorphism in dispersal strategies. The maintenance of this polymorphism is also scale-dependent. This study suggests a mechanism for the short-term evolution of dispersal, and provides a testable prediction of this hypothesis, namely that loss of dispersal abilities should be more frequent in spatially more continuous environments, or in temporally more stable environments.",19,[],10

Furthermore, osmotic fragility of PQ carrier erythrocytes was increased in comparison with unloaded cells. Electron microscopy revealed spherocyte formation with PQ carrier erythrocytes. PQ-loaded cells showed sustained drug release over a 48 h period. Erythrocytes were loaded with PQ successfully, but there were some biochemical as well as physiological changes that resulted from the effect of PQ on the oxidative status of drug-loaded erythrocytes.

BTA estimates were K = 0.12 y-1 (95% CI: 0.024 to 0.26 y-1), Linf = 118 mm (95% CI: 81 to 363 mm), Phi' = 1.23 log10(cm y-1) (95% CI: 0.86 to 1.36 log10(cm y-1)).

1910.02293,q-bio,"The commonly observed negative correlation between the number of species in an ecological community and disease risk, typically referred to as ""the dilution effect"", has received a substantial amount of attention over the past decade. Attempts to test this relationship experimentally have revealed that, in addition to the mean disease risk decreasing with species number, so too does the variance of disease risk. This is referred to as the ""variance reduction effect"", and has received relatively little attention in the disease-diversity literature. Here, we set out to clarify and quantify some of these relationships in an idealized model of a randomly assembled multi-species community undergoing an epidemic. We specifically investigate the variance of the community disease reproductive ratio, a multi-species extension of the basic reproductive ratio R0, for a family of random-parameter meta-community SIR models, and show how the variance of community equation varies depending on whether transmission is density or frequency-dependent. We finally outline areas of further research on how changes in variance affect transmission dynamics in other systems.",19,[],10
1909.04400,q-bio,"Prediction in language has traditionally been studied using simple designs in which neural responses to expected and unexpected words are compared in a categorical fashion. However, these designs have been contested as being `prediction encouraging', potentially exaggerating the importance of prediction in language understanding. A few recent studies have begun to address these worries by using model-based approaches to probe the effects of linguistic predictability in naturalistic stimuli (e.g. continuous narrative). However, these studies so far only looked at very local forms of prediction, using models that take no more than the prior two words into account when computing a word's predictability. Here, we extend this approach using a state-of-the-art neural language model that can take roughly 500 times longer linguistic contexts into account. Predictability estimates from the neural network offer a much better fit to EEG data from subjects listening to naturalistic narrative than simpler models, and reveal strong surprise responses akin to the P200 and N400. These results show that predictability effects in language are not a side-effect of simple designs, and demonstrate the practical use of recent advances in AI for the cognitive neuroscience of language.",19,[],10
1910.09510,q-bio,"During the last two decades, ecological speciation has been a major research theme in evolutionary biology. Ecological speciation occurs when reproductive isolation between populations evolves as a result of niche differentiation. Phytophagous insects represent model systems for the study of this evolutionary process. The host-plants on which these insects feed and often spend parts of their life cycle constitute ideal agents of divergent selection for these organisms. Adaptation to feeding on different host-plant species can potentially lead to ecological specialization of populations and subsequent speciation. This process is thought to have given birth to the astonishing diversity of phytophagous insects and is often put forward in macroevolutionary scenarios of insect diversification. Consequently, numerous phylogenetic studies on phytophagous insects have aimed at testing whether speciation driven by host-plant adaptation is the main pathway for the diversification of the groups under investigation. The increasing availability of comprehensive and well-resolved phylogenies and the recent developments in phylogenetic comparative methods are offering an unprecedented opportunity to test hypotheses on insect diversification at a macroevolutionary scale, in a robust phylogenetic framework. Our purpose here is to review the contribution of phylogenetic analyses to investigate the importance of plant-mediated speciation in the diversification of phytophagous insects and to present suggestions for future developments in this field.",19,[],10

An implementation of the cortical magnification function is included to define the retinotopical projections towards V1, processing neuronal activity for each distinct view during scene observation. Novel computational definitions of top-down inhibition (in terms of inhibition of return and selection mechanisms), are also proposed to predict attention in Free-Viewing and Visual Search tasks. Results show that our model outpeforms other biologically-inpired models of saliency prediction while predicting visual saccade sequences with the same model. We also show how temporal and spatial characteristics of inhibition of return can improve prediction of saccades, as well as how distinct search strategies (in terms of feature-selective or category-specific inhibition) can predict attention at distinct image contexts.",19,[],10
1905.02532,q-bio,"The brain as a neuronal system has very complex structure with large diversity of neuronal types. The most basic complexity is seen from the structure of neuronal morphology, which usually has a complex tree-like structure with dendritic spines distributed in branches. For simulating a large-scale network with spiking neurons, the simple point neuron, such as integrate-and-fire neuron, is often used. However, recent experimental evidence suggests that the computational ability of a single neuron is largely enhanced by its morphological structure, in particular, by various types of dendritic dynamics. As morphology reduction of detailed biophysical models is one of classic questions for systems neuroscience, much effort has been taken to simulate a neuron with a few compartments to include the interaction between soma and dendritic spines. Yet, novel reduction methods are still needed to deal with complex dendritic tree. Here by using ten individual Purkinje cells of the cerebellum from three species of guinea-pig, mouse and rat, we consider four types of reduction methods and study their effects on the coding capacity of Purkinje cells in terms of firing rate, timing coding, spiking pattern, and modulated firing under different stimulation protocols. We find that there is a variation of reduction performance depending on individual cells and species, however, all reduction methods can preserve, to some degree, firing activity of the full model of Purkinje cell. Therefore, when stimulating large-scale network of neurons, one has to choose a proper type of reduced neuronal model depending on the questions addressed.",19,[],10

However, the networks lack topographic properties that are present in the visual cortex, such as orientation maps in primary visual cortex and category-selective maps in inferior temporal (IT) cortex. In this work, the minimum wiring cost constraint was approximated as an additional learning rule in order to generate topographic maps of the networks. We found that our topographic deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) can reproduce the category selectivity maps of the primate IT cortex.",19,[],10
1903.04987,q-bio,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by joint inflammation and joint pain. Much of RA treatment is focused on suppressing inflammation, with the idea being that if inflammation is controlled other symptoms, such as pain, will disappear. However, pain is the most common complaint of RA patients, is often still present following the resolution of inflammation, and can develop prior to the onset of inflammation. Thus, further research is needed to better understand RA-associated pain mechanisms. A number of preclinical rodent models commonly used in rheumatology research have been developed based on bedside-to-bench and reverse translational approaches. These models include collagen-induced arthritis, antigen-induced arthritis, streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis, collagen antibody-induced arthritis, serum transfer from K/BxN transgenic mice and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-transgene mice. They have led to increased understanding of RA pathogenesis and have aided the development of successful RA treatments. More recently, these models have been used to elucidate the complexities of RA associated pain. Several potentially modifiable mechanisms, other than inflammation, have been investigated in these models and may in turn lead to more effective treatments. Furthermore, preclinical research can indicate when specific treatment strategies may benefit specific patient subgroups or at which disease stage they are best used. This review not only highlights RA-associated pain mechanisms, but also suggests the usefulness of preclinical animal research based on a bedside-to-bench approach.",19,[],10

These three markers allow identification of infected patients, vaccinated patients and patients who have been in contact with HBV. A positive HBs Ag is usually associated with HBV infection but this interpretation must take into account the clinical context. In particular, the absence of anti-HBc Ab, normal ALAT levels and the absence of jaundice can be associated with recent HBV vaccination or false-positive HBs Ag. Recent HBV vaccination can usually be confirmed by patient questioning, while confirmatory tests are useful to detect false positive HBs Ag. If necessary, a second sample can be requested to confirm the interpretation.",19,[],10
1905.03557,q-bio,"Thyroid hormone (TH) signalling, an evolutionary conserved pathway, is crucial for brain function and cognition throughout life, from early development to ageing. In humans, TH deficiency during pregnancy alters offspring brain development, increasing the risk of cognitive disorders. How TH regulates neurogenesis and subsequent behaviour and cognitive functions remains a major research challenge. Cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying TH signalling on proliferation, survival, determination, migration, differentiation and maturation have been studied in mammalian animal models for over a century. However, recent data show that THs also influence embryonic and adult neurogenesis throughout vertebrates (from mammals to teleosts). These latest observations raise the question of how TH availability is controlled during neurogenesis and particularly in specific neural stem cell populations. This review deals with the role of TH in regulating neurogenesis in the developing and the adult brain across different vertebrate species. Such evo-devo approaches can shed new light on (i) the evolution of the nervous system and (ii) the evolutionary control of neurogenesis by TH across animal phyla. We also discuss the role of thyroid disruptors on brain development in an evolutionary context.",19,[],10
1904.01235,q-bio,"RNA-RNA interaction (RRI) is ubiquitous and has complex roles in the cellular functions. In human health studies, miRNA-target and lncRNAs are among an elite class of RRIs that have been extensively studied. Bacterial ncRNA-target and RNA interference are other classes of RRIs that have received significant attention. In recent studies, mRNA-mRNA interaction instances have been observed, where both partners appear in the same pathway without any direct link between them, or any prior knowledge about their relationship. Those recently discovered cases suggest that RRI scope is much wider than those aforementioned elite classes.   We revisit our RNA-RNA interaction partition function algorithm, piRNA, which computes the partition function, base-pairing probabilities, and structure for the comprehensive Turner energy model using 96 different dynamic programming tables. In this study, we strategically retreat from sophisticated thermodynamic models to the much simpler base pair counting model. That might seem counter-intuitive at the first glance; our idea is to benefit from the advantages of such simple models in terms of running time and memory footprint and compensate for the associated information loss by adding machine learning components in the future.   Here, simple weighted base pair counting is considered to obtain BPPart for Base-pair Partition function and BPMax for Base-pair Maximization, which use 9 and 2 tables respectively. They are empirically 225 and 1350 fold faster than piRNA. A correlation of 0.855 and 0.836 was achieved between piRNA and BPPart and between piRNA and BPMax, respectively, in 37 degrees, and 0.920 and 0.904 in -180 degrees. We also discover two partner RNAs, SNORD3D and TRAF3, and hypothesize their potential roles in genetic diseases.

The beta-thalassaemia carrier state is clinically asymptomatic, thus, making it onerous to diagnose. The current gold standard technique is implausible to be used for onsite carrier detection as the method necessitates expensive instruments, skilled manpower and time. In this study, we have tried to classify the carriers from the healthy samples based on their blood droplet drying patterns using image analysis based tools and subsequently develop an in-house program for automated classification of the same. This automatic, rapid, less laborious and cost-effective technique will significantly increase the total number of carriers that are screened for thalassaemia per year in the country, thus, reducing the burden in the state run advanced health facilities.",19,[],10
1905.10269,q-bio,"The environment has a strong influence on a population's evolutionary dynamics. Driven by both intrinsic and external factors, the environment is subject to continual change in nature. To capture an ever-changing environment, we consider a model of evolutionary dynamics with game transitions, where individuals' behaviors together with the games they play in one time step influence the games to be played next time step. Within this model, we study the evolution of cooperation in structured populations and find a simple rule: weak selection favors cooperation over defection if the ratio of the benefit provided by an altruistic behavior, equation, to the corresponding cost, equation, exceeds equation, where equation is the average number of neighbors of an individual and equation captures the effects of the game transitions. Even if cooperation cannot be favored in each individual game, allowing for a transition to a relatively valuable game after mutual cooperation and to a less valuable game after defection can result in a favorable outcome for cooperation. In particular, small variations in different games being played can promote cooperation markedly. Our results suggest that simple game transitions can serve as a mechanism for supporting prosocial behaviors in highly-connected populations.",19,[],10

One of the family Asteraceae members is the Centaurea damascena which authentically been tested for its antibacterial and antioxidant activity as well as its toxicity. The aims of the study were to determine the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities and toxicity of methanolic plant extracts of Centaurea damascena. The methanolic extracts were screened for their antibacterial activity against nine bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240, and Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 11293, Pseudomonas aerugino and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048 and Salmonella typhi ATCC19430). The antibacterial activity was assessed by using the disc diffusion methods and the minimum inhibition concentrations (MIC) using microdilution method. The extracts from Centaurea damascena possessed antibacterial activity against several of the tested microorganisms. The MIC of methanol extract of C. damascena ranged from 60 to 1100 microgram per mL. Free radical scavenging capacity of the C. damascena methanol extract was calculated by DPPH and FRAP test. DPPH radicals were scavenged with an IC50 value of 17.08 microgram per mL. Antioxidant capacities obtained by the FRAP was 51.9 and expressed in mg Trolox per gram dry weight. The total phenolic compounds of the methanol extracts of aerial parts, as estimated by FolinCiocalteu reagent method, was about 460 mg GAE per gram. The phenolic contents in the extracts highly correlate with their antioxidant activity, confirming that the antioxidant activity of this plant extracts is considerably phenolic contents-dependent.",19,[],10
1912.04949,q-bio,"Background: We estimated the potential number of newly diagnosed HIV infections among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) using a venue-based approach to HIV testing at sex work hotspots.   Methods: We used hotspot enumeration and cross-sectional bio-behavioural survey data from the 2015 Transitions Study of AGYW aged 14-24 years who frequented hotspots in Mombasa, Kenya. We compared the HIV cascade among AGYW who sell sex (YSW, N=408) versus those who do not (NSW, N=891); and triangulated the potential (100% test acceptance and accuracy) and feasible (accounting for test acceptance and sensitivity) number of AGYW that could be newly diagnosed via hotspot-based HIV rapid testing in Mombasa. We identified the profile of AGYW recently tested for HIV (in the past year) using multivariable logistic regression.   Results: N=37/365 (10.1%) YSW and N=30/828 (3.6%) NSW were living with HIV, of whom 27.0% (N=10/37) and 30.0% (N=9/30) were diagnosed and aware (p=0.79). Rapid test acceptance was 89.3% and sensitivity was 80.4%. Hotspot enumeration estimated 15,635 (range: 12,172-19,097) AGYW in hotspots in Mombasa. The potential and feasible number of new diagnosis were 627 (310-1,081), and 450 (223-776), respectively. Thus, hotspot-based testing could feasibly reduce the undiagnosed fraction from 71.6% to 20.2%. The profile of AGYW who recently tested was similar among YSW and NSW. YSW were two-fold more likely to report a recent HIV test after adjusting for other determinants [odds ratio (95% CI): 2.1 (1.6-3.1)].

1907.06305,q-bio,"Foraging in uncertain environments requires balancing the risks associated with finding alternative resources against potential gains. In aridland environments characterized by extreme variation in the amount and seasonal timing of primary production, consumer communities must weigh the risks associated with foraging for preferred seeds that can be cached against fallback foods of low nutritional quality (e.g., leaves) that must be consumed immediately. Here we explore the influence of resource-scarcity, body size, and seasonal uncertainty on the expected foraging behaviors of caching rodents in the northern Chihuahaun Desert by integrating these elements with a Stochastic Dynamic Program (SDP) to determine fitness-maximizing foraging strategies. We demonstrate that resource-limited environments promote dependence on fallback foods, reducing the likelihood of starvation while increasing future risk exposure. Our results point to a qualitative difference in the use of fallback foods and the fitness benefits of caching at the threshold body size of 50 g. Above this threshold the fitness benefits are greater for consumers with smaller caches, affirming empirical observations of cache use among rodents in such dynamic environments. This suggests that larger-bodied consumers with larger caches may be less sensitive to the future uncertainties in monsoonal onset predicted by global climate scenarios.",19,[],10
1903.07585,q-bio,"Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the sole approved therapeutic molecule for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Yet, only a small percentage of patients could benefit from this life-saving treatment because of medical contraindications and severe side effects, including brain hemorrhage, associated with delayed administration. Here, a nano therapeutic agent is realized by directly associating the clinical formulation of tPA to the porous structure of soft discoidal polymeric nanoconstructs (tPA-DPNs). The porous matrix of DPNs protects tPA from rapid degradation, allowing tPA-DPNs to preserve over 70 % of the tPA original activity after 3 h of exposure to serum proteins. Under dynamic conditions, tPA-DPNs dissolve clots more efficiently than free tPA, as demonstrated in a microfluidic chip where clots are formed mimicking in vivo conditions. At 60 min post treatment initiation, the clot area reduces by half (57  8 %) with tPA-DPNs, whereas a similar result (56  21 %) is obtained only after 90 min for free tPA. In murine mesentery venules, the intravenous administration of 2.5 mg/kg of tPA-DPNs resolves almost 90 % of the blood clots, whereas a similar dose of free tPA successfully recanalize only about 40 % of the treated vessels. At about 1/10 of the clinical dose (1.0 mg/kg), tPA-DPNs still effectively dissolve 70 % of the clots, whereas free tPA works efficiently only on 16 % of the vessels. In vivo, discoidal tPA-DPNs outperform the lytic activity of 200 nm spherical tPA-coated nanoconstructs in terms of both percentage of successful recanalization events and clot area reduction. The conjugation of tPA with preserved lytic activity, the deformability and blood circulating time of DPNs together with the faster blood clot dissolution would make tPA-DPNs a promising nanotool for enhancing both potency and safety of thrombolytic therapies.",19,[],10
1908.10101,q-bio,"Many studies have shown that the excitation and inhibition received by cortical neurons remain roughly balanced across many conditions. A key question for understanding the dynamical regime of cortex is the nature of this balancing. Theorists have shown that network dynamics can yield systematic cancellation of most of a neuron's excitatory input by inhibition. We review a wide range of evidence pointing to this cancellation occurring in a regime in which the balance is loose, meaning that the net input remaining after cancellation of excitation and inhibition is comparable in size to the factors that cancel, rather than tight, meaning that the net input is very small relative to the cancelling factors. This choice of regime has important implications for cortical functional responses, as we describe: loose balance, but not tight balance, can yield many nonlinear population behaviors seen in sensory cortical neurons, allow the presence of correlated variability, and yield decrease of that variability with increasing external stimulus drive as observed across multiple cortical areas.",19,[],10
1901.10545,q-bio,"Models of misfolded proteins (MP) aim at discovering the bio-mechanical propagation properties of neurological diseases (ND) by identifying plausible associated dynamical systems. Solving these systems along the full disease trajectory is usually challenging, due to the lack of a well defined time axis for the pathology. This issue is addressed by disease progression models (DPM) where long-term progression trajectories are estimated via time reparametrization of individual observations. However, due to their loose assumptions on the dynamics, DPM do not provide insights on the bio-mechanical properties of MP propagation. Here we propose a unified model of spatio-temporal protein dynamics based on the joint estimation of long-term MP dynamics and time reparameterization of individuals observations. The model is expressed within a Gaussian Process (GP) regression setting, where constraints on the MP dynamics are imposed through non--linear dynamical systems. We use stochastic variational inference on both GP and dynamical system parameters for scalable inference and uncertainty quantification of the trajectories. Experiments on simulated data show that our model accurately recovers prescribed rates along graph dynamics and precisely reconstructs the underlying progression. When applied to brain imaging data our model allows the bio-mechanical interpretation of amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease, leading to plausible simulations of MP propagation, and achieving accurate predictions of individual MP deposition in unseen data.",19,[],10

1911.08980,q-bio,"Neutropenia is an adverse event commonly arising during intensive chemotherapy of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It is often associated with infectious complications. Mathematical modeling, simulation, and optimization of the treatment process would be a valuable tool to support clinical decision making, potentially resulting in less severe side effects and deeper remissions. However, until now, there has been no validated mathematical model available to simulate the effect of chemotherapy treatment on white blood cell (WBC) counts and leukemic cells simultaneously. We developed a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model combining a myelosuppression model considering endogenous granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), a PK model for cytarabine (Ara-C), a subcutaneous absorption model for exogenous G-CSF, and a two-compartment model for leukemic blasts. This model was fitted to data of 44 AML patients during consolidation therapy with a novel Ara-C plus G-CSF schedule from a phase II controlled clinical trial. Additionally, we were able to optimize treatment schedules with respect to disease progression, WBC nadirs, and the amount of Ara-C and G-CSF. The developed PK/PD model provided good prediction accuracies and an interpretation of the interaction between WBCs, G-CSF, and blasts. For 14 patients (those with available bone marrow blast counts), we achieved a median 4.2-fold higher WBC count at nadir, which is the most critical time during consolidation therapy. The simulation results showed that relative bone marrow blast counts remained below the clinically important threshold of 5%, with a median of 60% reduction in Ara-C.",19,[],10
1901.06286,q-bio,The understanding of mechanisms that control epigenetic changes is an important research area in modern functional biology. Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation are in general very stable over many cell divisions. DNA methylation can however be subject to specific and fast changes over a short time scale even in non-dividing (i.e. not-replicating) cells. Such dynamic DNA methylation changes are caused by a combination of active demethylation and de novo methylation processes which have not been investigated in integrated models. Here we present a hybrid (hidden) Markov model to describe the cycle of methylation and demethylation over (short) time scales. Our hybrid model decribes several molecular events either happening at deterministic points (i.e. describing mechanisms that occur only during cell division) and other events occurring at random time points. We test our model on mouse embryonic stem cells using time-resolved data. We predict methylation changes and estimate the efficiencies of the different modification steps related to DNA methylation and demethylation.,19,[],10
1905.02815,q-bio,"A growing number of experimental evidence shows that it is general for a ligand binding protein to have a potential for allosteric regulation and for further evolution. In addition, such proteins generically change their conformation upon binding. O. Rivoire has recently proposed an evolutionary scenario that explains these properties as a generic byproduct of selection for exquisite discrimination between very similar ligands. The initial claim was supported by two classes of basic examples: continuous protein models with small numbers of degrees of freedom, on which the development of a conformational switch was established, and a 2-dimensional spin glass model supporting the rest of the statement. This work aimed to clarify the implication of the exquisite discrimination for smooth models with large number of degrees of freedom, the situation closer to real biological systems. With the help of differential geometry, jet-space analysis, and transversality theorems, it is shown that the claim holds true for any generic flexible system that can be described in terms of smooth manifolds. The result suggests that, indeed, evolutionary solutions to the exquisite discrimination problem, if exist, are located near a codimension-1 subspace of the appropriate genotypical space. This constraint, in turn, gives rise to a potential for the allosteric regulation of the discrimination via generic conformational changes upon binding.",19,[],10
1903.09567,q-bio,"Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection does not predict long-term progress or advancement, nor does it provide a useful way to define or understand these concepts. Nevertheless, the history of life is marked by major trends that appear progressive, and seemingly more advanced forms of life have appeared. To reconcile theory and fact, evolutionists have proposed novel theories that extend natural selection to levels and time frames not justified by the original structure of Darwin's theory. To extend evolutionary theory without violating the most basic tenets of Darwinism, I here identify a separate struggle and an alternative evolutionary force. Owing to the abundant free energy in our universe, there is a struggle for supremacy that naturally rewards those that are first to invent novelties that allow exploitation of untapped resources. This natural reward comes in form of a temporary monopoly, which is granted to those who win a competitive race to innovate. By analogy to human economies, natural selection plays the role of nature's inventor, gradually fashioning inventions to the situation at hand, while natural reward plays the role of nature's entrepreneur, choosing which inventions to first disseminate to large markets. Natural reward leads to progress through a process of invention-conquest macroevolution, in which the dual forces of natural selection and natural reward create and disseminate major innovations. Over vast time frames, natural reward drives the advancement of life by a process of extinction-replacement megaevolution that releases constraints on progress and increases the innovativeness of life.",19,[],10

They observed that the shape parameter of the Weibull model presented systematic changes over time and age when applied to mortality data for males and females in Japan. They have also estimated that this parameter was smaller in the 1891-1898 data in Japan compared to the 1980 mortality data and they presented an illustrative figure for females where the values of the shape parameter are illustrated on the diagram close to the corresponding survival curves. However, they have not provided an analytical explanation of this behavior of the shape parameter of the Weibull model. The cumulative hazard of this model can express the additive process of applying a force in a material for enough time before cracking. To pass to the human data, the Weibull model and the cumulative hazard can express the additive process which disabilities and diseases cause the human organism during the life span leading to healthy life years lost. In this paper we further analytically derive a more general model of survival-mortality in which we estimate a parameter related to the Healthy Life Years Lost (HLYL) and leading to the Weibull model and the corresponding shape parameter as a specific case. We have also demonstrated that the results found for the general HLYL parameter we have proposed provides results similar to those provided by the World Health Organization for the Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) and the corresponding HLYL estimates.

Africa is a carbon sink and nearly half its area comprises arid and semi-arid ecosystems. However, there are uncertainties regarding CO2 fluxes for semi-arid ecosystems in Africa, particularly savannas and dry tropical woodlands. In order to improve on existing remote-sensing based methods for estimating carbon uptake across semi-arid Africa we applied and tested the recently developed plant phenology index (PPI). We developed a PPI-based model estimating gross primary productivity (GPP) that accounts for canopy water stress, and compared it against three other Earth observation-based GPP models: the temperature and greenness model, the greenness and radiation model and a light use efficiency model. The models were evaluated against in situ data from four semi-arid sites in Africa with varying tree canopy cover (3 to 65 percent). Evaluation results from the four GPP models showed reasonable agreement with in situ GPP measured from eddy covariance flux towers (EC GPP) based on coefficient of variation, root-mean-square error, and Bayesian information criterion. The PPI-based GPP model was able to capture the magnitude of EC GPP better than the other tested models.

1907.05528,q-bio,"A common trait of complex systems is that they can be represented by means of a network of interacting parts. It is, in fact, the network organisation (more than the parts) what largely conditions most higher-level properties, which are not reducible to the properties of the individual parts. Can the topological organisation of these webs provide some insight into their evolutionary origins? Both biological and artificial networks share some common architectural traits. They are often heterogeneous and sparse, and most exhibit the small-world property or the presence of modular or hierarchical patterns. These properties have often been attributed to the selection of functionally meaningful traits. However, the proper formulation of generative network models suggests a rather different picture. Against the standard selection-optimisation argument, some networks reveal the inevitable generation of complex patterns resulting from reuse and can be modelled using duplication-rewiring rules. These give rise to the heterogeneous, scale-free and modular architectures observed in the real case studies. Tinkering is a universal mechanism that drives not only biological evolution but also the large-scale dynamics of some technological designs.

1912.06615,q-bio,"Neuroscientists postulate 3D representations in the brain in a variety of different coordinate frames (e.g. 'head-centred', 'hand-centred' and 'world-based'). Recent advances in reinforcement learning demonstrate a quite different approach that may provide a more promising model for biological representations underlying spatial perception and navigation. In this paper, we focus on reinforcement learning methods that reward an agent for arriving at a target image without any attempt to build up a 3D 'map'. We test the ability of this type of representation to support geometrically consistent spatial tasks such as interpolating between learned locations using decoding of feature vectors. We introduce a hand-crafted representation that has, by design, a high degree of geometric consistency and demonstrate that, in this case, information about the persistence of features as the camera translates (e.g. distant features persist) can improve performance on the geometric tasks. These examples avoid Cartesian (in this case, 2D) representations of space. Non-Cartesian, learned representations provide an important stimulus in neuroscience to the search for alternatives to a 'cognitive map'.",19,[],10
1910.00734,q-bio,"Analyses of individual atherosclerotic plaques are mostly descriptive, relying -- for example -- on histological classification by spectral analysis of ultrasound waves or staining and observing particular cellular components. Such passive methods have proved useful for characterizing the structure and vulnerability of plaques but have little quantitative predictive power. In this viewpoint article, we propose an integrated quantitative framework to understand the evolution of plaque. The main approach is to use Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with macrophages, necrotic cells, oxidized lipids, oxygen concentration and PDGF as primary variables coupled to a biomechanical model to describe vessel growth. The model is deterministic, providing mechanical, morphological, and histological characteristics of an atherosclerotic vessel at any desired future time point. We discuss the pros and cons of such a model, how such a model can provide insight to the clinician, and potentially guide therapy. Finally, we use our model to create computer-generated animations of a plaque evolution that are in qualitative agreement with serial ultrasound images published by Kubo et al. (2010) and hypothesize possible atherogenic mechanisms.",19,[],10
1905.00621,q-bio,"Most living systems rely on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to store their genetic information and perpetuate themselves. This biological information has been considered the main target of evolution. However, here we show that symmetries and patterns in the dsDNA sequence can emerge from the physical peculiarities of the dsDNA molecule itself and the maximum entropy principle alone, rather than from biological or environmental evolutionary pressure. The randomness justifies the human codon biases and context-dependent mutation patterns in human populations. Thus, the DNA ""exceptional symmetries"", emerged from the randomness, have to be taken into account when looking for the DNA encoded information. Our results suggest that the double helix energy constraints and, more generally, the physical properties of the dsDNA are the hard drivers of the overall DNA sequence architecture, whereas the biological selective processes act as soft drivers, which only under extraordinary circumstances overtake the overall entropy content of the genome.",19,[],10
1911.07012,q-bio,"Stroke is one of the main causes of human disabilities. Experimental observations indicate that several mechanisms are activated during the recovery of functional activity after a stroke. Here we unveil how the brain recovers by explaining the role played by three mechanisms: Plastic adaptation, hyperexcitability and synaptogenesis. We consider two different damages in a neural network: A diffuse damage that simply causes the reduction of the effective system size and a localized damage, a stroke, that strongly alters the spontaneous activity of the system. Recovery mechanisms observed experimentally are implemented both separately and in a combined way. Interestingly, each mechanism contributes to the recovery to a limited extent. Only the combined application of all three together is able to recover the spontaneous activity of the undamaged system. This explains why the brain triggers independent mechanisms, whose cooperation is the fundamental ingredient for the system recovery.",19,[],10

In spite of a large experimental data, the detailed molecular mechanism of iontophoresis is absent. In the present work the interaction among the external continuous electric field with the outermost layer of the skin (\textitstratum corneum) was studied by coarse-grained molecular dynamics. Our results pointed out the occurrence of water-rich vesicles formation depending on the field strength. The corresponding phase diagram indicated that the large set of phenomena (vesicle formation, reversibility, phase transition, disruption) could be completely controlled by tuning external continuous electric fields. Interestingly, electric field shielding effects are in the origin of observed effects and followed a general Arrhenius-like time dependence. Direct current (DC) electric field usage would also have booster diffusion effects due to vesicles creation and reincorporation which would have direct beneficial absorption effects on water-soluble topical agents (vitamins) or dermal jet-injection of drugs by fine needles.",19,[],10
1905.11800,q-bio,"Two types of osmolytes, i.e., trimethylamin N-oxide (TMAO) and urea, demonstrate dramatically different properties in a protein folding process. Even with the great progresses in revealing the potential underlying mechanism of these two osmolyte systems, many problems still remain unsolved. In this paper, we propose to use the persistent homology, a newly-invented topological method, to systematically study the osmolytes molecular aggregation and their hydrogen-bonding network from a global topological perspective. It has been found that, for the first time, TMAO and urea show two extremely different topological behaviors, i.e., extensive network and local cluster. In general, TMAO forms highly consistent large loop or circle structures in high concentrations. In contrast, urea is more tightly aggregated locally. Moreover, the resulting hydrogen-bonding networks also demonstrate distinguishable features. With the concentration increase, TMAO hydrogen-bonding networks vary greatly in their total number of loop structures and large-sized loop structures consistently increase. In contrast, urea hydrogen-bonding networks remain relatively stable with slight reduce of the total loop number. Moreover, the persistent entropy (PE) is, for the first time, used in characterization of the topological information of the aggregation and hydrogen-bonding networks. The average PE systematically increases with the concentration for both TMAO and urea, and decreases in their hydrogen-bonding networks. But their PE variances have totally different behaviors. Finally, topological features of the hydrogen-bonding networks are found to be highly consistent with those from the ion aggregation systems, indicating that our topological invariants can characterize intrinsic features of the ""structure making"" and ""structure breaking"" systems.",19,[],10

1906.06778,q-bio,"In our recent article (Tu et al., Warnings and caveats in brain controllability, arXiv:1705.08261) we provided quantitative evidence to show that there are warnings and caveats in the way Gu and collaborators (Gu et al. Controllability of structural brain networks. Nature communications 6 (2015): 8414) define brain controllability. The comment by Pasqualetti et al. (Pasqualetti et al. RE: Warnings and Caveats in Brain Controllability. NeuroImage 297 (2019), 586-588) confirms the need to go beyond the methodology and approach presented in Gu et al. original work. In fact, they recognize that the source of confusion is due to the fact that assessing controllability via numerical analysis typically leads to ill-conditioned problems, and thus often generates results that are difficult to interpret. This is indeed the first warning we discussed: our work was not meant to prove that brain networks are not controllable from one node, rather we wished to highlight that the one node controllability framework and all consequent results were not properly justified based on the methodology presented in Gu et al. We used in our work the same method of Gu et al. not because we believe it is the best methodology, but because we extensively investigated it with the aim of replicating, testing and extending their results.

We also demonstrate the application potential of our model by successfully performing multi-step retrosynthetic route planning for four case products, i.e., antiseizure drug Rufinamide, a novel allosteric activator, an inhibitor of human acute-myeloid-leukemia cells and a complex intermediate of drug candidate. Further, by using heuristics Monte Carlo tree search, we achieved automatic retrosynthetic pathway searching and successfully reproduced published synthesis pathways.

1910.05520,q-bio,"The dynamics of infectious diseases propagating in populations depends both on human interaction patterns, the contagion process and the pathogenesis within hosts. The immune system follows a circadian rhythm and, consequently, the chance of getting infected varies with the time of day an individual is exposed to the pathogen. The movement and interaction of people also follow 24-hour cycles, which couples these two phenomena. We use a stochastic metapopulation model informed by hourly mobility data for two medium-sized Chinese cities. By this setup, we investigate how the epidemic risk depends on the difference of the clocks governing the population movement and the immune systems. In most of the scenarios we test, we observe circadian rhythms would constrain the pace and extent of disease emergence. The three measures (strength, outward transmission risk and introduction risk) are highly correlated with each other. For example of the Yushu City, outward transmission risk and introduction risk are correlated with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.83, and the risks correlate to strength with coefficients of equation and equation, respectively (all have equation), in simulations with no circadian effect and equation. The relation between the circadian rhythms of the immune system and daily routines in human mobility can affect the pace and extent of infectious disease spreading.

1912.09205,q-bio,"In contrast to game-theoretic interaction models with additive payoffs, the temporal evolution of natural and artificial systems in often governed by a multiplicative process. In evolutionary biology, these systems are studied within the general framework of fluctuating environments, where the individual entities are subject to spatio-temporal fluctuations in the environmental conditions. In these environments, evolutionary behavior may emerge that essentially differs from the one observed in standard models. The study of the evolution of cooperation in fluctuating environments typically assumes a homogeneous, well mixed population, whose constituents choose between two behavioral strategies. In this paper, we generalize these results by developing a systematic study of the cooperation dynamics in fluctuating environments under the consideration of structured, heterogeneous populations with individual entities subjected to general behavioral rules. We find that, in the presence of environmental fluctuations, the cooperation dynamics yields the creation of network components with distinct evolutionary properties. We utilize this result to examine the applicability of a generalized reciprocity behavioral rule in a variety of settings. We thereby show that the introduced rule leads to steady state cooperative behavior that is always greater than or equal to the one predicted by the evolutionary stability analysis of unconditional cooperation. As a consequence, the implementation of our results may go beyond explaining the evolution of cooperation. In particular, they can be directly applied in domains that deal with the development of artificial systems able to adequately mimic reality, such as reinforcement learning.",19,[],10
1901.08093,q-bio,"Multimodal behavior involves multiple processing stations distributed across distant brain regions, but our understanding of how such distributed processing is coordinated in the brain is limited. Here we take a decoding approach to this problem, aiming to quantify how temporal aspects of brain-wide neural activity may be used to infer specific multimodal behaviors. Using high temporal resolution measurements by MEG, we detect bursts of activity from hundreds of locations across the surface of the brain at millisecond resolution. We then compare decoding using three characteristics of neural activity bursts, decoding with event counts, with latencies and with time differences between pairs of events. Training decoders in this regime is particularly challenging because the number of samples is smaller by orders of magnitude than the input dimensionality. We develop a new decoding approach for this regime that combines non-parametric modelling with aggressive feature selection. Surprisingly, we find that decoding using time-differences, based on thousands of region pairs, is significantly more accurate than using other activity characteristics, reaching 90% accuracy consistently across subjects. These results suggest that relevant information about multimodal brain function is provided by subtle time differences across remote brain areas.",19,[],10
1908.08135,q-bio,"Background. Human aging is linked to many prevalent diseases. The aging process is highly influenced by genetic factors. Hence, it is important to identify human aging-related genes. We focus on supervised prediction of such genes. Gene expression-based methods for this purpose study genes in isolation from each other. While protein-protein interaction (PPI) network-based methods for this purpose account for interactions between genes' protein products, current PPI network data are context-unspecific, spanning different biological conditions. Instead, here, we focus on an aging-specific subnetwork of the entire PPI network, obtained by integrating aging-specific gene expression data and PPI network data. The potential of such data integration has been recognized but mostly in the context of cancer. So, we are the first to propose a supervised learning framework for predicting aging-related genes from an aging-specific PPI subnetwork.   Results. In a systematic and comprehensive evaluation, we find that in many of the evaluation tests: (i) using an aging-specific subnetwork indeed yields more accurate aging-related gene predictions than using the entire network, and (ii) predictive methods from our framework that have not previously been used for supervised prediction of aging-related genes outperform existing prominent methods for the same purpose.

1905.00235,q-bio,"At the scale of the individual cell, protein production is a stochastic process with multiple time scales, combining quick and slow random steps with discontinuous and smooth variation. Hybrid stochastic processes, in particular piecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMP), are well adapted for describing such situations. PDMPs approximate the jump Markov processes traditionally used as models for stochastic chemical reaction networks. Although hybrid modelling is now well established in biology, these models remain computationally challenging. We propose several improved methods for computing time dependent multivariate probability distributions (MPD) of PDMP models of gene networks. In these models, the promoter dynamics is described by a finite state, continuous time Markov process, whereas the mRNA and protein levels follow ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The Monte-Carlo method combines direct simulation of the PDMP with analytic solutions of the ODEs. The push-forward method numerically computes the probability measure advected by the deterministic ODE flow, through the use of analytic expressions of the corresponding semigroup. Compared to earlier versions of this method, the probability of the promoter states sequence is computed beyond the naive mean field theory and adapted for non-linear regulation functions.",19,[],10

In this study, we introduce a novel expression pattern that key regulators expose along the differentiation path. We deploy this pattern to identify the cell-specific key regulators responsible for the development. As proof of concept, we consider this approach to data on six developmental stages from mouse embryonic stem cells to terminally differentiated macrophages.",19,[],10
1907.10748,q-bio,"How cells regulate the number of organelles is a fundamental question in cell biology. While decades of experimental work have uncovered four fundamental processes that regulate organelle biogenesis, namely, de novo synthesis, fission, fusion and decay, a comprehensive understanding of how these processes together control organelle abundance remains elusive. Recent fluorescence microscopy experiments allow for the counting of organelles at the single-cell level. These measurements provide information about the cell-to-cell variability in organelle abundance in addition to the mean level. Motivated by such measurements, we build upon a recent study and analyze a general stochastic model of organelle biogenesis. We compute the exact analytical expressions for the probability distribution of organelle numbers, their mean, and variance across a population of single cells. It is shown that different mechanisms of organelle biogenesis lead to distinct signatures in the distribution of organelle numbers which allows us to discriminate between these various mechanisms. By comparing our theory against published data for peroxisome abundance measurements in yeast, we show that a widely believed model of peroxisome biogenesis that involves de novo synthesis, fission, and decay is inadequate in explaining the data. Also, our theory predicts bimodality in certain limits of the model. Overall, the framework developed here can be harnessed to gain mechanistic insights into the process of organelle biogenesis.",19,[],10
1912.10262,q-bio,"The task of the brain is to look for structure in the external input. We study a network of integrate-and-fire neurons with several types of recurrent connections that learns the structure of its time-varying feedforward input by attempting to efficiently represent this input with spikes. The efficiency of the representation arises from incorporating the structure of the input into the decoder, which is implicit in the learned synaptic connectivity of the network. While in the original work of [Boerlin, Machens, Den\`eve 2013] and [Brendel et al., 2017] the structure learned by the network to make the representation efficient was the low-dimensionality of the feedforward input, in the present work it is its temporal dynamics. The network achieves the efficiency by adjusting its synaptic weights in such a way, that for any neuron in the network, the recurrent input cancels the feedforward for most of the time. We show that if the only temporal structure that the input possesses is that it changes slowly on the time scale of neuronal integration, the dimensionality of the network dynamics is equal to the dimensionality of the input. However, if the input follows a linear differential equation of the first order, the efficiency of the representation can be increased by increasing the dimensionality of the network dynamics in comparison to the dimensionality of the input. If there is only one type of slow synaptic current in the network, the increase is two-fold, while if there are two types of slow synaptic currents that decay with different rates and whose amplitudes can be adjusted separately, it is advantageous to make the increase three-fold. We numerically simulate the network with synaptic weights that imply the most efficient input representation in the above cases. We also propose a learning rule by means of which the corresponding synaptic weights can be learned.",19,[],10

1903.10322,q-bio,"Ecological connectivity in coastal oceanic waters is mediated by dispersion of the early life stages of marine organisms and conditions the structure of biological communities and the provision of ecosystem services. Integrated management strategies aimed at ensuring long-term service provision to society do not currently consider the importance of dispersal and larval connectivity. A spatial optimization model is introduced to maximise the potential provision of ecosystem services in coastal areas by accounting for the role of dispersal and larval connectivity. The approach combines a validated coastal circulation model that reproduces realistic patterns of larval transport along the coast, which ultimately conditions the biological connectivity and productivity of an area, with additional spatial layers describing potential ecosystem services. The spatial optimization exercise was tested along the coast of Central Chile, a highly productive area dominated by the Humboldt Current. Results show it is unnecessary to relocate existing management areas, as increasing no-take areas by 10% could maximise ecosystem service provision, while improving the spatial representativeness of protected areas and minimizing social conflicts. The location of protected areas was underrepresented in some sections of the study domain, principally due to the restriction of the model to rocky subtidal habitats. Future model developments should encompass the diversity of coastal ecosystems and human activities to inform integrative spatial management. Nevertheless, the spatial optimization model is innovative not only for its integrated ecosystem perspective, but also because it demonstrates that it is possible to incorporate time-varying biophysical connectivity within the optimization problem, thereby linking the dynamics of exploited populations produced by the spatial management regime.",19,[],10

However, answering these questions is more complicated than it seems at first glance and touches on many old issues about the interpretation of human genetic variation.

1903.12138,q-bio,"Current scientific consensus holds that sound is transmitted, solely mechanically, from the tympanum to the cochlea via ossicles.

We demonstrate experimentally that the tympanum produces piezoelectric potentials isochronous to acoustic vibrations thanks to its collagen fibers and that their amplitude increases along with the frequency and level of the vibrations. This finding supports the existence of an electrical pathway, specialized in transmitting high-frequency sounds, that works in unison with the mechanical pathway. A bio-organic triode, similar to a field effect transistor, is the key mechanism of our hypothesized pathway. We present evidence that any deficiency along this pathway produces hearing impairment.

1901.08635,q-bio,"Phenotypic heterogeneity in cancer cells is widely observed and is often linked to drug resistance. In several cases, such heterogeneity in drug sensitivity of tumors is driven by stochastic and reversible acquisition of a drug tolerant phenotype by individual cells even in an isogenic population.

In this study, we analyze stochastic models of phenotypic switching to provide a framework for analyzing cell-fate transitions such as EMT as a source of phenotypic variability in drug sensitivity. Motivated by our cell-culture based experimental observations connecting phenotypic switching in EMT and drug resistance, we analyze a coarse-grained model of phenotypic switching between two states in the presence of cytotoxic stress from chemotherapy.

To explore the complex interactions beyond volume exclusion, we employed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to explore the conformational ensemble of apoazurin in a box of monodisperse crowders under strong chemically denaturing conditions. The elongated conformation of unfolded apoazurin appears to result from the interplay of the effective attraction between the protein and crowders and the shape of the crowders.

1912.06724,q-bio,"Closed loop anesthesia delivery (CLAD) systems can help anesthesiologists efficiently achieve and maintain desired anesthetic depth over an extended period of time. A typical CLAD system would use an anesthetic marker, calculated from physiological signals, as real-time feedback to adjust anesthetic dosage towards achieving a desired set-point of the marker. Since control strategies for CLAD vary across the systems reported in recent literature, a comparative analysis of common control strategies can be useful. For a nonlinear plant model based on well-established models of compartmental pharmacokinetics and sigmoid-Emax pharmacodynamics, we numerically analyze the set-point tracking performance of three output-feedback linear control strategies: proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, and an LQG with integral action (ILQG). Specifically, we numerically simulate multiple CLAD sessions for the scenario where the plant model parameters are unavailable for a patient and the controller is designed based on a nominal model and controller gains are held constant throughout a session. Based on the numerical analyses performed here, conditioned on our choice of model and controllers, we infer that in terms of accuracy and bias PID control performs better than ILQG which in turn performs better than LQG. In the case of noisy observations, ILQG can be tuned to provide a smoother infusion rate while achieving comparable steady-state response with respect to PID. The numerical analyses framework and findings, reported here, can help CLAD developers in their choice of control strategies.

Typically, weakly interacting species that occupy largely distinct niches result in stable mixed populations, while strong interactions and competition for the same niche results in rapid extinctions of some species and fixations of others.

1901.02068,q-bio,"Objective: Establish suitable frequency spacing and demodulation steps to use when extracting impedance changes from frequency division multiplexed (FDM) carrier signals in peripheral nerve. Approach: Experiments were performed in-vitro on cadavers immediately following euthanasia. Neural activity was evoked via stimulation of nerves in the hind paw, while carrier signals were injected, and recordings obtained, with a dual ring nerve cuff implanted on the sciatic nerve. Frequency analysis of recorded compound action potentials (CAPs) and extracted impedance changes, with the latter obtained using established demodulation methods, were used to determine suitable frequency spacing of carrier signals, and bandpass filter (BPF) bandwidth and order, for a frequency multiplexed signal. Main results: CAPs and impedance changes were dominant in the frequency band 200 to 500 Hz and 100 to 200 Hz, respectively. A Tukey window was introduced to remove ringing from Gibbs phenomena. A /- 750 Hz BPF bandwidth was selected to encompass 99.99 % of the frequency power of the impedance change. Modelling predicted a minimum BPF order of 16 for 2 kHz spacing, and 10 for 4 kHz spacing, were required to avoid ringing from the neighbouring carrier signal, while FDM experiments verified BPF orders of 12 and 8, respectively, were required. With a notch filter centred on the neighbouring signal, a BPF order of at least 6 or 4 was required for 2 and 4 kHz, respectively. Significance: The results establish drive frequency spacing and demodulation settings for use in FDM electrical impedance tomography (EIT) experiments, as well as a framework for their selection, and, for the first time, demonstrates the viability of FDM-EIT of neural activity on peripheral nerve, which will be a central aspect of future real-time neural-EIT systems and EIT-based neural prosthetics interfaces.",19,[],10
1901.06967,q-bio,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae target of rapamycin (TOR) complex 2 (TORC2) is an essential regulator of plasma membrane lipid and protein homeostasis. How TORC2 activity is modulated in response to changes in the status of the cell envelope is unclear. Here we document that TORC2 subunit Avo2 is a direct target of Slt2, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) of the cell wall integrity pathway. Activation of Slt2 by overexpression of a constitutively active allele of an upstream Slt2 activator (Pkc1) or by auxin-induced degradation of a negative Slt2 regulator (Sln1) caused hyperphosphorylation of Avo2 at its MAPK phosphoacceptor sites in a Slt2-dependent manner and diminished TORC2-mediated phosphorylation of its major downstream effector, protein kinase Ypk1. Deletion of Avo2 or expression of a phosphomimetic Avo2 allele rendered cells sensitive to two stresses (myriocin treatment and elevated exogenous acetic acid) that the cell requires Ypk1 activation by TORC2 to survive. Thus, Avo2 is necessary for optimal TORC2 activity, and Slt2-mediated phosphorylation of Avo2 down-regulates TORC2 signaling.

1908.05736,q-bio,"There is an increasing interest in the systematic disagreement about profoundly ambiguous stimuli in the color domain. However, this research has been hobbled by the fact that we could not create such stimuli at will. Here, we describe a design principle that allows the creation of such stimuli and apply this principle to create one such stimulus set - the crocs and socks. Using this set, we probed the color perception of a large sample of observers, showing that these stimuli are indeed categorically ambiguous and that we can predict the percept from fabric priors resulting from experience. We also relate the perception of these crocs to other color-ambiguous stimuli - the dress and the sneaker and conclude that differential priors likely underlie polarized disagreement in cognition more generally.",19,[],10
1904.11769,quant-ph,"We begin this thesis by expanding the technique of teleportation simulation, which adds noise to the entangled resource state to mimic channel effects. By introducing classical noise in the communication step, we show it is possible to simulate more than just Pauli channels using teleportation. This new class is characterised, and studied in detail for a particular resource state, leading to a family of simulable channels named ""Pauli-Damping channels"" whose properties are analysed.   Also introduced are a new family of quantum states, ""phase Werner"" states, whose entanglement properties relate to the interesting conjecture of bound entangled states with a negative partial transpose. Holevo-Werner channels, to which these states are connected, are shown to be teleportation covariant. We exploit this to present several interesting results, including the optimal estimation of the channel-defining parameter. The minimal binary-discrimination error for Holevo-Werner channels is bounded for the first time with the analytical form of the quantum Chernoff bound. We also consider the secret key capacity of these channels, showing how different entanglement measures provide a better upper bound for different regions of these channels.   Finally, a method for generating new Bell inequalities is presented, exploiting nonphysical probability distributions to obtain new inequalities. Tens of thousands of new inequivalent inequalities are generated, and their usefulness in closing the detection loophole for imperfect detectors is examined, with comparison to the current optimal construction. Two candidate Bell inequalities which may equal or beat the best construction are presented.",19,[],6
1912.00258,quant-ph,"We calculate the out-of-time-ordered correlation function (OTOC) of a single impurity qubit coupled to fully a connected many-particle system such as a bosonic Josephson junction or spins with long-range interactions. In these systems the qubit OTOC can be used to detect both ground state and excited state quantum phase transitions (QPTs), making it a robust order parameter that is considerably more sensitive than the standard one-body correlation function. Finite size scaling exponents for an equation body system can also be accurately extracted from the long-time OTOC dynamics, however, for short times there is a discrepancy due to the fact that the qubit has not had enough time to couple to the larger system. Our results show that the OTOC of even the smallest probe is enough to diagnose a QPT in fully connected models but, like a continuous measurement, can still cause a backaction effect which leads to weakly chaotic dynamics and gradual information scrambling.",19,[],6

1910.08591,quant-ph,"A misunderstanding of entangled states has spawned decades of concern about quantum measurements and a plethora of quantum interpretations. The ""measurement state"" or ""Schrodinger's cat state"" of a superposed quantum system and its detector is nonlocally entangled, suggesting that we turn to nonlocality experiments for insight into measurements. By studying the full range of superposition phases, these experiments show precisely what the measurement state does and does not superpose. These experiments reveal that the measurement state is not, as had been supposed, a paradoxical superposition of detector states. It is instead a nonparadoxical superposition of two correlations between detector states and system states. In this way, the experimental results resolve the problem of definite outcomes (""Schrodinger's cat""), leading to a resolution of the measurement problem. However, this argument does not yet resolve the measurement problem because it is based on the results of experiments, while measurement is a theoretical problem: How can standard quantum theory explain the definite outcomes seen experimentally? Thus, we summarize the nonlocality experiments' supporting theory, which rigorously predicts the experimental results directly from optical paths. Several previous theoretical analyses of the measurement problem have relied on the reduced density operators derived from the measurement state, but these solutions have been rejected due to criticism of reduced density operators. Because it avoids reduced density operators, the optical-path analysis is immune to such criticism.",19,[],6

It is shown that, most generally, gates are described by a set of coined quantum walks. Rotating wave and resonant approximations for field-matter interaction simplify the walks, factorizing the coin, and leading to pure continuous time quantum walk description. The walks reside on a graph formed by the Hilbert space of all involved qubits and auxiliary states, if present.

However, large-scale implementation of photonic quantum computing has been hindered by its intrinsic difficulties, such as probabilistic entangling gates for photonic qubits and lack of scalable ways to build photonic circuits. Here we discuss how to overcome these limitations by taking advantage of two key ideas which have recently emerged. One is a hybrid qubit-continuous variable approach for realizing a deterministic universal gate set for photonic qubits. The other is time-domain multiplexing technique to perform arbitrarily large-scale quantum computing without changing the configuration of photonic circuits. These ideas together will enable scalable implementation of universal photonic quantum computers in which hardware-efficient error correcting codes can be incorporated. Furthermore, all-optical implementation of such systems can increase the operational bandwidth beyond THz in principle, utimately enabling large-scale fault-tolerant universal quantum computers with ultra-high operation frequency.",19,[],6
1911.07860,quant-ph,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows for secure communications safe against attacks by quantum computers. QKD protocols are performed by sending a sizeable, but finite, number of quantum signals between the distant parties involved. Many QKD experiments however predict their achievable key rates using asymptotic formulas, which assume the transmission of an infinite number of signals, partly because QKD proofs with finite transmissions (and finite key lengths) can be difficult. Here we develop a robust numerical approach for calculating the key rates for QKD protocols in the finite-key regime in terms of two novel semi-definite programs (SDPs). The first uses the relation between smooth min-entropy and quantum relative entropy, and the second uses the relation between the smooth min-entropy and quantum fidelity. We then solve these SDPs using convex optimization solvers and obtain some of the first numerical calculations of finite key rates for several different protocols, such as BB84, B92, and twin-field QKD. Our numerical approach democratizes the composable security proofs for QKD protocols where the derived keys can be used as an input to another cryptosystem.",19,[],6

Unlike traditional quantum coherence resource theories, QCRTF can be made independent of the single-particle basis and allow to quantify coherence within and between particle number sectors. For example, QCRTF can be formulated in such a way that neither Bose-Einstein condensates nor Heisenberg-Weyl coherent states are considered as quantum many-body coherence resources, whereas spin-squeezed and quadrature squeezed states are. The QCRTF framework is utilized to calculate the optimal asymptotic distillation rate of maximally correlated bosonic states both for particle number conserving resource states and resource states of indefinite particle number. In particular, we show how to generate a uniform superposition of maximally correlated bosonic states from a state of maximal bosonic coherence with asymptotically unit efficiency using only free operations in the QCRTF.",19,[],6

This Wannier basis method also allows us to define the length of a Planck cell in the spectrum that measures how many Planck cells the system will traverse if it starts at the given Planck cell.

Our approach uses the alpha-representation of the SCSs in infinite Hilbert space with base in terms of displaced number states characterized by the displacement amplitude alpha. An arbitrary alpha-representation of SCSs enables manipulation of the amplitudes in wider ranges of parameters, greatly expanding the possibilities for generation of desired nonclassical states. The optical scheme we consider is quite universal for implementation of the conditioned states close to SCSs with use of linear-optics elements and detectors projecting unitarily transformed input states onto the target one.

1902.07869,quant-ph,"Entanglement is a key resource for quantum information processing. A widely used tool for detecting entanglement is entanglement witness, where the measurement of the witness operator is guaranteed to be positive for all separable states and can be negative for certain entangled states. In reality, due to the exponentially increasing the Hilbert-space dimension with respective to the system size, it is very challenging to construct an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states. For equation-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires equation local measurement settings and can tolerate up to equation white noise. As a comparison, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states only needs two local measurement settings and can tolerate up to equation white noise. There is a trade-off between the realization efficiency, the number of measurement settings, and the detection robustness, the maximally tolerable white noise. In this work, we study this trade-off by proposing a family of entanglement witnesses with equation (equation) local measurement settings. Considering symmetric local measurements, we calculate the maximal tolerable noise for any given number of measurement settings. Consequently, we design the optimal witness with a minimal number of settings for any given level of white noise. Our theoretical analysis can be applied to other multipartite entangled states with a strong symmetry. Our witnesses can be easily implemented in experiment and applied in practical multipartite entanglement detection under different noise conditions.",19,[],6
1902.08790,quant-ph,"Quantum thermal devices which can manage heat as their electronic analogues for the electronic currents have attracted increasing attention. Here a three-terminal quantum thermal device is designed by three coupling qubits interacting with three heat baths with different temperatures. Based on the steady-state behavior solved from the dynamics of this system, it is demonstrated that such a device integrates multiple interesting thermodynamic functions. It can serve as a heat current transistor to use the weak heat current at one terminal to effectively amplify the currents through the other two terminals, to continuously modulate them ranging in a large amplitude, and even to switch on/off the heat currents. It is also found that the three currents are not sensitive to the fluctuation of the temperature at the low temperature terminal, so it can behave as a thermal stabilizer. In addition, we can utilize one terminal temperature to ideally turn off the heat current at any one terminal and to allow the heat currents through the other two terminals, so it can be used as a thermal valve. Finally, we illustrate that this thermal device can control the heat currents to flow unidirectionally, so it has the function as a thermal rectifier.",19,[],6
1907.11947,quant-ph,"Single-shot readout is a key component for scalable quantum information processing. However, many solid-state qubits with favorable properties lack the single-shot readout capability. One solution is to use the repetitive quantum-non-demolition readout technique, where the qubit is correlated with an ancilla, which is subsequently read out. The readout fidelity is therefore limited by the back-action on the qubit from the measurement. Traditionally, a threshold method is taken, where only the total photon count is used to discriminate qubit state, discarding all the information of the back-action hidden in the time trace of repetitive readout measurement. Here we show by using machine learning (ML), one obtains higher readout fidelity by taking advantage of the time trace data. ML is able to identify when back-action happened, and correctly read out the original state. Since the information is already recorded (but usually discarded), this improvement in fidelity does not consume additional experimental time, and could be directly applied to preparation-by-measurement and quantum metrology applications involving repetitive readout.",19,[],6

We report a concurrence of up to 0.969, a huge improvement over the 0.736 which was suggested and analyzed in great detail in Ref. [1]. This significant enhancement is achieved by introducing microtoroidal resonators which serve as efficient photonic interface between light and matter.

However, in this paper, we point out that this is not the case, because the query complexity of Yoder's algorithm is actually in equation rather than equation, where equation is a known lower bound of equation. (ii) In terms of the trail-and-error method, currently the algorithm without randomness has to take more than 1 times queries or iterations than the algorithm with randomly selected parameters.

The upper bound of expected queries as well as the optimal parameters are derived. Compared with Yoder's algorithm, the query complexity of our algorithm indeed achieves the optimal scaling in equation for quantum search, which reconfirms the practicality of the fixed-point method.

In this paper, an improvement for the identification is presented both in the resolution and precision via a modified algorithm of direct cross correlation extraction. A flexible resolution down to 1 ps is realized, which is only dependent on the Least Significant Bit (LSB) resolution of the time-tagging device. The attainable precision is shown mainly determined by the inherent timing jitter of the single photon detectors, the acquired pair rate and acquisition time, and a sub picosecond precision (0.72 ps) has been achieved at an acquisition time of 4.5 s. This high-precision nonlocal measurement realization provides a solid foundation for the field applications of entanglement-based quantum clock synchronization, ranging and communications.",19,[],6
1904.06059,quant-ph,"Nondegenerate four-wave mixing (FWM) process based on a double-equation scheme in hot alkali metal vapor is a versatile tool in quantum state engineering, quantum imaging, and quantum precision measurements. In this Letter, we investigate the generation of quantum correlated twin beams which carry nonzero orbital angular momentums (OAMs) based on the FWM process in hot cesium vapor. The amplified probe beam and the newly generated conjugate beam in the FWM process have the same and opposite topological charge as the seed beam, respectively. We also explore the FWM process operated in a nonamplifying regime where quantum correlated twin beams carrying OAMs can still be generated. In this regime, the FWM process plays the role of quantum beam splitter for the OAM of light, that is, a device that can split a coherent light beam carrying OAM into quantum-correlated twin beams carrying OAMs. More generally, our setup can be used as a quantum beam splitter of images.",19,[],6

Our protocol is universal and able to automatically sort the input under minimal assumptions, yet partially preserving information contained in the states. We quantify analytically its performance for arbitrary size and dimension of the data. We contrast it with the performance of its classical counterpart, which clusters data that has been sampled from two unknown probability distributions. We find that the quantum protocol fully exploits the dimensionality of the quantum data to achieve a much higher performance, provided data is at least three-dimensional.

1902.10036,quant-ph,"Multi-qubit quantum Rabi model, which is a fundamental model describing light-matter interaction, plays an important role in various physical systems. In this paper, we propose a theoretical method to simulate multi-qubit quantum Rabi model in a circuit quantum electrodynamics system. By means of external transversal and longitudinal driving fields, an effective Hamiltonian describing the multi-qubit quantum Rabi model is derived. The effective frequency of the resonator and the effective splitting of the qubits depend on the external driving fields. By adjusting the frequencies and the amplitudes of the driving fields, the stronger coupling regimes could be reached. The numerical simulation shows that our proposal works well in a wide range of parameter space. Moreover, our scheme can be utilized to generate two-qubit gate, Schrodinger states, and multi-qubit GHZ states. The maximum displacement of the Schrodinger cat states can be enhanced by increasing the number of the qubits and the relative coupling strength. It should be mention that we can obtain high fidelity Schrodinger cat states and multi-qubit GHZ states even the system suffering dissipation. The presented proposal may open a way to study the stronger coupling regimes whose coupling strength is far away from ultrastrong coupling regimes.",19,[],6

This effect may be stronger than quantum radiation produced by variations of the refractive index equation since the latter are typically very small and yield photon numbers of order equation. As another difference, we find that the partner particles of the created medium photons are not other medium photons but excitations of the environment field causing the dissipation (which is switched on and off).",19,[],6
1910.01662,quant-ph,"Surface codes are a promising method of quantum error correction and the basis of many proposed quantum computation implementations. However, their efficient decoding is still not fully explored. Recently, approaches based on machine learning techniques have been proposed by Torlai and Melko as well as Varsamopoulos et al. In these approaches, a so called high level decoder is used to post-correct an underlying decoder by correcting logical errors. A significant problem is that these methods require large amounts of training data even for relatively small code distances. The above-mentioned methods were tested on the rotated surface code which encodes one logical qubit. Here, we show that they are viable even for the toric surface code which encodes two logical qubits. Furthermore, we explain how symmetries of the toric code can be exploited to reduce the amount of training data that is required to obtain good decoding results. Finally, we compare different underlying decoders and show that the accuracy of high level decoding noticeably depends on the quality of the underlying decoder in the realistic case of imperfect training.",19,[],6

By employing quantum systems as sensors to probe some physical property of interest allows the application of quantum resources, such as coherent superpositions and quantum correlations, to increase measurement precision. Here we experimentally investigate a scheme for quantum target detection based on linear optical measurment devices, when the object is immersed in unpolarized background light. By comparing the quantum (polarization-entangled photon pairs) and the classical (separable polarization states), we found that the quantum strategy provides us an improvement over the classical one in our experiment when the signal to noise ratio is greater than 1/40, or about 16dB of noise. This is in constrast to quantum target detection considering non-linear optical detection schemes, which have shown resilience to extreme amounts of noise. A theoretical model is developed which shows that, in this linear-optics context, the quantum strategy suffers from the contribution of multiple background photons. This effect does not appear in our classical scheme. By improving the two-photon detection electronics, it should be possible to achieve a polarization-based quantum advantage for a signal to noise ratio that is close to 1/400 for current technology.",19,[],6

We determine the range of the possible values of the error and disturbance for arbitrary Stern-Gerlach apparatuses with the orbital degree prepared in an arbitrary Gaussian state. We show that their error-disturbance region is close to the theoretical optimal and actually violates Heisenberg's EDR in a broad range of experimental parameters.

However, as one generalizes the situation to multi-path interference, it is found that conventional interference visibility is not a good quantifier. A recently introduced measure of quantum coherence has been shown to be a good quantifier of the wave nature.

1904.08260,quant-ph,"Single nuclear spins in the solid state have long been envisaged as a platform for quantum computing, due to their long coherence times and excellent controllability. Measurements can be performed via localised electrons, for example those in single atom dopants or crystal defects. However, establishing long-range interactions between multiple dopants or defects is challenging. Conversely, in lithographically-defined quantum dots, tuneable interdot electron tunnelling allows direct coupling of electron spin-based qubits in neighbouring dots. Moreover, compatibility with semiconductor fabrication techniques provides a compelling route to scaling to large numbers of qubits. Unfortunately, hyperfine interactions are typically too weak to address single nuclei. Here we show that for electrons in silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor quantum dots the hyperfine interaction is sufficient to initialise, read-out and control single silicon-29 nuclear spins, yielding a combination of the long coherence times of nuclear spins with the flexibility and scalability of quantum dot systems. We demonstrate high-fidelity projective readout and control of the nuclear spin qubit, as well as entanglement between the nuclear and electron spins.

1911.10598,quant-ph,"The success of quantum noise sensing methods depends on the optimal interplay between properly designed control pulses and statistically informative measurement data on a specific quantum-probe observable. To enhance the information content of the data and reduce as much as possible the number of measurements on the probe, the filter orthogonalization method has been recently introduced. The latter is able to transform the control filter functions on an orthogonal basis allowing for the optimal reconstruction of the noise power spectral density. In this paper, we formalize this method within the standard formalism of minimum mean squared error estimation and we show the equivalence between the solutions of the two approaches. Then, we introduce a non-negative least squares formulation that ensures the non-negativeness of the estimated noise spectral density.

1912.01031,quant-ph,"Classical and quantum physics impose different constraints on the joint probability distributions of observed variables in a causal structure. These differences mean that certain correlations can be certified as non-classical, which has both foundational and practical importance. Rather than working with the probability distribution itself, it can instead be convenient to work with the entropies of the observed variables. In the Bell causal structure with two inputs and outputs per party, a technique that uses entropic inequalities is known that can always identify non-classical correlations. Here we consider the analogue of this technique in the generalization of this scenario to more outcomes. We identify a family of non-classical correlations in the Bell scenario with two inputs and three outputs per party whose non-classicality cannot be detected through the direct analogue of the previous technique. We also show that use of Tsallis entropy instead of Shannon entropy does not help in this case. Furthermore, we give evidence that natural extensions of the technique also do not help. More precisely, our evidence suggests that even if we allow the observed correlations to be post-processed according to a natural class of non-classicality non-generating operations, entropic inequalities for either the Shannon or Tsallis entropies cannot detect the non-classicality, and hence that entropic inequalities are generally not sufficient to detect non-classicality in the Bell causal structure.

1909.08527,quant-ph,"Quantum walk research has mainly focused on evolutions due to repeated applications of time-independent unitary coin operators. However, the idea of controlling the single particle evolution using time-dependent unitary coins has still been a subject of multiple studies as it not only hosts interesting possibilities for quantum information processing but also opens a much richer array of phenomena including static and dynamic localizations. So far, such studies have been performed only for single quantum walkers. In case of multi-walker systems, time-dependent coins may generate measurable phenomena not described by the single-particle model, due to entanglement and interaction among the walkers. In this context, we present here a thorough numerical study of an one dimensional system of two quantum walkers exhibiting rich collective dynamics controlled by simple time-dependent unitary coins proposed in [Phys.

Since dimensionality grows exponentially with the number of qubits, the potential power of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices over classical resources also stems from entangled states in high dimensions. An important family of quantum protocols that can take advantage of high-dimensional Hilbert space are classification tasks. These include quantum machine learning algorithms, witnesses in quantum information processing and certain decision problems. However, due to counter-intuitive geometrical properties emergent in high dimensions, classification problems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We demonstrate that the amount of perturbation needed for an adversary to induce a misclassification scales inversely with dimensionality. This is shown to be a fundamental feature independent of the details of the classification protocol. Furthermore, this leads to a trade-off between the security of the classification algorithm against adversarial attacks and quantum advantages we expect for high-dimensional problems. In fact, protection against these adversarial attacks require extra resources that scale at least polynomially with the Hilbert space dimension of the system, which can erase any significant quantum advantage that we might expect from a quantum protocol.

One way to achieve this sensitivity is by engineering a strong but nonresonant interaction between the oscillator and an atom. In a system with sufficient quantum coherence, this interaction allows one to distinguish different phonon number states by resolvable differences in the atom's transition frequency. Such dispersive measurements have been studied in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics where experiments using real and artificial atoms have resolved the photon number states of cavities. Here, we report an experiment where an artificial atom senses the motional energy of a driven nanomechanical oscillator with sufficient sensitivity to resolve the quantization of its energy. To realize this, we build a hybrid platform that integrates nanomechanical piezoelectric resonators with a microwave superconducting qubit on the same chip. We excite phonons with resonant pulses of varying amplitude and probe the resulting excitation spectrum of the qubit to observe phonon-number-dependent frequency shifts equation times larger than the qubit linewidth. Our result demonstrates a fully integrated platform for quantum acoustics that combines large couplings, considerable coherence times, and excellent control over the mechanical mode structure.

Errors that violate this model are crosstalk errors. Next, we give an equivalent but purely operational (model-independent) definition of crosstalk errors. Using this definition, we construct a protocol for detecting a large class of crosstalk errors in a multi-qubit processor by finding conditional dependencies between observed experimental probabilities.

In this letter, we investigate the connection between AGN activity and ram pressure in a fully cosmological setting for the first time using the RomulusC simulation, one of the highest resolution simulations of a galaxy cluster to date. We find unambiguous morphological evidence for ram pressure stripping. For lower mass galaxies (with stellar masses < 109.5 solar masses) both star formation and black hole accretion are suppressed by ram pressure before they reach pericenter, whereas for more massive galaxies accretion onto the black hole is enhanced during pericentric passage. Our analysis also indicates that as long as the galaxy retains gas, AGN with higher Eddington ratios are more likely to be the found in galaxies experiencing higher ram pressure. We conclude that prior to quenching star formation, ram pressure triggers enhanced accretion onto the black hole, which then produces heating and outflows due to AGN feedback. AGN feedback may in turn serve to aid in the quenching of star formation in tandem with ram pressure.",20,[],1

We develop a hydrodynamic and radiative model to explore the detectability of equation sub-relativistic meteors. We find that a large fraction of the meteor energy during its passage through the Earth's upper atmosphere powers the adiabatic expansion of a hot plasma cylinder, giving rise to acoustic shocks detectable by infrasound microphones. Additionally, a global network of several hundred all-sky optical cameras with a time resolution of equation would be capable of detecting equation sub-relativistic meteors.",20,[],1
2002.00150,astro-ph,"In order to test a possible evolutionary scenario of high-equation compact quiescent galaxies (cQGs) that they can survive as local compact cores embedded in local massive galaxies with different morphology classes, we explore the star formation histories of local compact cores according to their spectral analysis. We build a sample of 182 massive galaxies with compact cores (equation) at equation from SDSS DR7 spectroscopic catalogue. STARLIGHT package is used to analyze the median stacked spectra and derive the stellar ages and metallicities. Our main results show that local compact cores have the average age of about equation Gyr, indicating their early formation at equation, which is consistent with the formation redshifts of cQGs at equation. Together with previous studies, our result that local compact cores have similar formation redshifts as those of high-equation cQGs, supports that local massive galaxies with compact cores are possible descendants of cQGs. Morphological study of local galaxies with compact cores suggests that there would be multiple possible evolutionary paths for high-equation cQGs: most of them (equation) will evolve into local massive ETGs according to dry minor merger, while some of them (equation) will build a substantial stellar/gas discs according to the late-time gas accretion and sustaining star formation, and finally grow up to spiral galaxies.",20,[],1

We employ up-to-date datasets for both the visible (baryonic) component of the Milky Way, and for the tracers of the gravitational potential (the Rotation Curve).

The exceptional abundances of hydrogen observed in these stars may be the result of accretion of water-rich rocky bodies. We obtained far-ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy of WD J204713.76-125908.9 using the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph on-board the Hubble Space Telescope and X-shooter on the Very Large Telescope, and identify photospheric absorption lines of nine metals: C, O, Mg, Si, P, S, Ca, Fe and Ni. The abundance ratios are consistent with the steady state accretion of exo-planetesimal debris rich in the volatile elements carbon and oxygen, and the transitional element sulphur, by factors of seventeen, two, and four respectively compared to bulk Earth. The parent body has a composition akin to Solar System carbonaceous chondrites, and the inferred minimum mass, equation g, is comparable to an asteroid 23 km in radius. We model the composition of the disrupted parent body, finding from our simulations a median water mass fraction of eight per cent.",20,[],1
2001.04681,astro-ph,"Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have long been known to be variable, but the amplitude, timescale and nature of these changes can often differ dramatically from object to object. The richest source of information about the properties of AGN and the physical processes driving these remains the optical spectrum. While this spectrum has remained remarkably steady over decades for some AGN, other objects, referred to as Changing Look AGN, have experienced a comprehensive spectral transformation. Developments in the detection technology have enabled detailed probing in other wavebands, highlighting for example often quite different variability patterns for high energy emission. This paper explores the current characteristics of some long-known (and almost forgotten) Seyfert galaxies. It compares their present optical spectral properties, determined from recent observations at the South African Astronomical Observatory, with those from much earlier epochs. It furthermore considers the implication of the changes that have taken place, alternatively the endurance of specific spectral features, on our understanding of the mechanisms of the observed targets in particular, and on AGN models in general.",20,[],1
2010.11435,astro-ph,"Astrometry and spectroscopy of the S-stars in the Galactic Center provide a unique way to probe the properties of the central supermassive black hole, as well as the post-Newtonian effects caused by its gravity, e.g. gravitational redshift and general relativistic precession. It has also been suggested that the photometry of S-stars can be used for studying the properties of gaseous environment of Sgr A*. Due to the high velocities of the S-stars, sometimes approaching ~0.1c, their photometric signal should be considerably affected by the Doppler boosting. We calculate this relativistic effect for several S-stars known to closely approach the central black hole (most of them recently announced) and show that the amplitude of the photometric variability due to the Doppler boosting for some of them (S62 and S4714) exceeds 6%; for the well studied star S2 it is about 2%. Measurement of the Doppler boosting can help refine orbital parameters of the S-stars with noisy spectroscopy and astrometry. This effect should also be explicitly accounted for when the photometry of S-stars is used for probing the medium around the Sgr A*. We discuss the observability of the Doppler boosting given the complications typical for the Galactic Center and conclude, in particular, that the purely photometric detection of the higher order relativistic corrections to the Doppler boosting signal (due to the gravitational redshift and transverse Doppler shift, which we also calculate) is hardly possible for the S-stars.",20,[],1
2003.01738,astro-ph,"We develop simple, physically motivated models for drag-induced dust-gas streaming instabilities, which are thought to be crucial for clumping grains to form planetesimals in protoplanetary disks. The models explain, based on the physics of gaseous epicyclic motion and dust-gas drag forces, the most important features of the streaming instability and its simple generalisation, the disk settling instability. Some of the key properties explained by our models include the sudden change in the growth rate of the streaming instability when the dust-to-gas-mass ratio surpasses one, the slow growth rate of the streaming instability compared to the settling instability for smaller grains, and the main physical processes underlying the growth of the most unstable modes in different regimes. As well as providing helpful simplified pictures for understanding the operation of an interesting and fundamental astrophysical fluid instability, our models may prove useful for analysing simulations and developing nonlinear theories of planetesimal growth in disks.",20,[],1
2004.01666,astro-ph,"The significant increase in precision that will be achieved by Stage IV cosmic shear surveys means that several currently used theoretical approximations may cease to be valid. An additional layer of complexity arises from the fact that many of these approximations are interdependent; the procedure to correct for one involves making another. Two such approximations that must be relaxed for upcoming experiments are the reduced shear approximation and the effect of neglecting magnification bias. Accomplishing this involves the calculation of the convergence bispectrum; typically subject to the Limber approximation. In this work, we compute the post-Limber convergence bispectrum, and the post-Limber reduced shear and magnification bias corrections to the angular power spectrum for a Euclid-like survey. We find that the Limber approximation significantly overestimates the bispectrum when any side of the bispectrum triangle, equation. However, the resulting changes in the reduced shear and magnification bias corrections are well below the sample variance for equation. We also compute a worst-case scenario for the additional biases on equationCDM cosmological parameters that result from the difference between the post-Limber and Limber approximated forms of the corrections. These further demonstrate that the reduced shear and magnification bias corrections can safely be treated under the Limber approximation for upcoming surveys.",20,[],1
2011.09869,astro-ph,"We present a detailed modeling and computation methodology to determine the optical Cherenkov signals produced by upward-moving extensive air showers (EASs) induced by equation-leptons and muons, sourced from the interaction of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos interacting in the Earth. Following and extending the physics modeling and Cherenkov signal simulations performed in arxiv:1902.11287, this scheme encompasses a new, state-of-the-art computation of the muon neutrino propagation inside the Earth and the contribution to the equation-lepton muon decay channel. The modeling takes into account all possible equation-lepton decay and muon energy loss channels that feed the optical Cherenkov emission, produced by both tau and muon initiated EASs. The EAS modeling uses the electron energy, angular, and lateral distributions in the EAS and their evolution as well as the wavelength dependence of the Cherenkov emission and its atmospheric attenuation. The results presented here are focused on the detection capabilities of sub-orbital (balloon-borne) and orbital (satellite) based instruments. The latter case was calculated for POEMMA to compare to that presented in arxiv:1902.11287, specifically including the muon-decay channel of equation-leptons and the muonic EAS Cherenkov signal from muon neutrino interactions in the Earth. By detailing all these individual contributions to the optical Cherenkov emission and detection, we show how the ensemble that includes muonic channels provides a large detection capability for space-based, high-energy cosmic neutrino detection. Specifically, we show that for neutrino energies equation 10 PeV, the upward-EAS sensitivity due to muon neutrino interactions in the Earth begin to dominate over that for tau neutrino interactions, effectively extending the neutrino sensitivity to lower energies.",20,[],1

These nodes are supported by a liquid-cooling system which allows continuous operation with modest power consumption and in all but the most adverse conditions.

2010.13503,astro-ph,"B-fields are predicted to play a role in the formation of filamentary structures and their fragmentation process. We aim at investigating the role of the B-field in the process of core fragmentation toward the hub-filament systems in the IRDC G14.2, which present different fragmentation level. We performed observations of the thermal dust polarization at 350 letterm using the CSO toward the hubs. We applied the polarization--intensity-gradient method to estimate the significance of the B-field over the G-force. The B-field in Hub-N shows a uniform structure along the E-W orientation, perpendicular to the major axis of the hub-filament system. The I-gradient in Hub-N displays a local minimum coinciding with the dust core MM1a detected with interferometric observations. The B-field orientation is perturbed when approaching the dust core. Hub-S shows 2 local minima, reflecting the bimodal distribution of the B-field. In Hub-N, both E and W of the hub-filament system, the I-gradient and the B-field are parallel whereas they tend to be perpendicular when penetrating the filaments and hub. The analysis of the letter- and letter B-maps indicate that, the B-field cannot prevent the collapse, suggesting that the B-field is initially dragged by the infalling motion and aligned with it, or is channeling material toward the central ridge from both sides. Values of letter B > 1 are found toward a N-S ridge encompassing the dust emission peak, indicating that in this region B-field dominates over G-force, or that with the current angular resolution we cannot resolve an hypothetical more complex structure. We estimated the B-field strength, the MtF ratio and the A-M number, and found differences between the 2 hubs. The different levels of fragmentation observed in these 2 hubs could arise from the differences in the B-field properties rather than from different intensity of the G-field.",20,[],1
2003.13697,astro-ph,"Building on our previous hydrodynamic study of the angular momenta of cloud cores formed during gravitational collapse of star-forming molecular gas in our previous work, we now examine core properties assuming ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Using the same sink-patch implementation for the \emphAthena MHD code, we characterize the statistical properties of cores, including the mass accretion rates, specific angular momenta, and alignments between the magnetic field and the spin axis of the core on the equation scale. Our simulations, which reproduce the observed relation between magnetic field strength and gas density, show that magnetic fields can help collimate low density flows and help seed the locations of filamentary structures. Consistent with our previous purely hydrodynamic simulations, stars (sinks) form within the heterogeneous environments of filaments, such that accretion onto cores is highly episodic leading to short-term variability but no long-term monotonic growth of the specific angular momenta. With statistical characterization of protostellar cores properties and behaviors, we aim to provide a starting point for building more realistic and self-consistent disk formation models, helping to address whether magnetic fields can prevent the development of (large) circumstellar disks in the ideal MHD limit.",20,[],1
2007.07263,astro-ph,"The binary fraction of a stellar population can have pronounced effects on its properties, and in particular the number counts of different massive star types, and the relative subtype rates of the supernovae which end their lives. Here we use binary population synthesis models with a binary fraction that varies with initial mass to test the effects on resolved stellar populations and supernovae, and ask whether these can constrain the poorly-known binary fraction in different mass and metallicity regimes. We show that Wolf-Rayet star subtype ratios are valuable binary diagnostics, but require large samples to distinguish by models. Uncertainties in which stellar models would be spectroscopically classified as Wolf-Rayet stars are explored. The ratio of thermonuclear, stripped envelope and other core-collapse supernovae may prove a more accessible test and upcoming surveys will be sufficient to constrain both the high mass and low mass binary fraction in the z < 1 galaxy population.",20,[],1
2004.04363,astro-ph,"We measure the gas disc thicknesses of the edge-on galaxy NGC 4013 and the less edge-on galaxies (NGC 4157 and 5907) using CO (CARMA/OVRO) and/or HI (EVLA) observations. We also estimate the scale heights of stars and/or the star formation rate (SFR) for our sample of five galaxies using Spitzer IR data (3.6 equationm and 24 equationm). We derive the average volume densities of the gas and the SFR using the measured scale heights along with radial surface density profiles. Using the volume density that is more physically relevant to the SFR than the surface density, we investigate the existence of a volumetric star formation law (SFL), how the volumetric SFL is different from the surface-density SFL, and how the gas pressure regulates the SFR based on our galaxy sample. We find that the volumetric and surface SFLs in terms of the total gas have significantly different slopes, while the volumetric and surface SFLs in terms of the molecular gas do not show any noticeable difference. The volumetric SFL for the total gas has a flatter power-law slope of 1.26 with a smaller scatter of 0.19 dex compared to the slope (2.05) and the scatter (0.25 dex) of the surface SFL. The molecular gas SFLs have similar slopes of 0.78 (volume density) and 0.77 (surface density) with the same rms scatter. We show that the interstellar gas pressure is strongly correlated with the SFR but find no significant difference between the correlations based on the volume and surface densities.",20,[],1

2009.05249,astro-ph,"We present an analysis of multi-wavelength observations of an area of 0.27 deg x 0.27 deg around the Galactic HII region G18.88-0.49, which is powered by an O-type star (age ~105 years). The Herschel column density map reveals a shell-like feature of extension ~12 pc x 7 pc and mass ~2.9 x 104 Msun around the HII region; its existence is further confirmed by the distribution of molecular (12CO, 13CO, C18O, and NH3) gas at [60, 70] km/s. Four subregions are studied toward this shell-like feature, and show a mass range of ~0.8-10.5 x 103 Msun. These subregions associated with dense gas are dominated by non-thermal pressure and supersonic non-thermal motions. The shell-like feature is associated with the HII region, Class I protostars, and a massive protostar candidate, illustrating the ongoing early phases of star formation (including massive stars). The massive protostar is found toward the position of the 6.7 GHz methanol maser, and is associated with outflow activity. Five parsec-scale filaments are identified in the column density and molecular maps, and appear to be radially directed to the dense parts of the shell-like feature. This configuration is referred to as a ""hub-filament"" system. Significant velocity gradients (0.8-1.8 km/s/pc) are observed along each filament, suggesting that the molecular gas flows towards the central hub along the filaments. Overall, our observational findings favor a global non-isotropic collapse scenario as discussed in Motte et al.

We demonstrate our method for a Fundamental Plane-based survey. The essence of our approach is to work closely with observables (e.g. angular size, surface brightness, redshift, etc), through which we bypass the use of summary statistics by working with the probability distributions. The hierarchical approach improves upon the usual analysis in several ways. In particular, it allows a consistent analysis without having to make prior assumptions about cosmology during the calibration phase. Moreover, calibration uncertainties are correctly accounted for in parameter estimation. Results are presented for a new, fully analytic posterior marginalised over all latent variables, which we expect to allow for more principled analyses in upcoming surveys.

2011.02125,astro-ph,"We report a large-scale (equation) X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ)-bright diffuse enhancement toward M31, which might be a Local Hot Bridge connecting the Milky Way (MW) with M31. We subtract the Galactic emission from the all-sky O VII and O VIII emission line measurement survey, and find that the emission of these two ions is enhanced within equation around M31. The mean emission enhancements are equation L.U., and equation L.U. for O VII and O VIII, respectively (equation for both ions). We also extract the SZ signal around M31, which suggests a surface brightness equation of equation, an enhancement equation (and a best fit of equation). These three measurements trace the hot gas with a temperature equation, showing similar plateau shapes (flat within equation, and zero beyond equation). A single-phase assumption leads to a temperature of equation, which is determined by the O VII/O VIII line ratio. Combining X-ray and SZ measurements, we suggest that this feature is unlikely to be the hot halo around M31 (too massive) or in the MW (too high pressure and X-ray bright). The plateau shape may be explained by a cylinder connecting the MW and M31 (the Local Hot Bridge). We constrain its length to be about 400 kpc, with a radius of 120 kpc, a density of equation, and a metallicity of equation.

2004.10752,astro-ph,"The origin of radio relics is usually explained via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) or re-acceleration of electrons at/from merger shocks in galaxy clusters.

In this Letter we present the discovery of a new giant radio relic around the galaxy cluster Abell 2249 (equation) using LOFAR. It is special since it has the lowest surface brightness of all known radio relics. We study its radio and X-ray properties combinig LOFAR data with uGMRT, JVLA and XMM.

2005.09682,astro-ph,"Stellar variability is driven by a multitude of internal physical processes that depend on fundamental stellar properties. These properties are our bridge to reconciling stellar observations with stellar physics, and for understanding the distribution of stellar populations within the context of galaxy formation. Numerous ongoing and upcoming missions are charting brightness fluctuations of stars over time, which encode information about physical processes such as rotation period, evolutionary state (such as effective temperature and surface gravity), and mass (via asteroseismic parameters). Here, we explore how well we can predict these stellar properties, across different evolutionary states, using only photometric time series data. To do this, we implement a convolutional neural network, and with data-driven modeling we predict stellar properties from light curves of various baselines and cadences. Based on a single quarter of \textitKepler data, we recover stellar properties, including surface gravity for red giant stars (with an uncertainty of equation 0.06 dex), and rotation period for main sequence stars (with an uncertainty of equation 5.2 days, and unbiased from equation5 to 40 days). Shortening the \textitKepler data to a 27-day TESS-like baseline, we recover stellar properties with a small decrease in precision, equation0.07 dex for log equation and equation5.5 days for equation, unbiased from equation5 to 35 days. Our flexible data-driven approach leverages the full information content of the data, requires minimal feature engineering, and can be generalized to other surveys and datasets.

2001.03504,astro-ph,"Using a suite of fully relativistic hydrodynamic simulations applied to main-sequence stars with realistic internal density profiles, we examine full and partial tidal disruptions across a wide range of black hole mass (equation) and stellar mass (equation) as larger equation leads to stronger relativistic effects. For fixed equation, as equation increases, the ratio of the maximum pericenter distance yielding full disruptions (equation) to its Newtonian prediction rises rapidly, becoming triple the Newtonian value for equation, while the ratio of the energy width of the stellar debris for full disruptions to the Newtonian prediction decreases steeply, resulting in a factor of two correction at equation. We find that for partial disruptions, the fractional remnant mass for a given ratio of the pericenter to equation is higher for larger equation. These results have several implications. As equation increases above equation, the cross section for complete disruptions is suppressed by competition with direct capture. However, the cross section ratio for partial to complete disruptions depends only weakly on equation. The relativistic correction to the debris energy width delays the time of peak mass-return rate and diminishes the magnitude of the peak return rate. For equation, the equation-dependence of the full disruption cross section and the peak mass-return rate and time is influenced more by relativistic effects than by Newtonian dynamics.",20,[],1
2009.01991,astro-ph,"Bayesian evidence ratios give a very attractive way of comparing models, and being able to quote the odds on a particular model seems a very clear motivation for making a choice. Jeffreys' scale of evidence is often used in the interpretation of evidence ratios. A natural question is, how often will you get it right when you choose on the basis of some threshold value of the evidence ratio? The evidence ratio will be different in different realizations of the data, and its utility can be examined in a Neyman-Pearson like way to see what the trade-offs are between statistical power (the chance of 'getting it right') versus the false alarm rate, picking the alternative hypothesis when the null is actually true. I will show some simple examples which show that there can be a surprisingly large range for an evidence ratio under different realizations of the data. It seems best not to simply rely on Jeffrey's scale when decisions have to be taken, but also to examine the probability of taking the 'wrong' decision if some evidence ratio is taken to be decisive.

We identify a WISE infrared excess in SDSS J15050659 that we believe to be the first direct detection of an AM CVn donor star in a non-direct impacting binary. The mass ratio of SDSS J15050659 is consistent with a white dwarf donor. CRTS J1028-0819 has an orbital period of 52.1 min, the shortest period of any helium cataclysmic variable. MOA 2010-BLG-087 is co-aligned with a K-class star that dominates its spectrum. ASASSN-14ei and ASASSN-14mv both show a remarkable number of echo outbursts following superoutbursts (13 and 10 echo outbursts respectively). ASASSN-14ei shows an increased outburst rate over the years following its superoutburst, perhaps resulting from an increased accretion rate.",20,[],1
2001.10547,astro-ph,"Recent stacked ALMA observations have revealed that normal, star-forming galaxies at equation are surrounded by extended (equation) [CII] emitting halos which are not predicted by the most advanced, zoom-in simulations. We present a model in which these halos are the result of supernova-driven cooling outflows. Our model contains two free parameters, the outflow mass loading factor, equation, and the parent galaxy dark matter halo circular velocity, equation. The outflow model successfully matches the observed [CII] surface brightness profile if equation and equation, corresponding to a dynamical mass of equation. The predicted outflow rate and velocity range are equation and equation, respectively. We conclude that: (a) extended halos can be produced by cooling outflows; (b) the large equation value is marginally consistent with starburst-driven outflows, but it might indicate additional energy input from AGN; (c) the presence of [CII] halos requires an ionizing photon escape fraction from galaxies equation. The model can be readily applied also to individual high-equation galaxies, as those observed, e.g., by the ALMA ALPINE survey now becoming available.",20,[],1
2006.03603,astro-ph,"The zero point of the reddening toward the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has been the subject of some dispute. Its uncertainty propagates as a systematic error for methods which measure the extragalactic distance scale through knowledge of the absolute extinction of LMC stars. In an effort to resolve this issue, we used three different methods to calibrate the most commonly used metric to predict LMC extinction, the intrinsic color of the red clump, equation. The first approach was to empirically calibrate the color zeropoints of the BaSTI isochrones over a wide metallicity range of equation using measurements of red clump stars in 47 Tuc, the Solar Neighborhood, and NGC 6791. From these efforts we also measure these properties of the Solar Neighborhood red clump, (equation, equation, equation, equation, equation, equation, equation, equation)equation (1.02, 2.75, 2.18, 1.52, 0.64, 0.15, equation0.23, equation1.63). The second and third methods were to compare the observed colors of the red clump to those of Cepheids and RR Lyrae in the LMC which are standardizable crayons based on their periods and metallicities. With these three methods, we estimated the intrinsic color of the red clump of the LMC to be equation respectively, and similarly using the first and third method we estimated equation respectively for the Small Magellanic Cloud. We estimate the luminosities to be equation and equation. We show that this has important implications for recent calibrations of the tip of the red giant branch in the Magellanic Clouds used to measure equation.",20,[],1
2002.02498,astro-ph,"We explore the galaxy structure of four tidal disruption event (TDE) host galaxies on 30 pc to kpc scales using HST WFC3 multi-band imaging. The star formation histories of these hosts are diverse, including one post-starburst galaxy (ASASSN-14li), two hosts with recent weak starbursts (ASASSN-14ae and iPTF15af), and one early type (PTF09ge). Compared to early type galaxies of similar stellar masses, the TDE hosts have higher central surface brightnesses and stellar mass surface densities on 30-100 pc scales. The TDE hosts do not show the large, kpc-scale tidal disruptions seen in some post-starburst galaxies; the hosts have low morphological asymmetries similar to those of early type galaxies. The lack of strong asymmetries are inconsistent with a recent major (~1:1 mass) merger, although minor (equation1:3) mergers are possible. Given the time elapsed since the end of the starbursts in the three post-burst TDE hosts and the constraints on the merger mass ratios, it is unlikely that a bound supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) has had time to coalesce. The TDE hosts have low central (<140 pc) ellipticities compared to early type galaxies. The low central ellipticities disfavor a strong radial anisotropy as the cause for the enhanced TDE rate, although we cannot rule out eccentric disks at the scale of the black hole gravitational radius of influence (~1 pc). These observations suggest that the high central stellar densities are a more important driver than SMBHBs or radial anisotropies in increasing the TDE rate in galaxies with recent starbursts.",20,[],1
2004.09510,astro-ph,"We present the luminosity function (LF) for ultraluminous Lyequation emitting galaxies (LAEs) at z = 6.6. We define ultraluminous LAEs (ULLAEs) as galaxies with logL(Lyequation) > 43.5 erg sequation. We select our main sample using the g', r', i', z', and NB921 observations of a wide-area (30 degequation) Hyper Suprime-Cam survey of the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) field. We select candidates with g', r', i' > 26, NB921 equation 23.5, and NB921 - z' equation 1.3. Using the DEIMOS spectrograph on Keck II, we confirm 9 of our 14 candidates as ULLAEs at z = 6.6 and the remaining 5 as an AGN at z = 6.6, two [OIII]equation5007 emitting galaxies at z = 0.84 and z = 0.85, and two non-detections. This emphasizes the need for full spectroscopic follow-up to determine accurate LFs. In constructing the ULLAE LF at z = 6.6, we combine our 9 NEP ULLAEs with two previously discovered and confirmed ULLAEs in the COSMOS field: CR7 and COLA1. We apply rigorous corrections for incompleteness based on simulations. We compare our ULLAE LF at z = 6.6 with LFs at z = 5.7 and z = 6.6 from the literature. Our data reject some previous LF normalizations and power law indices, but they are broadly consistent with others. Indeed, a comparative analysis of the different literature LFs suggests that none is fully consistent with any of the others, making it critical to determine the evolution from z = 5.7 to z = 6.6 using LFs constructed in exactly the same way at both redshifts.",20,[],1
2008.07205,astro-ph,"We explore the influence of non-axisymmetric modes on the dynamics of the collapsed core of rotating, magnetised high-mass stars in three-dimensional simulations of a rapidly rotating star with an initial mass of equation endowed with four different pre-collapse configurations of the magnetic field, ranging from moderate to very strong field strength and including the field predicted by the stellar evolution model. The model with the weakest magnetic field achieves shock revival due to neutrino heating in a gain layer characterised by a large-scale, hydrodynamic equation spiral mode. Later on, the growing magnetic field of the proto neutron star launches weak outflows into the early ejecta. Their orientation follows the evolution of the rotational axis of the proto neutron star, which starts to tilt from the original orientation due to the asymmetric accretion flows impinging on its surface. The models with stronger magnetisation generate mildly relativistic, magnetically driven polar outflows propagating over a distance of equation km within a few 100 ms. These jets are stabilised against disruptive non-axisymmetric instabilities by their fast propagation and by the shear of their toroidal magnetic field. Within the simulation times of around 1 s, the explosions reach moderate energies and the growth of the proto neutron star masses ceases at values substantially below the threshold for black hole formation, which, in combination with the high rotational energies, might suggest a possible later proto-magnetar activity.",20,[],1

The dark energy equation of state parameter (EoS) is varying in time and is parameterized by its adiabatic sound speed. Such model of interacting dark energy has advantages over model with constant EoS, because it avoids non-adiabatic instabilities of dark energy at radiation dominated epoch for certain types of interaction in dark sector. The stability conditions for solutions of equations of dark energy perturbations were derived. The impact of strength of additional interaction between dark components on the evolution of density and velocity perturbations in them is analysed for quintessence and phantom types of dark energy.",20,[],1
2001.08282,astro-ph,"Ultra-short-period planets (USPs) provide important clues to planetary formation and migration. Recently, it is found that the mutual inclinations of the planetary systems are larger if the inner orbits are closer (equation) and if the planetary period ratios are larger (equation) (Dai et al. 2018). This suggests that the USPs experienced both inclination excitation and orbital shrinkage. Here we investigate the increase in the mutual inclination due to stellar oblateness. We find that the stellar oblateness (within equationGyr) is sufficient to enhance the mutual inclination to explain the observed signatures. This suggests that the USPs can migrate closer to the host star in a near coplanar configuration with their planetary companions (e.g., disk migrationtides or in-situtides), before mutual inclination gets excited due to stellar oblateness.",20,[],1
2008.01094,astro-ph,"Ultra-wide triple black-holes (TBHs; with an outer orbit equation AU) in the field can be considerably perturbed by flyby encounters with field stars by the excitation of the outer orbit eccentricities. We study the cumulative effect of such flybys, and show them to be conductive for the production of gravitational-wave (GW) sources. Flyby encounters with TBHs can turn the TBHs unstable and follow chaotic evolution. This leads to a binary-single resonant encounter between the outer BH and the inner-binary. These encounters can result in either a prompt GW-merger of two of the TBH components during the resonant phase, or the disruption of the TBH. In the latter case a more compact binary is left behind, while the third BH escapes and is ejected. The compact remnant binary may still inspiral through GW-emission, although on longer timescales. A significant number of these would lead to a delayed GW-merger in less than a Hubble time. We find a volumetric merger rate of equation contributed by the (former) prompt-merger TBH channel and equation contributed by the (latter) delayed-merger TBH channel. The prompt channel gives rise to eccentric mergers in the aLIGO band, while the majority of the delayed-GW mergers are circularized when enter the aLIGO band. We find the total \rm eccentric volumetric merger rate to be equation from both channels. We expect these mergers to show no significant spin-orbit alignment, and uniform delay time distribution.",20,[],1

We produced V-band light curves for a total of equation million sources and systematically searched these sources for variability. We identified equation variables, including equation new discoveries. Most (equation) of our discoveries are in the Southern hemisphere. Here we use spectroscopic information from LAMOST, GALAH, RAVE, and APOGEE to study the physical and chemical properties of these variables. We find that metal-poor eclipsing binaries have orbital periods that are shorter than metal-rich systems at fixed temperature. We identified rotational variables on the main-sequence, red giant branch and the red clump. A substantial fraction (equation) of the rotating giants have large equation or large NUV excesses also indicative of fast rotation. The rotational variables have unusual abundances suggestive of analysis problems. Semi-regular variables tend to be lower metallicity (equation) than most giant stars. We find that the APOGEE DR16 temperatures of oxygen-rich semi-regular variables are strongly correlated with the equation color index for equation K. Using abundance measurements from APOGEE DR16, we find evidence for Mg, O and N enrichment in the semi-regular variables.

2005.14155,astro-ph,"ASTERIA (Arcsecond Space Telescope Enabling Research In Astrophysics) is a 6U CubeSat space telescope (10 cm x 20 cm x 30 cm, 10 kg). ASTERIA's primary mission objective was demonstrating two key technologies for reducing systematic noise in photometric observations: high-precision pointing control and high-stabilty thermal control. ASTERIA demonstrated 0.5 arcsecond RMS pointing stability and equation10 milliKelvin thermal control of its camera payload during its primary mission, a significant improvement in pointing and thermal performance compared to other spacecraft in ASTERIA's size and mass class. ASTERIA launched in August 2017 and deployed from the International Space Station (ISS) November 2017. During the prime mission (November 2017 -- February 2018) and the first extended mission that followed (March 2018 - May 2018), ASTERIA conducted opportunistic science observations which included collection of photometric data on 55 Cancri, a nearby exoplanetary system with a super-Earth transiting planet. The 55 Cancri data were reduced using a custom pipeline to correct CMOS detector column-dependent gain variations. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach was used to simultaneously detrend the photometry using a simple baseline model and fit a transit model. ASTERIA made a marginal detection of the known transiting exoplanet 55 Cancri e (equation~\Rearth), measuring a transit depth of equation ppm.

In particular, non-physical bumpy distributions appear when turbulence is purely diffusive. This excludes very short correlation times for real discs, as predicted by numerical simulations.",20,[],1
2011.06001,astro-ph,"The Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) is a low-frequency radio continuum survey of the Northern sky at an unparalleled resolution and sensitivity. In order to fully exploit this huge dataset and those produced by the Square Kilometre Array in the next decade, automated methods in machine learning and data-mining will be increasingly essential both for morphological classifications and for identifying optical counterparts to the radio sources. Using self-organising maps (SOMs), a form of unsupervised machine learning, we created a dimensionality reduction of the radio morphologies for the equation25k extended radio continuum sources in the LoTSS first data release, which is only equation2 percent of the final LoTSS survey. We made use of \textscPINK, a code which extends the SOM algorithm with rotation and flipping invariance, increasing its suitability and effectiveness for training on astronomical sources. After training, the SOMs can be used for a wide range of science exploitation and we present an illustration of their potential by finding an arbitrary number of morphologically rare sources in our training data (424 square degrees) and subsequently in an area of the sky (equation5300 square degrees) outside the training data. Objects found in this way span a wide range of morphological and physical categories: extended jets of radio active galactic nuclei, diffuse cluster haloes and relics, and nearby spiral galaxies.

2009.07559,astro-ph,"Space surveillance by radar is especially used for the low Earth orbit to maintain a database, also called catalogue, of objects on orbit. Among others, surveillance radars which are constantly scanning a region of interest in the sky are used for this purpose. The detections from such a radar which cannot be assigned to an already known catalogue object might not contain enough information to obtain a reliable initial orbit for a new catalogue entry from a single measured pass, also called tracklet. Instead, two tracklets can be combined to improve the quality of the initial orbit which leads to the correlation problem. This means that it has to be tested whether two tracklets belong to the same object and an initial orbit has to be derived by combining the tracklets. A common approach to condense the information in the tracklet is fitting them with so-called attributables. Because radar observations include different types of observables, the fitting of these attributables has to be considered as an important part of the entire correlation process. This paper analyses the effect of the attributable fitting considering the achieved accuracy and influence on the tracklet correlation. A new singularity-free coordinate system is introduced, which improves the results of the fitting and correlation. Finally, a test on a simulated survey scenario introduces two additional filters to remove false positive correlations. It is shown that the attributable-based approach can be applied successfully to tracklets of up to three minutes length with different detection frequencies.",20,[],1

In the case of FRB 180916.J015865 the primary is an early OB-type star with mass loss rate equation yrequation, and the secondary a neutron star. The observed periodicity is not intrinsic to the FRB's source, but is due to the orbital phase-dependent modulation of the absorption conditions in the massive star's wind. The observed relatively narrow FRB activity window implies that the primary's wind dynamically dominates that of the pulsar, equation, where equation is pulsar spin-down, equation is the primary's wind mass loss rate and equation is its velocity.

2011.05903,astro-ph,"We investigate the dust growth in oxygen-rich stellar outflows for a set of nine well-observed massive supergiants with optically thin dust shells. Models of the infrared emission from their circumstellar dust shells are compared to their observed infrared spectra so as to derive the essential parameters that govern dust formation in the extended envelope of these stars. The results obtained from the comparative study are also compared with the predictions of a model for silicate dust condensation solely based on laboratory data and basic stellar properties. The infrared emission in the wavelength range between 6 and 25 mu can be reproduced rather well by a mixture of non-stoichiometric iron-bearing silicates, alumina, and metallic iron dust particles for all nine objects. The observed spectra obtained from three objects, mu Cep, RW Cyg, and RS Per, can be reproduced by a stationary and (essentially) spherically symmetric outflow which enables a direct comparison with predictions from a theoretical dust growth model. The temperature at the onset of massive silicate dust growth is of the order of 920 K and the corresponding outflow velocity of the order of the sound velocity for these objects. The condensation temperature suggests that the silicate dust grows on the corundum dust grains that are formed well in the interior of the silicate dust shell at a much higher temperature. Our results propose that regarding the two major problems of dust formation in stellar outflows: (i) formation of seed nuclei; (ii) their growth to macroscopic dust grains, we are gradually coming close to a quantitative understanding of the second item.",20,[],1
2009.10258,astro-ph,"Owing to narrow energy band of \textitSwift/BAT, several urgent issues are required to pay more attentions but unsolved so far. We systematically study the properties of a refined sample of 283 \textitSwift/BAT gamma-ray bursts with well-measured spectral peak energy (equation) at a high confidence level larger than 3equation. It is interestingly found that duration (equation) distribution of \textitSwift bursts still exhibits an evident bimodality with a more reliable boundary of equation1.06 s instead of 2 s for previously contaminated samples including bursts without well-peaked spectra, which is very close to equation1.27 s and equation0.8 s suggested by some authors for Fermi/GBM and \textitSwift/BAT catalogs, respectively. The \textitSwift/BAT short and long bursts have comparable mean equation values of equation and equation keV in each, similar to what found for both types of BATSE bursts, which manifests the traditional short-hard/long-soft scheme may not be tenable for the certain energy window of a detector. In statistics, we also investigate the consistency of distinct methods for the equation estimates and find that Bayesian approach and BAND function can always give consistent evaluations. In contrast, the frequently-used cut-off power-law model matches two other methods for lower equation and will overestimate the equation more than 70\% as equation100 keV. Peak energies of X-ray flashes, X-ray rich bursts and classical gamma-ray bursts could have an evolutionary consequence from thermal-dominated to non-thermal-dominated radiation mechanisms.

2010.07796,astro-ph,"The light curve of the fast radio burst (FRB) 181112 is resolved into four successive pulses, and the time interval (equation ms) between the first and third pulses coincides with that between the second and fourth pulses, which can be interpreted as a neutron star (NS) spinning at a period of about equation ms. Although this period is shorter than the most rapidly rotating pulsar currently known (equation ms), it is typical for a simulated massive NS formed immediately after the coalescence of binary neutron stars (BNS). Therefore, a BNS merger is a good candidate for the origin of this FRB if the periodicity is real. We discuss the future implications that can be obtained if such a periodicity is detected from FRBs simultaneously with gravitational waves (GW). The remnant spin period equation inferred from the FRB observation is unique information which is not readily obtained by current GW observations at the post-merger phase. If combined with the mass of the merger remnant equation inferred from GW data, it would set a new constraint on the equation of state of nuclear matter. Furthermore, the post-merger quantity equation, or the tidal deformability of the merger remnant, is closely related to the binary tidal deformability parameter equation of NSs before they merge, and a joint FRB-GW observation will establish a new limit on equation. Thus, if equation is also well measured by GW data, a comparison between these two will provide further insights into the nature of nuclear matter and BNS mergers.",20,[],1

We find many similarities for almost all of the chemical species measured in this work with the chemical patterns of GCs, so we conjecture that they have likely been dynamically ejected into the bulge and inner halo from GCs formed in situ and/or GC formed in different progenitors of known merger events experienced by the MW, such as the \textitGaia-Sausage-Enceladus and/or Sequoia.",20,[],1
2005.03578,astro-ph,"While accreting through a circumstellar disk, young stellar objects are observed to undergo sudden and powerful accretion events known as FUor or EXor outbursts. Although such episodic accretion is considered to be an integral part of the star formation process, the triggers and mechanisms behind them remain uncertain. We conducted global numerical hydrodynamics simulations of protoplanetary disk formation and evolution in the thin-disk limit, assuming both magnetically layered and fully magnetorotational instability (MRI)-active disk structure. In this paper, we characterize the nature of the outbursts occurring in these simulations. The instability in the dead zone of a typical layered disk results in ""MRI outbursts"". We explore their progression and their dependence on the layered disk parameters as well as cloud core mass. The simulations of fully MRI-active disks showed an instability analogous to the classical thermal instability. This instability manifested at two temperatures--above approximately 1400 K and 3500 K--due to the steep dependence of Rosseland opacity on the temperature. The origin of these thermally unstable regions is related to the bump in opacity resulting from molecular absorption by water vapor and may be viewed as a novel mechanism behind some of the shorter duration accretion events. Although we demonstrated local thermal instability in the disk, more investigations are needed to confirm that a large-scale global instability will ensue. We conclude that the magnetic structure of a disk, its composition, as well as the stellar mass, can significantly affect the nature of episodic accretion in young stellar objects.",20,[],1
2003.14044,astro-ph,"We study the angular momentum transport inside the hot Jupiters under the the influences of gravitational and thermal forcing. Due to the strong stellar irradiation, radiative region develops on top of the convective region. Internal gravity waves are launched at the radiative-convective boundaries (RCBs). The thermal response is dynamical and plays an important role in the angular momentum transport. By separating the gravitational and thermal forcing terms, we identify the thermal effects for increasing the angular momentum transport. For the low frequency (in the co-rotating frame with planets) prograde (retrograde) tidal frequency, the angular momentum flux is positive (negative). The tidal interactions tends to drive the planet to the synchronous state. We find that the angular momentum transport associated with the internal gravity wave is very sensitive to relative position between the RCB and the penetration depth of the thermal forcing. If the RCB is in the vicinity of the thermal forcing penetration depth, even with small amplitude thermal forcing, the thermally driven angular momentum flux could be much larger than the flux induced by gravitational forcing. The thermally enhanced torque could drive the planet to the synchronous state in as short as a few equation years.",20,[],1

The majority of galaxies (84%) in this sample are consistent with a zero or slightly positive metallicity gradient across the full mass range probed (8.5 < log M*/Msun < 10.5). We measure the intrinsic population scatter of the metallicity gradients, and show that it increases with decreasing stellar mass---consistent with previous reports in the literature, but confirmed here with a much larger sample. To understand the physical mechanisms governing this scatter, we search for correlations between the observed gradient and various stellar population properties at fixed mass. However, we find no evidence for a correlation with the galaxy properties we consider---including star-formation rates, sizes, star-formation rate surface densities, and star-formation rates per gravitational potential energy.

2003.11590,astro-ph,"A planet's orbital orientation relative to an observer's line of sight determines the chord length for a transiting planet, i.e., the projected distance a transiting planet travels across the stellar disc. For a given circular orbit, the chord length determines the transit duration. Changes in the orbital inclination, the direction of the ascending node, or both, can alter this chord length and thus result in transit duration variations (TDVs). Variation of the full orbital inclination vector can even lead to de-transiting or newly transiting planets for a system. We use Laplace-Lagrange secular theory to estimate the fastest nodal eigenfrequencies for over 100 short-period planetary systems. The highest eigenfrequency is an indicator of which systems should show the strongest TDVs. We further explore five cases (TRAPPIST-1, Kepler-11, K2-138, Kepler-445, and Kepler-334) using direct N-body simulations to characterize possible TDVs and to explore whether de-transiting planets could be possible for these systems. A range of initial conditions are explored, with each realization being consistent with the observed transits. We find that tens of percent of multiplanet systems have fast enough eigenfrequencies to expect large TDVs on decade timescales.

Taking into account the compactness and observer angle values provided by Miller et al. 2019 and Riley et al. 2019, we compute geodesics from the observer plane to the polar caps to compute the resulting X-ray light curve. We explore, through Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques, the detailed magnetic field configurations that can reproduce the observed X-ray light curve and have discovered degeneracies, i.e., diverse field configurations, which can provide sufficient descriptions to the Nicer X-ray waveforms. Having obtained the force-free field structures, we then compute the corresponding gamma-ray light curves following Kalapotharakos et al. 2014; these we compare to those obtained by Fermi, to provide models consistent with both the X-ray and the gamma-ray data, thereby restricting further the multipole field parameters. An essential aspect of this approach is the proper computation of the relative phase between the X- and gamma-ray light curves. We conclude with a discussion of the broader implications of our study.",20,[],1
2007.11336,astro-ph,"Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) are compact binaries with white dwarf (WD) primaries. CVs and other accreting WD binaries (AWBs) are useful laboratories for studying accretion flows, gas dynamics, outflows, transient outbursts, and explosive nuclear burning under different astrophysical plasma conditions. They have been studied over decades and are important for population studies of galactic X-ray sources. Recent space- and ground-based high resolution spectral and timing studies, along with recent surveys indicate that we still have observational and theoretical complexities yet to answer. I review accretion in nonmagnetic AWBs in the light of X-ray observations. I present X-ray diagnostics of accretion in dwarf novae and the disk outbursts, the nova-like systems, and the state of the research on the disk winds and outflows in the nonmagnetic CVs together with comparisons and relations to classical and recurrent nova systems, AM CVns and Symbiotic systems. I discuss how the advective hot accretion flows (ADAF-like) in the inner regions of accretion disks (merged with boundary layer zones) in nonmagnetic CVs explain most of the discrepancies and complexities that have been encountered in the X-ray observations. I stress how flickering variability studies from optical to X-rays can be probes to determine accretion history and disk structure together with how the temporal and spectral variability of CVs are related to that of LMXBs and AGNs. Finally, I discuss the nature of accretion in nonmagnetic WDs in terms of ADAF-like accretion flows, and elaborate on the solutions it brings and its complications, constructing an observational framework to motivate new theoretical calculations that introduce this flow-type in disks, outflow and wind models together with disk-instability models of outbursts and nova outbursts in AWBs and WD physics, in general.",20,[],1
2008.00921,astro-ph,"We have monitored over a ten-year interval the light variations of five evolved stars with very large mid-infrared excesses. All five objects appear to have oxygen-rich or mixed oxygen-rich and carbon-rich chemistries. They all vary in light: four over a small range of equation0.2 mag and the fifth over a larger range of equation0.7 mag. Spectral types range from G2 to B0. Periodic pulsations are found for the first time in the three cooler ones, IRAS 18075equation0924 (123 days), 19207equation2023 (96 days), and 20136equation1309 (142 days). No significant periodicity is found in the hotter ones, but they appear to vary on a shorter time scale of a few days or less. Two also show some evidence of longer-term periodic variations (equation4 yrs). Three appear to be proto-planetary nebulae, in the post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) phase of stellar evolution. Their light variations are in general agreement with the relationships between temperature, pulsation period, and pulsation amplitude found in previously studied PPNe. The other two, however, appear to have too low a luminosity (1000equation1500 Lequation), based on Gaia distances, to be in the post-AGB phase. Instead, they appear to be Milky Way analogues of the recently identified class of dusty post-red giant branch stars found in the Magellanic Clouds, which likely had their evolution interrupted by interaction with a binary companion. If this is the case, then these would be among the first dusty post-RGB objects identified in the Milky Way Galaxy.",20,[],1
2006.11359,astro-ph,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a recent advancement in unsupervised machine learning. They are a cat-and-mouse game between two neural networks: [1] a discriminator network which learns to validate whether a sample is real or fake compared to a training set and [2] a generator network which learns to generate data that appear to belong to the training set. Both networks learn from each other until training is complete and the generator network is able to produce samples that are indistinguishable from the training set. We find that GANs are well-suited for fast generation of novel 3D density maps that are indistinguishable from those obtained from N-body simulations. In a matter of seconds, a fully trained GAN can generate thousands of density maps at different epochs in the history of the universe. These GAN-generated maps can then be used to study the evolution of large-scale structure over time.",20,[],1
2008.11394,astro-ph,"One of the outstanding problems of current observational cosmology is to understand the nature of sources that produced the bulk of the ionizing radiation after the Cosmic Dark Age. Direct detection of these reionization sources is practically infeasible at high redshift due to the steep decline of intergalactic medium transmission. However, a number of low-redshift analogs emitting Lyman continuum at~900 Angstrom ~restframe are now detected at equation and there are detections in the range equation also. Here, we report the detection of Lyman continuum emission with a high escape fraction (>20%) from a low-mass clumpy galaxy at z=1.42, in the middle of the redshift range where no detection has been made before and near the peak of the Cosmic Star-formation history. The observation was made in the Hubble Extreme Deep field by the wide-field Ultra-Violet-Imaging Telescope onboard AstroSat. This is the first detection of Extreme Ultraviolet radiation from a distant galaxy at a rest-frame wavelength of 600 Angstrom, and it opens up a new window to constrain the shape of the ionization spectrum. Further observations with AstroSat should significantly increase the sample of Lyman continuum leaking galaxies at Cosmic Noon.",20,[],1
2001.00903,astro-ph,"Magnetic fields play vital roles in intracluster media (ICMs), but estimating their strengths and distributions from observations is a major challenge. Faraday rotation measures (RMs) are widely applied to this task, so it is critical to understand inherent uncertainties in RM analysis. In this paper, we seek to characterize those uncertainties given the types of information available today, independent of the specific technique used. We conduct synthetic RM observations through the ICM of a galaxy cluster drawn from an MHD cosmological simulation in which the magnetic field is known. We analyze the synthetic RM observations using an analytical formalism based on commonly used model assumptions allowing us to relate model physical variables to outcome uncertainties. Despite the simplicity of some assumptions, and unknown physical parameters, we are able to extract an approximate magnitude of the central magnetic field within an apparently irreducible uncertain factor approximately 3. Principal, largely irreducible, uncertainties come from the unknown depth along the line of sight of embedded polarized sources, the lack of robust coherence lengths from area-constrained polarization sampling, and the unknown scaling between ICM electron density and magnetic field strength. The RM-estimated central magnetic field strengths span more than an order of magnitude including the full range of synthetic experiments.",20,[],1
2004.01432,astro-ph,"With more than 150 blank sky observations at high Galactic latitude, we make a systematic study to the background of the Low Energy Telescope (LE) of the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (dubbed as Insight-HXMT). Both the on-ground simulation and the in-orbit observation indicate that the background spectrum mainly has two components. One is the particle background that dominates above 7 keV and its spectral shape is consistent in every geographical locations. Another is the diffuse X-ray background that dominates below 7 keV and has a stable spectrum less dependent of the sky region. The particle background spectral shape can be obtained from the blind detector data of all the blank sky observations, and the particle background intensity can be measured by the blind detector at 10-12.5 keV. The diffuse X-ray background in the high Galactic latitude can also be obtained from the blank sky spectra after subtracting the particle background. Based on these characteristics, we develop the background model for both the spectrum and the light curve. The systematic error for the background spectrum is investigated with different exposures (Texp). For the spectrum with Texp=1 ks, the average systematic errors in 1-7 keV and 1-10 keV are 4.2% and 3.7%, respectively. We also perform the systematic error analyses of the background light curves with different energy bands and time bins. The results show that the systematic errors for the light curves with different time bins are <8% in 1-10 keV.",20,[],1
2008.04661,astro-ph,"We analytically study the properties of the electromagnetic field in vacuum around close binary compact stars containing at least one neutron star. We show that the orbital motion of the neutron star induces high multipole modes of the electromagnetic field just before the merger. These modes are superimposed to form a spiral arm configuration and its edge is found to be a likely site for magnetic reconnection. These modes also enhance the total Poynting flux from neutron star binaries by a factor of 2--4. We also indicate that the electric field induced by the orbital motion lead to a magnetosphere around binaries and estimate its plasma density, which has a different parameter dependence than Goldreich-Julian density. With these properties, we discuss possible electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events, and identify radio precursors, such as fast radio bursts, as the most promising observational targets.",20,[],1
2008.02533,astro-ph,"WASP-98 is a planetary system containing a hot Jupiter transiting a late-G dwarf. A fainter star 12 arcsec distant has previously been identified as a white dwarf, with a distance and proper motion consistent with a physical association with the planetary system. We present spectroscopy of the white dwarf, with the aim of determining its mass, radius and temperature and hence the age of the system. However, the spectra show the featureless continuum and lack of spectral lines characteristic of the DC class of white dwarfs. We therefore fitted theoretical white dwarf spectra to the ugriz apparent magnitudes and Gaia DR2 parallax of this object in order to determine its physical properties and the age of the system. We find that the system is old, with a lower limit of 3.6 Gyr, but theoretical uncertainties preclude a precise determination of its age. Its kinematics are consistent with membership of the thick disc, but do not allow us to rule out the thin-disc alternative. The old age and low metallicity of the system suggest it is subject to an age-metallicity relation, but analysis of the most metal-rich and metal-poor transiting planetary systems yields only insubstantial evidence of this. We conclude that the study of bound white dwarfs can yield independent ages to planetary systems, but such analysis may be better-suited to DA and DB rather than DC white dwarfs.",20,[],1
2004.04808,astro-ph,"The nature of dark matter sets the timeline for the formation of first collapsed halos and thus affects the sources of reionization. Here, we consider two different models of dark matter: cold dark matter (CDM) and thermal warm dark matter (WDM), and study how they impact the epoch of reionization (EoR) and its 21-cm observables. Using a suite of simulations, we find that in the WDM scenarios, the structure formation on small scales gets suppressed resulting in a smaller number of low mass dark matter halos compared to the CDM scenario. Assuming that the efficiency of sources in producing ionizing photons remain the same, this leads to a lower number of total ionizing photons produced at any given cosmic time and thus in a delay in the reionization process. We also find visual differences in the neutral hydrogen (HI) topology and in 21-cm maps in case of the WDM compared to the CDM. However, differences in the 21-cm power spectra, at the same neutral fraction, are found to be small. Thus, we focus on the non-Gaussianity in the EoR 21-cm signal, quantified through its bispectrum. We find that the 21-cm bispectra (driven by the HI topology) are significantly different in WDM models when compared with CDM, even for same mass averaged neutral fractions. This establishes that the 21-cm bispectrum is a unique and promising way to differentiate between different dark matter models, and can be used to constrain the nature of the dark matter in the future EoR observations.",20,[],1
2011.08867,astro-ph,"Analysis of new precision radial velocity (RV) measurements from the Lick Automated Planet Finder (APF) and Keck HIRES have yielded the discovery of three new exoplanet candidates orbiting two nearby K dwarfs not previously reported to have companions (HD 190007 & HD 216520). We also report new velocities from both the APF and the Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS) for the previously reported planet host stars GJ 686 and HD 180617 and update the corresponding exoplanet orbital models.

2001.07214,astro-ph,"Recent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are able to reproduce numerous statistical properties of galaxies that are consistent with observational data. Yet, the adopted subgrid models strongly affect the simulation outcomes, limiting the predictive power of these simulations. In this work, we perform a suite of isolated galactic disk simulations under the \it SMUGGLE framework and investigate how different subgrid models affect the properties of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We employ \sc astrodendro, a hierarchical clump-finding algorithm, to identify GMCs in the simulations. We find that different choices of subgrid star formation efficiency, equation, and stellar feedback channels, yield dramatically different mass and spatial distributions for the GMC populations. Without feedback, the mass function of GMCs has a shallower power-law slope and extends to higher mass ranges compared to runs with feedback. Moreover, higher equation results in faster molecular gas consumption and steeper mass function slopes. Feedback also suppresses power in the two-point correlation function (TPCF) of the spatial distribution of GMCs. Specifically, radiative feedback strongly reduces the TPCF on scales below 0.2~kpc, while supernova feedback reduces power on scales above 0.2~kpc. Finally, runs with higher equation exhibit a higher TPCF than runs with lower equation, because the dense gas is depleted more efficiently thereby facilitating the formation of well-structured supernova bubbles. We argue that comparing simulated and observed GMC populations can help better constrain subgrid models in the next-generation of galaxy formation simulations.",20,[],1

The first alpha abundances of seven stars in this heavily reddened cluster are presented using APOGEE DR16. A significant spread in the abundances of N, C, Na, and Al indicates the presence of multiple stellar populations in this cluster.

2010.07443,astro-ph,"The SINFONI survey for Unveiling the Physics and Effect of Radiative feedback (SUPER) was designed to conduct a blind search for AGN-driven outflows on X-ray selected AGN at redshift zequation2 with high (equation2 kpc) spatial resolution, and correlate them to the properties of the host galaxy and central black hole. The main aims of this paper are: a) to derive reliable estimates for the BH mass and accretion rates for the Type-1 AGN in this survey; b) to characterize the properties of the AGN driven winds in the BLR. We analyzed rest-frame optical and UV spectra of 21 Type-1 AGN. We found that the BH masses estimated from Hequation and Hequation lines are in agreement. We estimate BH masses in the range Log(Mequation)=8.4-10.8 and Eddington ratios equation =0.04-1.3. We confirm that the CIV line width does not correlate with the Balmer lines and the peak of the line profile is blue-shifted with respect to the [OIII]-based systemic redshift. These findings support the idea that the CIV line is tracing outflowing gas in the BLR, with velocities up to equation4700 km/s. We confirm the strong dependence of the BLR wind velocity with the UV-to-Xray continuum slope, Lequation and equation. We inferred BLR mass outflow rates in the range 0.005-3 Mequation/yr, showing a correlation with the bolometric luminosity consistent with that observed for ionized winds in the NLR and X-ray winds detected in local AGN, and kinetic power equation10equation Lequation. Finally, we found an anti-correlation between the equivalent width of the [OIII] line with respect to the CIV shift, and a positive correlation with [OIII] outflow velocity. These findings, for the first time in an unbiased sample of AGN at zequation2, support a scenario where BLR winds are connected to galaxy scale detected outflows, and are capable of affecting the gas in the NLR located at kpc scale.",20,[],1
2007.13009,astro-ph,"Asteroid material is detected in white dwarfs (WDs) as atmospheric pollution by metals, in the form of gas/dust discs, or in photometric transits. Within the current paradigm, minor bodies need to be scattered, most likely by planets, into highly eccentric orbits where the material gets disrupted by tidal forces and then accreted onto the star. This can occur through a planet-planet scattering process triggered by the stellar mass loss during the post main-sequence evolution of planetary systems. So far, studies of the equation-body dynamics of this process have used artificial planetary system architectures built ad hoc. In this work, we attempt to go a step further and study the dynamical instability provided by more restrictive systems, that, at the same time allow us an exploration of a wider parameter space: the hundreds of multiple planetary systems found around main-sequence (MS) stars. We find that most of our simulated systems remain stable during the MS, Red and Asymptotic Giant Branch and for several Gyr into the WD phases of the host star. Overall, only equation 2.3equation of the simulated systems lose a planet on the WD as a result of dynamical instability. If the instabilities take place during the WD phase most of them result in planet ejections with just 5 planetary configurations ending as a collision of a planet with the WD.

However, interpreting the observations is challenging without models that consistently account for both the complexity of the protostellar birth environment and polarization mechanisms. We aim to provide a better understanding with a focus on bridge-like structures such as that observed towards the protostellar multiple IRAS 16293--2422 by comparing synthetic polarization maps of thermal reemission with observations. We analyze the magnetic field properties associated with the formation of a protostellar multiple based on ideal MHD 3D zoom-in simulations carried out with the RAMSES code. To compare with observations, we post-process a snapshot of a bridge-like structure that is associated with a forming triple star system with the radiative transfer code POLARIS and produce multi-wavelength dust polarization maps. In the most prominent bridge of our sample, the typical density is about 10(-16) g cm(-3), and the magnetic field strength is about 1 to 2 mG. The magnetic field structure has an elongated toroidal morphology and the dust polarization maps trace the complex morphology. In contrast, the magnetic field strength associated with the launching of asymmetric bipolar outflows is significantly more magnetized (~100 mG). At letter=1.3 mm, the orientation of grains in the bridge is similar for the case accounting for radiative alignment torques (RATs) compared to perfect alignment with magnetic field lines. However, the polarization fraction in the bridge is three times smaller for the RAT scenario compared to assuming perfect alignment. At shorter wavelengths (letter < 200 letterm), dust polarization does not trace the magnetic field because other effects such as self-scattering and dichroic extinction dominate the orientation of the polarization.",20,[],1
2007.00260,astro-ph,"While observations of many high-precision radio pulsars of order equation 1 equations across the sky are needed for the detection and characterization of a stochastic background of low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), sensitivity to single sources of GWs requires even higher timing precision. The Argentine Institute of Radio Astronomy (IAR; Instituto Argentino de Radioastronom\'ia) has begun observations of the brightest-known millisecond pulsar, J0437-4715. Even though the two antennas are smaller than other single-dish telescopes previously used for pulsar timing array (PTA) science, the IAR's capability to monitor this pulsar daily coupled with the pulsar's brightness allows for high-precision pulse arrival-time measurements. While upgrades of the facility are currently underway, we show that modest improvements beyond current plans will provide IAR with unparalleled sensitivity to this pulsar. The most stringent upper limits on single GW sources come from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). Observations of PSR J0437-4715 will provide a significant sensitivity increase in NANOGrav's ""blind spot"" in the sky where fewer pulsars are currently being observed. With state-of-the-art instrumentation installed, we estimate the array's sensitivity will improve by a factor of equation2-7 over 10 years for 20% of the sky with the inclusion of this pulsar as compared to a static version of the PTA used in NANOGrav's most recent limits. More modest instrumentation result in factors of equation1.4-4. We identify four other candidate pulsars as suitable for inclusion in PTA efforts.

2002.11774,astro-ph,"Numerous attempts to estimate the rate at which low-mass stars lose angular momentum over their lifetimes exist in the literature. One approach is to use magnetic maps derived from Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) in conjunction with so-called ""braking laws"". The use of ZDI maps has advantages over other methods because it allows information about the magnetic field geometry to be incorporated into the estimate. However, ZDI is known to underestimate photospheric field strengths due to flux cancellation effects. Recently, Lehmann et al. (2018) conducted synthetic ZDI reconstructions on a set of flux transport simulations to help quantify the amount by which ZDI underestimates the field strengths of relatively slowly rotating and weak activity solar-like stars. In this paper, we evaluate how underestimated angular momentum-loss rate estimates based on ZDI maps may be. We find that they are relatively accurate for stars with strong magnetic fields but may be underestimated by a factor of up to equation10 for stars with weak magnetic fields. Additionally, we re-evaluate our previous work that used ZDI maps to study the relative contributions of different magnetic field modes to angular momentum-loss. We previously found that the dipole component dominates spin-down for most low-mass stars. This conclusion still holds true even in light of the work of Lehmann et al. (2018).",20,[],1
2005.05223,astro-ph,"One of the most enigmatic phenomena related to solar activity is the so-called Maunder minimum phase. It consists of the lowest sunspot's counting ever registered for the Sun, and never so far confirmed for other stars. Since the spectroscopic observations of stellar activity at the Mount Wilson Observatory, the solar analog HD43587 has shown a very low and apparently invariant activity level, which makes it a Maunder minimum candidate. We analyze the chromospheric activity evolution of HD43587 and its evolutive status, intending to unravel the reasons for this low and flat activity. We use an activity measurements dataset available in the literature, and compute the activity S-index from HARPS and NARVAL spectra, to infer a cycle period. Besides, we analyze the CoRoT light-curve of HD43587, and apply gyrochronology and activity calibrations, to determine its rotation period. Finally, based on an evolutionary model and the inferred rotation period, we use the EULAG-MHD code to perform global MHD simulations of HD43587 with the aim of getting some insights about its dynamo process. We confirm the almost flat activity profile, with a cycle period equation yrs deduced from the S-index time series, and a long-term trend that might be a period larger than 50 yrs. It was impossible to define a rotation period from the light-curve, however gyrochronology and activity calibrations allow to infer an indirect estimate of equation d. Furthermore, the MHD simulations confirm an oscillatory dynamo with a cycle period in good agreement with the observations and a low level of surface magnetic activity. We conclude that this object might be experiencing a ""natural"" decrease in magnetic activity as a consequence of its age. Nevertheless, the possibility that HD43587 is in a Maunder minimum phase cannot be ruled out.",20,[],1
2001.07123,astro-ph,"The early thermal evolution of Moon has been numerically simulated to understand the magnitude of the impact induced heating and the initially stored thermal energy of the accreting Moonlets. The main objective of the present study is to understand the nature of processes leading to core-mantle differentiation and the production and cooling of the initial convective magma ocean. The accretion of Moon was commenced over a timescale of 100 years after the giant impact event around 30-100 million years in the early solar system. We studied the dependence of the planetary processes on the impact scenarios, the initial average temperature of the accreting moonlets and the size of the protoMoon that accreted rapidly beyond the Roche limit within the initial one year after the giant impact. The simulations indicate that the accreting Moonlets should have a minimum initial averaged temperature around 1600 K. The impacts would provide additional thermal energy. The initial thermal state of the moonlets depends upon the environment prevailing within the Roche limit that experienced episodes of extensive vaporization and re-condensation of silicates. The initial convective magma ocean of depth more than 1000 km is produced in the majority of simulations along with the global core-mantle differentiation in case the melt percolation of the molten metal through porous flow from bulk silicates was not the major mode of core-mantle differentiation. The possibility of shallow magma oceans cannot be ruled out in the presence of the porous flow.

2003.04348,astro-ph,"The Kepler mission observed thousands of transiting exoplanet candidates around hundreds of thousands of FGK dwarf stars. He, Ford, & Ragozzine (2019) (arXiv:1907.07773) applied forward modelling to infer the distribution of intrinsic architectures of planetary systems, developed a clustered Poisson point process model for exoplanetary systems (SysSim) to reproduce the marginal distributions of the observed Kepler population, and showed that orbital periods and planet radii are clustered within a given planetary system. Here, we extend the clustered model to explore correlations between planetary systems and their host star properties. We split the sample of Kepler FGK dwarfs into two halves and model the fraction of stars with planets (between 0.5-10 equation and 3--300 d), equation, as a linear function of the Gaia DR2 equation colour, where equation is a reddening correction. We find that the occurrence of these planetary systems rises significantly towards later type (redder or higher equation) stars, with a slope of equation. The fraction of stars with planets increases from equation for F2V dwarfs to equation for mid K-dwarfs. About half (equation) of all solar-type (G2V) dwarfs harbour a planetary system between 3 and 300 d. We considered three related models and find that the rise in equation with equation is robust. While this linear equation model is simple, it can closely match the observed multiplicity distributions of both bluer and redder halves in our sample, suggesting that the architectures of planetary systems around stars of different spectral types may be similar aside from a shift in the overall fraction of planet hosting stars.",20,[],1

The intermetallics crystallize in the C15 cubic structure , whereas corresponding hydrides and deuterides crystallize in a monoclinic structure. All compounds display a linear decrease of the unit cell volume versus Er concentration; the hydrides have a 0.8% larger cell volume compared to the deuterides with same Er content. They are ferrimagnetic at low field and temperature with a compensation point at x = 0.33 for the intermetallics and x = 0.57 for the hydrides and deuterides. A sharp first order ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic (FM-AFM) transition is observed upon heating at TFM-AFM for both hydrides and deuterides. These compounds show two different types of field induced transitions, which have different physical origin. At low temperature (T < 50 K), a forced ferri-ferromagnetic metamagnetic transition with Btrans1 = 8 T, related to the change of the Er moments orientation from antiparallel to parallel Fe moment, is observed. Btrans1 is not sensitive to Er concentration, temperature and isotope effect. A second metamagnetic transition resulting from antiferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic state is also observed. The transition field Btrans2 increases linearly versus temperature and relates to the itinerant electron metamagnetic behavior of the Fe sublattice. An onset temperature TM0 is obtained by extrapolating TFM-AFM (B) at zero field. TM0 decreases linearly versus the Er content and is 45(5) K higher for the hydrides compared to the corresponding deuteride. The evolution of TM0 versus cell volume shows that it cannot be attributed exclusively to a pure volume effect and that electronic effects should also be considered.",20,[],8

By changing the twisting angle equation, we show a significant oscillation of the thermal conductance equation, due to the size effect for gratings of both square and circular shapes. The distance- and twisting-dependent coupling between the gratings accounts for a strong and characteristic modulation of radiative thermal conductance with implications for the energy management, sensing, and NEMS/MEMS devices.",20,[],8
2003.04357,cond-mat,"Superconductivity and magnetism are antagonistic states of matter. The presence of spontaneous magnetic fields inside the superconducting state is, therefore, an intriguing phenomenon prompting extensive experimental and theoretical research. In this review, we discuss recent experimental discoveries of unconventional superconductors which spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry and theoretical efforts in understanding their properties. We discuss the main experimental probes and give an extensive account of theoretical approaches to understand the order parameter symmetries and the corresponding pairing mechanisms including the importance of multiple bands.",20,[],8
2003.07081,cond-mat,"High-resolution thermal expansion and magnetostriction measurements were performed on single crystals of equation-RuClequation in magnetic fields applied parallel to the Ru-Ru bonds. The length changes were measured in the direction perpendicular to the honeycomb planes. Our data show clear thermodynamic characteristics for the field-induced phase transition at the critical field equation T where the antiferromagnetic zigzag order is suppressed. At higher fields, a kink in the magnetostriction coefficient signals an additional phase transition around equation T. The extracted Gruneisen parameter shows typical hallmarks for quantum criticality near equation, but also displays anomalous behavior above equation. We compare our experimental data with linear spin-wave calculations employing a minimal Kitaev-Heisenberg model in the semiclassical limit. Most of the salient features are in agreement with each other, however, the peculiar features in the high-field region above equation cannot be accounted for in our modelling and hence suggest a genuine quantum nature. We construct a phase diagram for equation-RuClequation showing two low-temperature transitions induced by an in-plane field along the Ru-Ru bonds.",20,[],8
2010.08289,cond-mat,"Statically indeterminate systems are experimentally demonstrated to be in fact dynamical at the microscopic scale. Take the classic ladder-wall problem, for instance. Depending on the Young's modulus of the wall, it may take up to twenty minutes before its weight saturates. This finding is shown to be shared by other statically indeterminate systems, such as a granule silo and a beam with three support points. We believe that the aging effect is responsible for this surprising phenomenon because it can be correlated with the evolution of microscopic contact area with the wall and floor. Finally, a heuristic and simple method is introduced that can uniquely determine and analytically solve the saturated weight without invoking detailed material properties.",20,[],8
2003.11162,cond-mat,"To estimate the Curie temperature of metallic magnets from first principles, we develop a local force method for the tight-binding model having spin-dependent hopping derived from spin density functional theory. While spin-dependent hopping is crucial for the self-consistent mapping to the effective spin model, the numerical cost to treat such non-local terms in the conventional Green's function scheme is formidably expensive. Here, we propose a formalism based on the kernel polynomial method (KPM), which makes the calculation dramatically efficient. We perform a benchmark calculation for bcc-Fe, fcc-Co, and fcc-Ni and find that the effect of the magnetic non-local terms is particularly prominent for bcc-Fe. We also present several local approximations to the magnetic non-local terms for which we can apply the Green's function method and reduce the numerical cost further by exploiting the intermediate representation of the Green's function. By comparing the results of the KPM and local methods, we discuss which local method works most successfully. Our approach provides an efficient way to estimate the Curie temperature of metallic magnets with a complex spin configuration.",20,[],8
2003.02166,cond-mat,"Organosulfur compounds at the interface to noble metals have proved over the last decades to be extremely versatile systems for both fundamental and applied research. However, the anchoring of thiols to gold remained an object of controversy for long times. The RS-Au-SR linkage, in particular, is a robust bonding configuration that displays interesting properties. It is generated spontaneously at room temperature and can be used for the production of extended molecular nanostructures. In this work we explore the behavior of 1,4-Bis(4-mercaptophenyl)benzene (BMB) on the Au(111) surface, which results in the formation of 2D crystalline metal-organic assemblies stabilized by this type of Au-thiolate bonds. We show how to control the thiolates stereospecific bonding motif and thereby choose whether to form ordered arrays of Au3BMB3 units with embedded triangular nanopores, or linearly stacked metal-organic chains. The former turn out to be the thermodynamically favored structures and display confinement of the underneath Au(111) surface state. The electronic properties of single molecules as well as of the 2D crystalline self-assemblies have been characterized both on the metal-organic backbone and inside the associated pores.",20,[],8
2003.04637,cond-mat,Changes of the electron work-function of a superconductor proportional to the square of the current density equation are known as Bernoulli effect in superconductors or current induced Contact Potential Difference (CPD). The temperature dependent constant equation is parametrized by the effective mass of Cooper pairs equation. In such a way the study of the Bernoulli effect leads to creation of Cooper pair mass-spectroscopy. In this paper a short review on the Bernoulli effect in superconductors is given and a proposed experimental set-up for its measurement is described in detail. The experiment requires standard electronic equipment and can be implemented in every laboratory related to physics of superconductivity. This experimental set-up for observation of current induced CPD requires nano-technological hybrid superconductor structures with atomically clean interfaces and measurement of nano-volt signals with capacitive coupling to the sample.,20,[],8
2001.05143,cond-mat,"Cluster perturbation theory is applied to the two-dimensional Hubbard equation model to obtain doping and temperature dependent electronic spectral function with equation and 12-site clusters. It is shown that evolution of the pseudogap and electronic dispersion with doping and temperature is similar and in both cases it is significantly influenced by spin-spin short-range correlations. When short-range magnetic order is weakened by doping or temperature and Hubbard-I like electronic dispersion becomes more pronounced, the Fermi arc turns into large Fermi surface and the pseudogap closes. It is demonstrated how static spin correlations impact the overall dispersion's shape and how accounting for dynamic contributions leads to momentum-dependent spectral weight at the Fermi surface and broadening effects.",20,[],8

2005.09701,cond-mat,"The creation of disordered hyperuniform materials with potentially extraordinary optical properties requires a capacity to synthesize large samples that are effectively hyperuniform down to the nanoscale. Motivated by this challenge, we propose a fabrication protocol using binary superparamagnetic colloidal particles confined in a 2D plane. The strong and long-ranged dipolar interaction induced by a tunable magnetic field is free from screening effects that attenuates long-ranged electrostatic interactions in charged colloidal systems. Specifically, we find a family of optimal size ratios that makes the two-phase system effectively hyperuniform. We show that hyperuniformity is a general consequence of low isothermal compressibilities, which makes our protocol suitable to systems with other long-ranged soft interactions, dimensionalities and/or polydispersity. Our methodology paves the way to synthesize large photonic hyperuniform materials that function in the visible to infrared range and hence may accelerate the discovery of novel photonic materials.",20,[],8
2008.02446,cond-mat,"Spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) refers to a resistance change in a metallic film reflecting the magnetization direction of a magnet attached to the film. The mechanism of this phenomenon is spin exchange between conduction-electron spins and magnetization at the interface. SMR has been used to read out information written in a small magnet and to detect magnetization dynamics, but it has been limited to magnets; magnetic ordered phases or instability of magnetic phase transition has been believed to be indispensable. Here, we report the observation of SMR in a paramagnetic insulator GdequationGaequationOequation (GGG) without spontaneous magnetization combined with a Pt film. The paramagnetic SMR can be attributed to spin-transfer torque acting on localized spins in GGG. We determine the efficiencies of spin torque and spin-flip scattering at the Pt/GGG interface, and demonstrate these quantities can be tuned with external magnetic fields. The results clarify the mechanism of spin-transport at a metal/paramagnetic insulator interface, which gives new insight into the spintronic manipulation of spin states in paramagnetic systems.",20,[],8

Topological quantum chemistry has enabled the understanding of and the search for paramagnetic topological materials. Using magnetic topological indices obtained from magnetic topological quantum chemistry (MTQC), here we perform a high-throughput search for magnetic topological materials based on first-principles calculations. We use as our starting point the Magnetic Materials Database on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server, which contains more than 549 magnetic compounds with magnetic structures deduced from neutron-scattering experiments, and identify 130 enforced semimetals (for which the band crossings are implied by symmetry eigenvalues), and topological insulators. For each compound, we perform complete electronic structure calculations, which include complete topological phase diagrams using different values of the Hubbard potential. Using a custom code to find the magnetic co-representations of all bands in all magnetic space groups, we generate data to be fed into the algorithm of MTQC to determine the topology of each magnetic material. Several of these materials display previously unknown topological phases, including symmetry-indicated magnetic semimetals, three-dimensional anomalous Hall insulators and higher-order magnetic semimetals. We analyse topological trends in the materials under varying interactions: 60 per cent of the 130 topological materials have topologies sensitive to interactions, and the others have stable topologies under varying interactions. We provide a materials database for future experimental studies and open-source code for diagnosing topologies of magnetic materials.",20,[],8

By using a solid state reaction method, the samarium doped 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene samples are successfully synthesized. These samples are characterized by magnetization, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope(SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurements. The X-ray diffractions reveal that the sample crystallizes in a space group of equation. The magnetization measurements reveal a superconducting transition at about 4.3 K. However, the superconducting shielding fraction is only about 1%, which is similar to the previous reports of the superconductivity in other aromatic hydrocarbons.

2011.09198,cond-mat,"We present a detailed experimental optical study supported by theoretical modeling of InAs quantum dots (QDs) embedded in an InAlGaAs barrier lattice-matched to InP(001) grown with the use of a ripening step in molecular beam epitaxy. The method leads to the growth of in-plane symmetric QDs of low surface density, characterized by a multimodal size distribution resulting in a spectrally broad emission in the range of equation equationm, essential for many near-infrared photonic applications. We find that, in contrast to the InAs/InP system, the multimodal distribution results here from a two-monolayer difference in QD height between consecutive families of dots. This may stem from the long-range ordering in the quaternary barrier alloy that stabilizes QD nucleation. Measuring the photoluminescence (PL) lifetime of the spectrally broad emission, we find a nearly dispersionless value of equation ns. Finally, we examine the temperature dependence of emission characteristics. We underline the impact of localized states in the wetting layer playing the role of carrier reservoir during thermal carrier redistribution.

2002.11354,cond-mat,"The fission of singlet excitons into triplet pairs in organic materials holds great technological promise, but the rational application of this phenomenon is hampered by a lack of understanding of its complex photophysics. Here, we use the controlled introduction of vacancies by means of spacer molecules in tetracene and pentacene thin films as a tuning parameter complementing experimental observables to identify the operating principles of different singlet fission pathways. Time-resolved spectroscopic measurements in combination with microscopic modelling enables us to demonstrate distinct scenarios, resulting from different singlet-to-triplet energy alignments. For exothermic fission, as found for pentacene, coherent mixing between the photoexcited singlet and triplet pair states is promoted by vibronic resonances, which drives the fission process with little sensitivity to the vacancy concentration. For endothermic materials, such as tetracene, the impossibility of such vibronic resonances renders fission fully incoherent; a process that is shown to slow down with vacancy concentration.",20,[],8

Two major classes of cities were identified based on the recovered value of equation and equation, which correspond respectively to the KPZ and the EW universality classes. Picking a discrete model from each of these classes and mapping it to physical rules for constructions in cities we conclude that imposed restrictions on buildings' heights are reflected in the exponent equation and thus have implications on how the skyline evolves.",20,[],8

Current chemical treatments do not passivate these sites, leading to decreased mobility and trap-limited photoluminescence. We present a generalizable treatment protocol based on the use of passivating agents such as thiols or sulfides in combination with a Lewis acid to passivate sulfur vacancies in monolayer MoSequation and WSequation, increasing photoluminescence up to 275 fold, while maintaining mobilities.

It is found to be a Type I antiferromagnet with a dominant nearest-neighbor equation interaction. In contrast, the equation Wequation analogue BaequationMnWOequation is a Type II antiferromagnet with a significant next-nearest-neighbor equation interaction.

As a preliminary survey, for an intermediate value of equation, we examined the finite-size-scaling behavior of equation, and found a pronounced signature for the criticality; note that the magnetic susceptibility exhibits a weak (logarithmic) singularity at the N\'eel temperature. Thereby, we turn to the analysis of the power-law singularity of the phase boundary at equation.

Providing a clear understanding of why the (NC)GGE well describes the long-time behaviors, we construct, for noninteracting models, the exact NCGGE that describes the long-time behaviors without an error even at finite system size. It is noteworthy that the NCGGE involves nonlocal conserved quantities, which can be necessary for describing long-time behaviors of local observables.

2008.01052,cond-mat,"We used a combination of polarized Raman spectroscopy and spin wave calculations to study magnetic excitations in the strong spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) bilayer perovskite antiferromagnet equation. We observed two broad Raman features at ~ 800 equation and ~ 1400 equation arising from magnetic excitations. Unconventionally, the ~ 800 equation feature is fully symmetric (equation) with respect to the underlying tetragonal (equation) crystal lattice which, together with its broad line shape, definitively rules out the possibility of a single magnon excitation as its origin. In contrast, the ~ 1400 equation feature shows up in both the equation and equation channels. From spin wave and two-magnon scattering cross-section calculations of a tetragonal bilayer antiferromagnet, we identified the ~ 800 equation (~ 1400 equation) feature as two-magnon excitations with pairs of magnons from the zone-center equation point (zone-boundary van Hove singularity X point). We further found that this zone-center two-magnon scattering is unique to bilayer perovskite magnets which host an optical branch in addition to the acoustic branch, as compared to their single layer counterparts. This zone-center two-magnon mode is distinct in symmetry from the time-reversal symmetry broken spin wave gap and phase mode proposed to explain the ~ 92 meV (742 equation) gap in RIXS magnetic excitation spectra of equation.",20,[],8
2004.10425,cond-mat,"By employing a series of experimental techniques, we provide clear evidence that CaPtAs represents a rare example of a noncentrosymmetric superconductor which simultaneously exhibits nodes in the superconducting gap and broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) in its superconducting state (below equation equation 1.5 K). Unlike in fully-gapped superconductors, the magnetic penetration depth equation does not saturate at low temperatures, but instead it shows a equation-dependence, characteristic of gap nodes. Both the superfluid density and the electronic specific heat are best described by a two-gap model comprising of a nodeless gap and a gap with nodes, rather than by single-band models. At the same time, zero-field muon-spin spectra exhibit increased relaxation rates below the onset of superconductivity, implying that TRS is broken in the superconducting state of CaPtAs, hence indicating its unconventional nature.

We consider a two-dimensional photonic crystal comprised of a self-assembled array of parallel dielectric hard rods of infinite length with circular or square cross section. We find the PBGs can exist over a large range of intermediate packing densities. Counterintuitively, the largest band gap does not always appear at the packing density where the crystal is most ordered, despite the randomness inherent in any self-assembled structure. For rods with square cross section at intermediate packing densities, we find that the transverse magnetic (TM) band gap of the self-assembled (i.e. thermal) system can be larger than that of identical rods arranged in a perfect square lattice. By considering hollow rods, we find the band gap of transverse electric (TE) modes can be substantially increased while that of TM modes show no obvious improvement over solid rods.

Additionally, both SSE signals show a tendency to saturate at low temperatures. The nonlocal SSE signal decays exponentially for intermediate injector-detector separation, consistent with magnon spin current transport in the relaxation regime. We estimate the magnon relaxation length of our equation-equation films to be around 500 nm at 3 K. This short magnon relaxation length along with the strong temperature dependence of the SSE signal indicates that temperature-dependent inelastic magnon scattering processes play an important role in the intermediate range magnon transport.

Here we use non-destructive Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging to study the in situ annealing of FIB-milled gold microcrystals. We simultaneously measure two non-collinear reflections for two different crystals during a single annealing cycle, demonstrating the ability to reliably track the location of multiple Bragg peaks during thermal annealing. The thermal lattice expansion of each crystal is used to calculate the local temperature. This is compared to thermocouple readings, which are shown to be substantially affected by thermal resistance. To evaluate the annealing process, we analyse each reflection by considering facet area evolution, cross-correlation maps of displacement field and binarised morphology, and average strain plots. The crystal's strain and morphology evolve with increasing temperature, which is likely to be caused by the diffusion of gallium in gold below ~280\degC and the self-diffusion of gold above ~280\degC.

2011.05967,cond-mat,"The impact of magnetic anisotropy on the skyrmion lattice (SkL) state in cubic chiral magnets has been overlooked for long, partly because a semi-quantitative description of the thermodynamically stable SkL phase pocket forming near the Curie temperature could be achieved without invoking anisotropy effects. However, there has been a range of phenomena reported recently in these materials, such as the formation of low-temperature tilted conical and SkL states as well as temperature-induced transformations of lattice geometry in metastable SkL states, where anisotropy was suspected to play a key role. To settle this issue on experimental basis, we quantified the cubic anisotropy in a series of CoZnMn-type cubic chiral magnets. We found that the strength of anisotropy is highly enhanced towards low temperatures in all the compounds, moreover, not only the magnitude but also the character of cubic anisotropy drastically varies upon changing the Co/Mn ratio. We correlate these changes with temperature- and composition-induced variations of the helical modulation vectors, the anharmonicity and structural rearrangements of the metastable SkLs and the spin relaxation rates. Similar systematic studies on magnetic anisotropy may not only pave the way for a quantitative and unified description of the stable and metastable modulated spin textures in cubic chiral magnets but would also help exploring further topological spin textures in this large class of skyrmion hosts.",20,[],8
2007.03382,cond-mat,"We show that the density of indium islands on GaAs(111)A substrates have a non-monotonic, reentrant behavior as a function of the indium deposition temperature. The expected increase in the density with decreasing temperature, indeed, is observed only down to 160 \degC, where the indium islands undertake the expected liquid-to-solid phase transition. Further decreasing the temperature causes a sizeable reduction of the island density. An additional, reentrant increasing behavior is observed below 80 \degC. We attribute the above complex behavior to the liquid-solid phase transition and to the complex island-island interaction which takes place between crystalline islands in the presence of strain. Indium solid islands grown at temperatures below 160 \degC have a face-centered cubic crystal structure.",20,[],8
2008.13565,cond-mat,"Iron is a candidate to replace cobalt in WC hardmetals, due to its lower cost and toxicity. A WC-FeCr hardmetal was compression tested at 900-1200 \degC. Particular attention is paid to the steady-state creep rates and stress-exponents (n) during isostress treatments. Three regimes of stress dependence are observed. Two of these were previously reported for WC-Co: power law creep (n~3) at medium stresses; and grain boundary sliding (n~1) at higher stresses, generally >100MPa. A previously unreported low stress (<10MPa) regime with an exponent of n~2 is also observed. By combining electron microscopy with X-ray diffraction texture measurements, the low stress regime is attributed to viscous flow of the binder, which is accommodated by diffusional creep in the WC skeleton. The mechanism may be applicable to other hardmetals. Compared to analogous WC-Co materials, WC-FeCr shows improved creep resistance below 1000 \degC, which can be explained by its lower self-diffusivity, and a lower solubility for WC than Co. However, at temperatures corresponding to liquid eutectic formation (~1140 \degC), its creep resistance becomes inferior. These results indicate FeCr may be a suitable replacement for Co provided the eutectic temperature is not exceeded.",20,[],8
2002.12294,cond-mat,"Chains of magnetic atoms with either strong spin-orbit coupling or spiral magnetic order which are proximity-coupled to superconducting substrates can host topologically non-trivial Majorana bound states. The experimental signature of these states consists of spectral weight at the Fermi energy and spatially localized near the ends of the chain. However, topologically trivial Yu-Shiba-Rusinov in-gap states localized near the ends of the chain can lead to similar spectra. Here, we explore a protocol to disentangle these contributions by artificially augmenting a candidate Majorana spin chain with orbitally-compatible nonmagnetic atoms. Combining scanning tunneling spectroscopy with ab-initio and tight-binding calculations, we realize a sharp spatial transition between the proximity-coupled spiral magnetic order and the non-magnetic superconducting wire termination, with persistent zero-energy spectral weight localized at either end of the magnetic spiral. Our findings open a new path towards the control of the spatial position of in-gap end states, trivial or Majorana, via different chain terminations, and the realization of designer Majorana chain networks for demonstrating topological quantum computation.",20,[],8
2002.03333,cond-mat,We investigate the persistence probability equation of the position of a Brownian particle with shape asymmetry in two dimensions. The persistence probability is defined as the probability that a stochastic variable has not changed it's sign in the given time interval. We explicitly consider two cases -- diffusion of a free particle and that of harmonically trapped particle. The later is particularly relevant in experiments which uses trapping and tracking techniques to measure the displacements. We provide analytical expressions of equation for both the scenarios and show that in the absence of the shape asymmetry the results reduce to the case of an isotropic particle. The analytical expressions of equation are further validated against numerical simulation of the underlying overdamped dynamics. We also illustrate that equation can be a measure to determine the shape asymmetry of a colloid and the translational and rotational diffusivities can be estimated from the measured persistence probability. The advantage of this method is that it does not require the tracking of the orientation of the particle.,20,[],8

We find that the samples, labelled S1 and S2, have the composition LiequationNiequationMnequationCoequationOequation, with equation, equation for S1 and equation, equation for S2, corresponding to different concentrations of magnetic ions and excess Niequation in the Liequationlayers. Both samples show a peak in the zero-field cooled (ZFC) dc susceptibility at 8 K but the temperature at which the ZFC and FC (field-cooled) curves deviate is substantially different. Ac susceptibility measurements indicate a frequency-dependent transition in S1 and a frequency-independent transition in S2. Our results demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of bulk magnetic measurements to off-stoichiometry of the magnetic transition metal ions in Li NMC 811 and indicate that such measurements can be used to benchmark sample quality for Ni-rich Li ion battery cathode materials.",20,[],8
2003.08439,cond-mat,"Even though no local order parameter in the sense of the Landau theory exists for topological quantum phase transitions in Chern insulators, the highly non-local Berry curvature exhibits critical behavior near a quantum critical point. We investigate the critical properties of its real space analog, the local Chern marker, in weakly disordered Chern insulators. Due to disorder, inhomogeneities appear in the spatial distribution of the local Chern marker. Their size exhibits power-law scaling with the critical exponent matching the one extracted from the Berry curvature of a clean system. We drive the system slowly through such a quantum phase transition. The characteristic size of inhomogeneities in the non-equilibrium post-quench state obeys the Kibble-Zurek scaling. In this setting, the local Chern marker thus does behave in a similar way as a local order parameter for a symmetry breaking second order phase transition. The Kibble-Zurek scaling also holds for the inhomogeneities in the spatial distribution of excitations and of the orbital polarization.",20,[],8
2006.14462,cond-mat,"Robustness against small perturbations is a crucial feature of topological properties. This robustness is both a source of theoretical interest and a drive for technological applications, but presents a challenge when looking for new topological systems: Small perturbations cannot be used to identify the global direction of change in the topological indices. Here, we overcome this limitation by breaking the symmetries protecting the topology. The introduction of symmetry-breaking terms causes the topological indices to become non-quantized variables, which are amenable to efficient design algorithms based on gradient methods. We demonstrate this capability by designing discrete and continuous phononic systems realizing conventional and higher-order topological insulators.",20,[],8

Although there are a number of generally accepted approaches to solve this problem, which are widely used in the EXAFS data analysis, they often provide less accurate results when applied to outer coordination shells around the absorbing atom. In this case, the advanced techniques based on the molecular dynamics and reverse Monte Carlo simulations are known to be more appropriate: their strengths and weaknesses are reviewed here.",20,[],8
2003.10124,cond-mat,"We have discovered the existence of extremely polydisperse High Internal-Phase-Ratio Emulsions (HIPE) in which the internal-phase droplets, present at 95% volume fraction, remain spherical and organize themselves in the available space according to Apollonian packing rules. Such Apollonian emulsions are obtained from dispersing oil dropwise in water in the presence of very little surfactant, and allowing them to evolve at rest for a week. The packing structure of the droplets was confirmed through size distribution measurements that evolved spontaneously towards power laws with the known Apollonian exponents, as well as comparison of the structure factors of aged HIPEs measured by Small-Angle X-ray Scattering with that of a numerically simulated Random Apollonian Packing. Thanks to the perfect sphericity of the droplets, Apollonian emulsions were found to display Newtonian ow even at such extremely high volume fraction. We argue that these fascinating space-filling assemblies of spherical droplets are a result of coalescence and fragmentation processes obeying simple geometrical rules of conserving total volume and sphericity, minimizing the elastic energy associated with interactions of neighbouring droplets.",20,[],8
2009.03982,cond-mat,"Imaging the magnetic configuration of thin-films has been a long-standing area of research. Since a few years, the emergence of two-dimensional ferromagnetic materials calls for innovation in the field of magnetic imaging. As the magnetic moments are extremely small, standard techniques like SQUID, torque magnetometry, magnetic force microscopy and Kerr effect microscopy are challenging and often lead to the detection of parasitic magnetic contributions or spurious effects. In this work, we report a new magnetic microscopy technique based on the combination of magnetic circular dichroism and Seebeck effect in semiconductor/ferromagnet bilayers. We implement this method with perpendicularly magnetized (Co/Pt) multilayers sputtered on Ge (111). We further show that the electrical detection of MCD is more sensitive than the Kerr magnetometry, especially in the ultra-thin film regime, which makes it particularly promising for the study of emergent two-dimensional ferromagnetic materials.",20,[],8
2011.04648,cond-mat,"Dihedral liquid crystals (DLCs) are assemblies of microscopic constituent particles that exhibit equation-fold discrete rotational and reflection symmetries. Generalizing the half-integer defects in nematic liquid crystals, two-dimensional DLCs can host point defects of fractional topological charge equation. Starting from a generic microscopic model, we derive a unified hydrodynamic description of DLCs with aligning and anti-aligning short-range interactions in terms of Ginzburg-Landau and Swift-Hohenberg theories for a universal complex order-parameter field. Building on this framework, we demonstrate in both continuum and particle simulations how adiabatic braiding protocols, implemented through suitable boundary conditions, can realize classical counterparts of anyonic exchange symmetries. The theory further predicts a novel spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking transition in anti-aligning DLCs, in quantitative agreement with particle simulations. In view of recent advances in the design and controlled assembly of dihedral colloids, we expect that these theoretical predictions can be realized with currently available experimental technology, thereby promising a path to fractional topological information storage and processing in soft matter systems.",20,[],8

This method provides a physical-based understanding of the breakage effect in granular material.,20,[],8
2010.04986,cond-mat,"Multiferroics with intrinsic ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity are highly desired but rather rare, while most ferroelectric magnets are antiferromagnetic. A recent theoretical work [Phys. Rev. B \bf 99, 195434 (2019)] predicted that oxyhalides VOequation (equation: halogen) monolayers are two-dimensional multiferroics by violating the empirical equation rule. Most interestingly, the member VOIequation are predicted to exhibit spontaneous ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity. In this work, we extend the previous study on the structure and magnetism of VOIequation monolayer by using density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulation. The presence of the heavy element iodine with a strong spin-orbit coupling leads an effective Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in the polar structure, which favors a short-period spiral a magnetic structure.. Another interesting result is that the on-site Coulomb interaction can strongly suppress the polar distortion thus leading to a ferromagnetic metallic state. Therefore, the VOI2 monolayer is either a ferroelectric insulator with spiral magnetism or a ferromagnetic metal, instead of a ferromagnetic ferroelectric system. Our study highlights the key physical role of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.",20,[],8

The details of the effects crucially depend on the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter, whether it is nematic or chiral. The transition from the nematic state to the chiral one can be performed by application of a magnetic field while the transition from the chiral state to the nematic one is tuned by the external strain. These transitions associated with a jump of the magnetic susceptibility and mechanical stiffness. Possible experimental observations of the predicted effects are discussed.",20,[],8
2003.12842,cond-mat,"We present a model of contact process on Domany-Kinzel cellular automata with a geometrical disorder. In the 1-D model, each site is connected to two nearest neighbors which are either on the left or the right. The system is always attracted to an absorbing state with algebraic decay of average density with a continuously varying complex exponent. The log-periodic oscillations are imposed over and above the usual power law and are clearly evident as p to 1. This effect is purely due to an underlying topology because all sites have the same infection probability p and there is no disorder in the infection rate. An extension of this model to two and three dimensions leads to similar results. We also study a model with fixed immunization rate p0 in one and two dimensions. If p0 > ps, where ps is percolation threshold, the system always tends to an absorbing state. As infection rate p to 1, we observe a power law decay of order parameter with complex exponent. This may be a common feature in systems where quenched disorder leads to effective fragmentation of the lattice.",20,[],8

It is observed that the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is dominating in films which results in domain spin orientation preferably in out of plane direction. The Raman studies showed that the lattice is highly influenced by the magnetic order. The analysis of the phonon spectra around magnetic transition reveals the existence of strong spin-phonon coupling and the calculations resulted in spin-phonon coupling strength (letter) values of letter ~ 5 cm-1 and letter ~ 8.5 cm-1, for SrRuO3 films grown on LSAT and SrTiO3 single crystal substrates, respectively.",20,[],8

We show that some films show signatures of an unusual superconducting state, such as an in-plane critical field that is higher than both the paramagnetic and orbital pair breaking limits. Moreover, nonreciprocal transport, which reflects the ratio of odd versus even pairing interactions, is observed. Together, these characteristics indicate that these films provide a tunable platform for investigations of unconventional superconductivity.",20,[],8

2005.04059,cond-mat,"The second law of thermodynamics is a fundamental law of Nature. It is almost universally associated with the Clausius inequality that lower bounds a change in entropy by the ratio of supplied heat and temperature. However, this result presupposes that a system is in contact with a heat bath that drives it to a thermal state. For isolated systems that are moved from an initial equilibrium state by a dissipative heat exchange, the Clausius inequality has been predicted to be reversed. We here experimentally investigate the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of an isolated dilute gas of ultracold Cesium atoms that can be either thermalized or pushed out of equilibrium by means of laser cooling techniques. We determine in both cases the phase-space dynamics by tracing the evolution of the gas with position-resolved fluorescence imaging, from which we evaluate all relevant thermodynamic quantities.

2008.04184,cond-mat,"We present and implement a parquet approximation within the dual-fermion formalism based on a partial bosonization of the dual vertex function which substantially reduces the computational cost of the calculation.

After recasting the parquet equations in terms of the residual vertex, these are solved using the truncated unity method of Eckhardt et al. [Phys. Rev.

A low magnetic field of 1000 Oe applied on the spin-driven multiferroic hexaferrites BaSrCo2Fe11AlO22 and Ba0.9Sr1.1Co2Fe11AlO22 is able to cause a huge change in the linear magnetoelectric coefficient by several orders, leading to a giant magnetotranstance (GMT) effect at room temperature.

In particular, quantum confinement, and not electrostatics, is responsible for the logarithmic behavior of the effective potential for separations smaller than equation, instead of the one-over-distance bulk Coulomb interaction.

An experimental confirmation is given through the comparison of antiphase domain distributions in GaP and GaSb/AlSb samples grown on nominal and vicinal Si substrates. The antiphase domain burying step of GaP/Si samples is then observed at the atomic scale by scanning tunneling microscopy. The steps arising from the miscut allow growth rate imbalance between the two phases of the crystal and the growth conditions can deeply modify the imbalance coefficient, as illustrated with GaAs/Si.

2009.06296,cond-mat,"We discuss the emergence of an effective low-energy theory for the real-time dynamics of two classical impurity spins within the framework of a prototypical and purely classical model of indirect magnetic exchange: Two classical impurity spins are embedded in a host system which consists of a finite number of classical spins localized on the sites of a lattice and interacting via a nearest-neighbor Heisenberg exchange. An effective low-energy theory for the slow impurity-spin dynamics is derived for the regime, where the local exchange coupling between impurity and host spins is weak. To this end we apply the recently developed adiabatic spin dynamics (ASD) theory. Besides the Hamiltonian-like classical spin torques, the ASD additionally accounts for a novel topological spin torque that originates as a holonomy effect in the close-to-adiabatic-dynamics regime. It is shown that the effective low-energy precession dynamics cannot be derived from an effective Hamilton function and is characterized by a non-vanishing precession frequency even if the initial state deviates only slightly from a ground state. The effective theory is compared to the fully numerical solution of the equations of motion for the whole system of impurity and host spins to identify the parameter regime where the adiabatic effective theory applies. Effective theories beyond the adiabatic approximation must necessarily include dynamic host degrees of freedom and go beyond the idea of a simple indirect magnetic exchange.

2011.04578,cond-mat,"We report phenomenal yield strengths, up to one fourth of the theoretical strength of silver, recorded in microcompression testing of initially dislocation free silver micro and nanocubes synthesized from a multistep seed growth process. These high strengths and the massive strain bursts that occur upon yield are results of the initially dislocation free single crystal structure of the pristine samples that yield through spontaneous nucleation of dislocations. When the pristine samples are exposed to a focused ion beam to fabricate pillars and then compressed, the dramatic strain burst does not occur, and they yield at a quarter of the strength of their pristine counterparts. Regardless of the defect state of the samples prior to testing, a size effect is apparent, where the yield strength increases as the sample size decreases. Since dislocation starvation and the single arm source mechanisms cannot explain a size effect on yield strength in dislocation free samples, we investigate the dislocation nucleation mechanisms controlling the size effect through careful experimental observations and molecular statics simulations. We find that intrinsic or extrinsic symmetry breakers such as surface defects, edge roundness, external sample shape, or a high vacancy concentration can influence dislocation nucleation, and thus contribute to the size effect on yield strength in initially dislocation-free samples.",20,[],8

We demonstrate how hybridization of wavefunctions of Co layer and a monolayer of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)---such as semiconducting MoSeequation and WSeequation or metallic TaSeequation---can lead to dramatic transmutation of electronic and spin structure of Co within some distance away from its interface with TMD, when compared to the bulk of Co or its surface in contact with vacuum. This is due to proximity induced SO splitting of Co bands encoded in the spectral functions and spin textures on its monolayers, which we obtain using noncollinear density functional theory (ncDFT) combined with equilibrium Green function (GF) calculations. In fact, SO splitting is present due to structural inversion asymmetry of the bilayer even if SO coupling within TMD monolayer is artificially switched off in ncDFT calculations, but switching it on makes the effects associated with proximity SO coupling within Co layer about five times larger. Injecting spin-unpolarized charge current through SO-proximitized monolayers of Co generates nonequilibrium spin density over them, so that its cross product with the magnetization of Co determines SO torque. The SO torque computed via first-principles quantum transport methodology, which combines ncDFT with nonequilibrium GF calculations, can be used as the screening parameter to identify optimal combination of materials and their interfaces for applications in spintronics. In particular, we identify heterostructure two-monolayer-Co/monolayer-WSeequation as the most optimal.",20,[],8

Numerical simulations in the equation model, which is the equation Newman-Watts small-world model, and in the equation model lead us to conjecture that for equation the cumulative function of the DOS converges uniformly to that of the shifted Kesten-McKay DOS, in an interval equation, with equation.   For equation, we introduce a cutoff parameter equation modeling sphere repulsion. The case equation is the random elastic network case, with the DOS close to the Marchenko-Pastur DOS with parameter equation. For equation large the DOS is close for small equation to the shifted Kesten-McKay DOS with parameter equation; in the isostatic case the DOS has around equation the expected plateau. The boson peak frequency in equation with equation large is close to the one found in molecular dynamics simulations for equation and equation.",20,[],8

We found out that a Pt layer is more efficient than [Co/Pt]X, Cu or MgO layers in converting IR photon pulses into hot-electron pulses at a given laser power. We also found out that the maximum relative demagnetization amplitude is reached for M(x) = Pt (7 nm). Our experimental results show qualitative agreement with numerical simulations based on the superdiffusive spin transport model. We concluded that the maximum relative demagnetization amplitude, which corresponds to the highest photon conversion into hot-electrons, is an interplay between the IR penetration depth and the hot-electron inelastic mean free path within the capping layer.",20,[],8
2009.05931,cs,"Communicating effectively with customers is a challenge for many marketers, but especially in a context that is both pivotal to individual long-term financial well-being and difficult to understand: pensions. Around the world, participants are reluctant to consider their pension in advance, it leads to a lack of preparation of their pension retirement [1], [2]. In order to engage participants to obtain information on their expected pension benefits, personalizing the pension providers' email communication is a first and crucial step. We describe a machine learning approach to model email newsletters to fit participants' interests. The data for the modeling and analysis is collected from newsletters sent by a large Dutch pension provider of the Netherlands and is divided into two parts. The first part comprises 2,228,000 customers whereas the second part comprises the data of a pilot study, which took place in July 2018 with 465,711 participants. In both cases, our algorithm extracts features from continuous and categorical data using random forests, and then calculates node embeddings of the decision boundaries of the random forest. We illustrate the algorithm's effectiveness for the classification task, and how it can be used to perform data mining tasks. In order to confirm that the result is valid for more than one data set, we also illustrate the properties of our algorithm in benchmark data sets concerning churning. In the data sets considered, the proposed modeling demonstrates competitive performance with respect to other state of the art approaches based on random forests, achieving the best Area Under the Curve (AUC) in the pension data set (0.948). For the descriptive part, the algorithm can identify customer segmentations that can be used by marketing departments to better target their communication towards their customers.",20,[],7

It has exhibited promising outcomes and has shown incredible potential in solving challenging machine translation exercises. One such exercise is the best approach to furnish great MT to language sets with a little preparing information. In this work, Zero Shot Translation (ZST) is inspected for a low resource language pair. By working on high resource language pairs for which benchmarks are available, namely Spanish to Portuguese, and training on data sets (Spanish-English and English-Portuguese) we prepare a state of proof for ZST system that gives appropriate results on the available data. Subsequently the same architecture is tested for Sanskrit to Hindi translation for which data is sparse, by training the model on English-Hindi and Sanskrit-English language pairs. In order to prepare and decipher with ZST system, we broaden the preparation and interpretation pipelines of NMT seq2seq model in tensorflow, incorporating ZST features. Dimensionality reduction of word embedding is performed to reduce the memory usage for data storage and to achieve a faster training and translation cycles.

2010.10323,cs,"Automatic text summarization aims at condensing a document to a shorter version while preserving the key information. Different from extractive summarization which simply selects text fragments from the document, abstractive summarization generates the summary in a word-by-word manner. Most current state-of-the-art (SOTA) abstractive summarization methods are based on the Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture and focus on novel self-supervised objectives in pre-training. While these models well capture the contextual information among words in documents, little attention has been paid to incorporating global semantics to better fine-tune for the downstream abstractive summarization task.   In this study, we propose a topic-aware abstractive summarization (TAAS) framework by leveraging the underlying semantic structure of documents represented by their latent topics. Specifically, TAAS seamlessly incorporates a neural topic modeling into an encoder-decoder based sequence generation procedure via attention for summarization. This design is able to learn and preserve global semantics of documents and thus makes summarization effective, which has been proved by our experiments on real-world datasets. As compared to several cutting-edge baseline methods, we show that TAAS outperforms BART, a well-recognized SOTA model, by 2%, 8%, and 12% regarding the F measure of ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L, respectively. TAAS also achieves comparable performance to PEGASUS and ProphetNet, which is difficult to accomplish given that training PEGASUS and ProphetNet requires enormous computing capacity beyond what we used in this study.",20,[],7

It has the following advantages over a recently proposed algorithm: it does not rely on the linear programming machinery including separation oracles; it is SD-efficient (both ex-ante and ex-post); and the ex-ante outcome is equivalent to the outcome returned by the well-known probabilistic serial rule. As a result, we answer a question raised by Freeman, Shah, and Vaish (2020) whether the outcome of the probabilistic serial rule can be implemented by ex-post EF1 allocations. In the light of a couple of impossibility results that we prove, our algorithm can be viewed as satisfying a maximal set of properties. Under binary utilities, our algorithm is also ex-ante group-strategyproof and ex-ante Pareto optimal. Finally, we also show that checking whether a given random allocation can be implemented by a lottery over EF1 and Pareto optimal allocations is NP-hard.",20,[],7

This permits more sophisticated balance targets to be defined beyond a simple requirement of equal win chances.

2002.07464,cs,"Registration of multi-view point sets is a prerequisite for 3D model reconstruction. To solve this problem, most of previous approaches either partially explore available information or blindly utilize unnecessary information to align each point set, which may lead to the undesired results or introduce extra computation complexity. To this end, this paper consider the multi-view registration problem as a maximum likelihood estimation problem and proposes a novel multi-view registration approach under the perspective of Expectation-Maximization (EM). The basic idea of our approach is that different data points are generated by the same number of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). For each data point in one point set, its nearest neighbors can be searched from other well-aligned point sets. Then, we can suppose this data point is generated by the special GMM, which is composed of each nearest neighbor adhered with one Gaussian distribution. Based on this assumption, it is reasonable to define the likelihood function including all rigid transformations, which requires to be estimated for multi-view registration. Subsequently, the EM algorithm is utilized to maximize the likelihood function so as to estimate all rigid transformations. Finally, the proposed approach is tested on several bench mark data sets and compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results illustrate its super performance on accuracy, robustness and efficiency for the registration of multi-view point sets.",20,[],7

2007.05343,cs,"Capsule Networks (CapsNets) have demonstrated to be a promising alternative to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, they often fall short of state-of-the-art accuracies on large-scale high-dimensional datasets. We propose a Detail-Oriented Capsule Network (DECAPS) that combines the strength of CapsNets with several novel techniques to boost its classification accuracies. First, DECAPS uses an Inverted Dynamic Routing (IDR) mechanism to group lower-level capsules into heads before sending them to higher-level capsules. This strategy enables capsules to selectively attend to small but informative details within the data which may be lost during pooling operations in CNNs. Second, DECAPS employs a Peekaboo training procedure, which encourages the network to focus on fine-grained information through a second-level attention scheme. Finally, the distillation process improves the robustness of DECAPS by averaging over the original and attended image region predictions. We provide extensive experiments on the CheXpert and RSNA Pneumonia datasets to validate the effectiveness of DECAPS. Our networks achieve state-of-the-art accuracies not only in classification (increasing the average area under ROC curves from 87.24% to 92.82% on the CheXpert dataset) but also in the weakly-supervised localization of diseased areas (increasing average precision from 41.7% to 80% for the RSNA Pneumonia detection dataset).",20,[],7

2008.08692,cs,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to fraud detection problems in recent years, revealing the suspiciousness of nodes by aggregating their neighborhood information via different relations. However, few prior works have noticed the camouflage behavior of fraudsters, which could hamper the performance of GNN-based fraud detectors during the aggregation process. In this paper, we introduce two types of camouflages based on recent empirical studies, i.e., the feature camouflage and the relation camouflage. Existing GNNs have not addressed these two camouflages, which results in their poor performance in fraud detection problems. Alternatively, we propose a new model named CAmouflage-REsistant GNN (CARE-GNN), to enhance the GNN aggregation process with three unique modules against camouflages. Concretely, we first devise a label-aware similarity measure to find informative neighboring nodes. Then, we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to find the optimal amounts of neighbors to be selected. Finally, the selected neighbors across different relations are aggregated together. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world fraud datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL algorithm.

2003.03716,cs,"We demonstrate how we can practically incorporate multi-step future information into a decoder of maximum likelihood sequence models. We propose a ""k-step look-ahead"" module to consider the likelihood information of a rollout up to k steps. Unlike other approaches that need to train another value network to evaluate the rollouts, we can directly apply this look-ahead module to improve the decoding of any sequence model trained in a maximum likelihood framework. We evaluate our look-ahead module on three datasets of varying difficulties: IM2LATEX-100k OCR image to LaTeX, WMT16 multimodal machine translation, and WMT14 machine translation. Our look-ahead module improves the performance of the simpler datasets such as IM2LATEX-100k and WMT16 multimodal machine translation. However, the improvement of the more difficult dataset (e.g., containing longer sequences), WMT14 machine translation, becomes marginal. Our further investigation using the k-step look-ahead suggests that the more difficult tasks suffer from the overestimated EOS (end-of-sentence) probability. We argue that the overestimated EOS probability also causes the decreased performance of beam search when increasing its beam width. We tackle the EOS problem by integrating an auxiliary EOS loss into the training to estimate if the model should emit EOS or other words. Our experiments show that improving EOS estimation not only increases the performance of our proposed look-ahead module but also the robustness of the beam search.",20,[],7

To construct FDRN, we propose a new fast residual dense block (f-RDB) to retain the ability of local feature fusion and local residual learning of original RDB, which can reduce the computing efforts at the same time. After fully learning local residual dense features, we utilize the sum operation and several f-RDBs to define a new block termed global dense block (GDB) by imitating the construction of dense blocks to learn global dense residual features adaptively in a holistic way.

However, there are serious privacy and security concerns that may impede wide-spread adoption in many societies. Furthermore, these methods rely solely on proximity to patients, based on Bluetooth or GPS signal for example, ignoring lingering effects of virus, including COVID-19, present in the environment. This results in inaccurate risk assessment and incomplete contact tracing. A new system concept, called PrivyTRAC, preserves user privacy, increases security and improves accuracy of smartphone contact tracing. PrivyTRAC enhances users' and patients' privacy by letting users conduct self-evaluation based on the risk maps download to their smartphones. No user information is transmitted to external locations or devices, and no personally identifiable patient information is embedded in the risk maps as they are processed anonymized and aggregated locations of confirmed patients. The risk maps consider both spatial proximity and temporal effects to improve the accuracy of the infection risk estimation. Experiments conducted in the paper illustrate improvement of PrivyTRAC over proximity based methods in terms of true and false positives. An approach to further improve infection risk estimation by incorporating both positive and negative local test results from contacts of confirmed cases is also described.",20,[],7
2001.00004,cs,"Online algorithm has been an emerging area of interest for researchers in various domains of computer science. The online equation-machine list scheduling problem introduced by Graham has gained theoretical as well as practical significance in the development of competitive analysis as a performance measure for online algorithms. In this paper, we study and explore the performance of Graham's online \textitlist scheduling algorithm(LSA) for independent jobs. In the literature, \textitLSA has already been proved to be equation competitive, where equation is the number of machines. We present two new upper bound results on competitive analysis of \textitLSA. We obtain upper bounds on the competitive ratio of equation and equation respectively for practically significant two special classes of input job sequences. Our analytical results can motivate the practitioners to design improved competitive online algorithms for the equation-machine list scheduling problem by characterization of real life input sequences.",20,[],7
2006.11327,cs,"App Inventor is a popular block-based programming environment used by a wide audience, from K-12 to higher education, including end-users to create mobile applications to support their primary job or hobbies. Although learning computational thinking with App Inventor has been investigated, a question that remains is which programming concepts are typically used and how this compares to other block-based programming environments. Therefore, we explore the characteristics of App Inventor projects through a large-scale analysis of 88,606 apps from the App Inventor Gallery. We discovered that the size of App Inventor projects varies from projects with very few blocks to some surprisingly large projects with more than 60,000 blocks. In general, much fewer design components are used than programming blocks, as typically, to work properly, several programming blocks are necessary for each design component in an App Inventor project. In addition, we also compare our results with the analysis of 233,491 Scratch projects reported by Aivaloglou and Hermans [4]. Several differences can be observed, as in App Inventor projects events are more predominant, with lesser use of conditionals and loops. These findings may guide the decision on the adoption of App Inventor for teaching computing depending on the specific learning objectives or indicate the need for tailoring the curricula.",20,[],7

We find that current approaches prioritize accuracy over the individual learning process and often only support reflection post-gameplay. Our analysis identifies common reflective features, and we develop a set of open areas for future work. We discuss these promising directions towards engaging the community in developing more mechanics for reflection in educational games.",20,[],7

In this problem, the vertices in a given graph must be colored by using the least number of colors in such a way that a vertex has a different color than its neighbors. The problem, as well as its different variants, has been proven to be NP-Hard. Therefore, there are greedy algorithms in the literature aiming to use a small number of colors. These algorithms traverse the vertices and color them one by one. The vertex visit order has a significant impact on the number of colors used. In this work, we investigated if social network analytics metrics can be used to find this order. Our experiments showed that when closeness centrality is used to find vertex visit order, a smaller number of colors is used by the greedy algorithms.",20,[],7
2002.07033,cs,"Knowledge tracing, the act of modeling a student's knowledge through learning activities, is an extensively studied problem in the field of computer-aided education. Although models with attention mechanism have outperformed traditional approaches such as Bayesian knowledge tracing and collaborative filtering, they share two limitations. Firstly, the models rely on shallow attention layers and fail to capture complex relations among exercises and responses over time. Secondly, different combinations of queries, keys and values for the self-attention layer for knowledge tracing were not extensively explored. Usual practice of using exercises and interactions (exercise-response pairs) as queries and keys/values respectively lacks empirical support. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer based model for knowledge tracing, SAINT: Separated Self-AttentIve Neural Knowledge Tracing. SAINT has an encoder-decoder structure where exercise and response embedding sequence separately enter the encoder and the decoder respectively, which allows to stack attention layers multiple times. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to suggest an encoder-decoder model for knowledge tracing that applies deep self-attentive layers to exercises and responses separately. The empirical evaluations on a large-scale knowledge tracing dataset show that SAINT achieves the state-of-the-art performance in knowledge tracing with the improvement of AUC by 1.8% compared to the current state-of-the-art models.",20,[],7
2007.01520,cs,"Traditional approaches to quadruped control frequently employ simplified, hand-derived models. This significantly reduces the capability of the robot since its effective kinematic range is curtailed. In addition, kinodynamic constraints are often non-differentiable and difficult to implement in an optimisation approach. In this work, these challenges are addressed by framing quadruped control as optimisation in a structured latent space. A deep generative model captures a statistical representation of feasible joint configurations, whilst complex dynamic and terminal constraints are expressed via high-level, semantic indicators and represented by learned classifiers operating upon the latent space. As a consequence, complex constraints are rendered differentiable and evaluated an order of magnitude faster than analytical approaches. We validate the feasibility of locomotion trajectories optimised using our approach both in simulation and on a real-world ANYmal quadruped. Our results demonstrate that this approach is capable of generating smooth and realisable trajectories. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time latent space control has been successfully applied to a complex, real robot platform.",20,[],7

2005.06644,cs,"Programmatic advertising operates one of the most sophisticated and efficient service platforms on the Internet. However, the complexity of this ecosystem is the main cause of one of the most important problems in online advertising, the lack of transparency. This lack of transparency leads to subsequent problems such as advertising fraud, which causes billions of dollars in losses. In this paper we propose Ads.chain, a technological solution to the lack-of-transparency problem in programmatic advertising. Ads.chain extends the current effort of the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) in providing traceability in online advertising through the Ads.txt and Ads.cert solutions, addressing the limitations of these techniques. Ads.chain is (to the best of the authors' knowledge) the first solution that provides end-to-end cryptographic traceability at the ad transaction level. It is a communication protocol that can be seamlessly embedded in ad-tags and the OpenRTB protocol, the de-facto standards for communications in online advertising, allowing an incremental adoption by the industry. We have implemented Ads.chain and made the code publicly available. We assess the performance of Ads.chain through a thorough analysis in a lab environment that emulates a real ad delivery process at real-life throughputs. The obtained results show that Ads.chain can be implemented with limited impact on the hardware resources and marginal delay increments at the publishers lower than 0.20 milliseconds per ad space on webpages and 2.6 milliseconds at the programmatic advertising platforms. These results confirm that Ads.chain's impact on the user experience and the overall operation of the programmatic ad delivery process can be considered negligible.",20,[],7
2009.05290,cs,"We propose a self-supervised method for partial point set registration. While recent proposed learning-based methods have achieved impressive registration performance on the full shape observations, these methods mostly suffer from performance degradation when dealing with partial shapes. To bridge the performance gaps between partial point set registration with full point set registration, we proposed to incorporate a shape completion network to benefit the registration process. To achieve this, we design a latent code for each pair of shapes, which can be regarded as a geometric encoding of the target shape. By doing so, our model does need an explicit feature embedding network to learn the feature encodings. More importantly, both our shape completion network and the point set registration network take the shared latent codes as input, which are optimized along with the parameters of two decoder networks in the training process. Therefore, the point set registration process can thus benefit from the joint optimization process of latent codes, which are enforced to represent the information of full shape instead of partial ones. In the inference stage, we fix the network parameter and optimize the latent codes to get the optimal shape completion and registration results. Our proposed method is pure unsupervised and does not need any ground truth supervision. Experiments on the ModelNet40 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for partial point set registration.",20,[],7

Specifically, we develop a similarity measure that can quantify transference among tasks and use this quantity to both better understand the optimization dynamics of multi-task learning as well as improve overall learning performance. In the latter case, we propose two methods to leverage our transference metric. The first operates at a macro-level by selecting which tasks should train together while the second functions at a micro-level by determining how to combine task gradients at each training step.

(2) How does dimensionality reduction affect the quality of automated log clustering? (3) How does the criterion used for merging clusters in the clustering algorithm affect clustering quality?   Method: We replicate and extend earlier work on clustering system log files to assess its generalization to continuous deployment logs. We consider the optional inclusion of one of these dimensionality reduction techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).

2007.08740,cs,"The prediction and selection of lesion features are two important tasks in voxel-based neuroimage analysis. Existing multivariate learning models take two tasks equivalently and optimize simultaneously. However, in addition to lesion features, we observe that there is another type of feature, which is commonly introduced during the procedure of preprocessing steps, which can improve the prediction result. We call such a type of feature as procedural bias. Therefore, in this paper, we propose that the features/voxels in neuroimage data are consist of three orthogonal parts: lesion features, procedural bias, and null features. To stably select lesion features and leverage procedural bias into prediction, we propose an iterative algorithm (termed GSplit LBI) as a discretization of differential inclusion of inverse scale space, which is the combination of Variable Splitting scheme and Linearized Bregman Iteration (LBI). Specifically, with a variable the splitting term, two estimators are introduced and split apart, i.e. one is for feature selection (the sparse estimator) and the other is for prediction (the dense estimator). Implemented with Linearized Bregman Iteration (LBI), the solution path of both estimators can be returned with different sparsity levels on the sparse estimator for the selection of lesion features. Besides, the dense the estimator can additionally leverage procedural bias to further improve prediction results. To test the efficacy of our method, we conduct experiments on the simulated study and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.

2007.11571,cs,"Photo-realistic free-viewpoint rendering of real-world scenes using classical computer graphics techniques is challenging, because it requires the difficult step of capturing detailed appearance and geometry models. Recent studies have demonstrated promising results by learning scene representations that implicitly encode both geometry and appearance without 3D supervision. However, existing approaches in practice often show blurry renderings caused by the limited network capacity or the difficulty in finding accurate intersections of camera rays with the scene geometry. Synthesizing high-resolution imagery from these representations often requires time-consuming optical ray marching. In this work, we introduce Neural Sparse Voxel Fields (NSVF), a new neural scene representation for fast and high-quality free-viewpoint rendering. NSVF defines a set of voxel-bounded implicit fields organized in a sparse voxel octree to model local properties in each cell. We progressively learn the underlying voxel structures with a diffentiable ray-marching operation from only a set of posed RGB images. With the sparse voxel octree structure, rendering novel views can be accelerated by skipping the voxels containing no relevant scene content. Our method is over 10 times faster than the state-of-the-art (namely, NeRF) at inference time while achieving higher quality results. Furthermore, by utilizing an explicit sparse voxel representation, our method can easily be applied to scene editing and scene composition.

In this work, we take a step towards this noisy reality, developing point-goal navigation agents that rely on visual estimates of egomotion under noisy action dynamics. We find these agents outperform naive adaptions of current point-goal agents to this setting as well as those incorporating classic localization baselines. Further, our model conceptually divides learning agent dynamics or odometry (where am I?) from task-specific navigation policy (where do I want to go?). This enables a seamless adaption to changing dynamics (a different robot or floor type) by simply re-calibrating the visual odometry model -- circumventing the expense of re-training of the navigation policy.

2003.05251,cs,"How to make robots explainable has experienced a surge of interest in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) over the last three years, and, in HRI, there are many terms that refer to this concept, e.g., transparency, or legibility. One reason for this high variance in terminology is the unique array of modalities that embodied agents have access to when compared with non-embodied agents. Another reason is that, different authors use these terms in different ways. We, hence, review the existing literature in explainability and organize it by (1) providing an overview of existing definitions, by (2) showing how explainability is implemented and how it exploits different modalities, and by (3) showing how the impact of explainability is measured. Additionally, we present a list of open questions and challenges that highlight areas that require further investigation by the community.

2001.08839,cs,"Structured weight pruning is a representative model compression technique of DNNs for hardware efficiency and inference accelerations. Previous works in this area leave great space for improvement since sparse structures with combinations of different structured pruning schemes are not exploited fully and efficiently. To mitigate the limitations, we propose SS-Auto, a single-shot, automatic structured pruning framework that can achieve row pruning and column pruning simultaneously. We adopt soft constraint-based formulation to alleviate the strong non-convexity of l0-norm constraints used in state-of-the-art ADMM-based methods for faster convergence and fewer hyperparameters. Instead of solving the problem directly, a Primal-Proximal solution is proposed to avoid the pitfall of penalizing all weights equally, thereby enhancing the accuracy. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve ultra-high pruning rates while maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, significant inference speedup has been observed from the proposed framework through actual measurements on the smartphone.",20,[],7

2002.06737,cs,"Runtime Verification (RV) is a lightweight formal technique in which program or system execution is monitored and analyzed, to check whether certain properties are satisfied or violated after a finite number of steps. The use of RV has led to interest in deciding whether a property is monitorable: whether it is always possible for the satisfaction or violation of the property to be determined after a finite future continuation. However, classical two-valued monitorability suffers from two inherent limitations. First, a property can only be evaluated as monitorable or non-monitorable; no information is available regarding whether only one verdict (satisfaction or violation) can be detected. Second, monitorability is defined at the language-level and does not tell us whether satisfaction or violation can be detected starting from the current monitor state during system execution.   To address these limitations, this paper proposes a new notion of four-valued monitorability for equation-languages and applies it at the state-level. Four-valued monitorability is more informative than two-valued monitorability as a property can be evaluated as a four-valued result, denoting that only satisfaction, only violation, or both are active for a monitorable property. We can also compute state-level weak monitorability, i.e., whether satisfaction or violation can be detected starting from a given state in a monitor, which enables state-level optimizations of monitoring algorithms. Based on a new six-valued semantics, we propose procedures for computing four-valued monitorability of equation-regular languages, both at the language-level and at the state-level. We have developed a new tool that implements the proposed procedure for computing monitorability of LTL formulas.",20,[],7

2003.02979,cs,"We consider the problem of zero-shot coordination - constructing AI agents that can coordinate with novel partners they have not seen before (e.g. humans). Standard Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods typically focus on the self-play (SP) setting where agents construct strategies by playing the game with themselves repeatedly. Unfortunately, applying SP naively to the zero-shot coordination problem can produce agents that establish highly specialized conventions that do not carry over to novel partners they have not been trained with. We introduce a novel learning algorithm called other-play (OP), that enhances self-play by looking for more robust strategies, exploiting the presence of known symmetries in the underlying problem. We characterize OP theoretically as well as experimentally. We study the cooperative card game Hanabi and show that OP agents achieve higher scores when paired with independently trained agents.

Motivation of this work is study directional effects of the EM vector potential on anisotropy trajectory of the space time expansion scale factor. This problem is checked just for de Sitter inflationary epoch because of its importance in the expansion of the universe. By applying the dynamical system approach we investigate stability nature of the cosmic system in two different cases: (a) direction of the EM vector potential is parallel to equation direction of the spacetime and (b) it is perpendicular to equation direction. We obtained at stable critical points for some of obtained inflationary solutions the EM waves behave as dark energy in cases equation and equation where the anisotropy is negligible by expanding of the universe while there are some stable critical points with inflationary stable solutions in case equation for which the EM waves behave as baryonic visible matter with non-vanishing anisotropy.",20,[],13

One aspect of this is that threshold solutions themselves are self-similar and are, in a certain sense, unique. To an extent yet to be fully understood, the same phenomena persist beyond spherical symmetry. It is therefore desirable to construct models that exhibit such symmetry at the threshold of blow-up. Starting with deformations of the wave equation, we discuss models which have discretely self-similar threshold solutions. We study threshold solutions in the past light cone of the blow-up point. In spherical symmetry there is a sense in which a unique critical solution exists. Spherical numerical evolutions are also presented for more general models, and exhibit similar behavior.

However, in a equation dimensional spacetime, self-gravity leads to the formation of compact with a large gap of mass that includes white dwarf and Neutron Star. The results point also that beyond certain critical central pressure, the stars are unstable against gravitational collapse, and it ends in a black hole.

In such cases, radiative modes are spheroidal in nature. Here, common approaches to the estimation of spheroidal harmonic multipole moments are unified under a simple framework.

For any choice inside the estimated ranges, there is an acceptable concordance between the theoretical predictions and observations. Whereas the model is established based on some assumptions, it is vital to check their validity for the obtained values of the free parameters of the model. It is realized that the model is not self-consistent for all values of the ranges and sometimes the assumptions are violated.

2007.10601,gr-qc,"The Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (CCC) states that every singularity (except the cosmological one) must appear ""dressed"" in the universe. This statement was introduced by Roger Penrose (Penrose, 1969), meaning that every singularity (except the Big Bang) in the universe must be hidden inside an Event Horizon. Mathematically, this is described by the inequality equation (in geometrized unit system), with equation being the mass of the black hole, equation its charge and equation its specific angular momentum. Essentially, this three quantities determines uniquely a black hole, as stated by the no-hair theorem. We study the emission probability of a massive (equation) uncharged scalar wave packet, a semi-classical approximation for a particle, by a static, charged black hole. We show that for a few values of the mass equation (where equation is the fixed value for the mass and equation being a small variation to equation in the order of equation) with different values for equation and fixed charge equation for the black hole, the emission probability tends to zero once the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture is close to be violated, that is, when the emitted packet is such that the new quantity equation would violate the inequality equation.",20,[],13
2005.03258,gr-qc,"We study the recently reported qmetric (or zero-point-length) expressions of the Ricci (bi)scalar equation (namely, expressions of the Ricci scalar in a spacetime with a limit length equation built in), focusing specifically on the case of null separated events. A feature of these expressions is that, when considered in the coincidence limit equation, they generically exhibit a dependence on the geodesic along which the varying point equation approached equation, in particular on its tangent equation at equation, sort of memory of how equation went to equation. This fact creates in principle a tension with the meaning of the quantity equation, for this latter tells about curvature of spacetime as a whole at equation and should not depend on whatever vector we might happen to consider at equation. Here, we try to search for a framework in which these two apparently conflicting aspects might be consistently reconciled. We find a tentative sense in which this could be achieved, this coming, however, at the price of having a spacetime no longer arbitrary but somehow constrained. The constraint turns out to be in the form of a relation between the geometry of spacetime in the large (as compared to equation) scale and the matter content, namely as sort of field equations. This comes about thanks to something which turns out to mathematically coincide with (i.e. to be simply a reproposition of) the expression of balance of (matter and spacetime) exchanged heats, i.e. the thermodynamic variational principle from which the field equations have been reported to be derivable. This establishes a link between (this specific understanding of) consistency of the limit expression of equation on one side and (large scale) field equations on the other, this way reconnecting (once more) the latter to a small-scale quantum feature.",20,[],13

Although a single (primary) matter source is taken, due to the coupling between matter and equation gravity, an additional matter source appears, which mimics a perfect fluid or exotic matter. The solutions are also extended to the case of a scalar field model. The kinematical behavior of the model remains independent of equation gravity.

For an extended reference frame around the given light ray, we express the evolution of the direction equation in terms of the frame's kinematics, proving thereby that its expansion never spoils parallel transport, which bears on the unbiased inference of intrinsic properties of cosmological sources, such as, for instance, the polarization field of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). As an application of the newly derived laws, we consider a simple setup for a gravitational wave (GW) interferometer, showing that, despite the (kinematic) shear induced by the GW, the change in the final interference pattern is negligible since it turns out to be of the order of the ratio of the GW and laser frequencies.",20,[],13

Authors in the past have resorted instead to computer verifications, or to overly-complicated derivations, leaving undergraduate students in particular with the impression that this is a mysterious and mathematically inaccessible phenomenon. This is surprising because, as shown in the present note, it is possible to use a basic property of orthogonal Lorentz matrices and a judicious choice for the configuration of the relevant inertial frames to give a very transparent algebraic proof. It is pedagogically useful for physics students particularly at undergraduate level to explore this.

2010.15186,gr-qc,"It is expected that all astrophysical black holes in equilibrium are well described by the Kerr solution. Moreover, any black hole far away from equilibrium, such as one initially formed in a compact binary merger or by the collapse of a massive star, will eventually reach a final equilibrium Kerr state. At sufficiently late times in this process of reaching equilibrium, we expect that the black hole is modeled as a perturbation around the final state. The emitted gravitational waves will then be damped sinusoids with frequencies and damping times given by the quasi-normal mode spectrum of the final Kerr black hole. An observational test of this scenario, often referred to as black hole spectroscopy, is one of the major goals of gravitational wave astronomy. It was recently suggested that the quasi-normal mode description including the higher overtones might hold even right after the remnant black hole is first formed. At these times, the black hole is expected to be highly dynamical and non-linear effects are likely to be important. In this paper we investigate this remarkable scenario in terms of the horizon dynamics. Working with high accuracy simulations of a simple configuration, namely the head-on collision of two non-spinning black holes with unequal masses, we study the dynamics of the final common horizon in terms of its shear and its multipole moments. We show that they are indeed well described by a superposition of ringdown modes as long as a sufficiently large number of higher overtones are included.

Such a resonance could indicate the existence of a tetraquark that is a bound state of two b quarks and two equation antiquarks. The tetraquark search is performed for masses in the vicinity of four times the bottom quark mass, between 17.5 and 19.5 GeV, while a generic search for other resonances is performed for masses between 16.5 and 27 GeV.

These substructure observables are differentially measured for jets of varying resolution parameters from equation to equation and transverse momentum range equation GeVequation. These studies show that, at RHIC kinematics with increasing jet resolution parameter and jet energy, the equation distribution asymptotically converges to the DGLAP splitting kernel. The groomed jet radius measurements reflect a momentum-dependent narrowing of the jet structure for jets of a given resolution parameter, i.e., the larger the equation, the narrower the first split. For the first time, these fully corrected measurements are compared to leading order Monte Carlo generators and to state-of-the-art theoretical calculations at next-to-leading-log accuracy. We observe that RHIC-tuned PYTHIA 6 is able to quantitatively reproduce data whereas the LHC-tuned event generators, PYTHIA 8 and HERWIG 7, are unable to provide a simultaneous description of both the equation and equation, resulting in opportunities for fine parameter tuning of these models in \pp collisions at varying collision energies.

Cross-sections of associated production of a Higgs boson decaying into bottom quark pairs with an electroweak gauge boson, equation or equation, decaying into leptons are measured as a function of the gauge boson transverse momentum in kinematic fiducial volumes. The cross-section measurements are all consistent with the Standard Model expectations, and the total uncertainties vary from 30% in the high gauge boson transverse momentum regions to 85% in the low regions. Limits are subsequently set on the parameters of an effective Lagrangian sensitive to modifications of the equation and equation processes as well as the Higgs boson decay into equation.",20,[],12
2010.06552,hep-ex,"We report on an updated sensitivity for proton decay via equation at large, dual phase liquid argon time projection chambers (LAr TPCs). Our work builds on a previous study in which several nucleon decay channels have been simulated and analyzed [arXiv:hep-ph/0701101]. At the time several assumptions were needed to be made on the detector and the backgrounds. Since then, the community has made progress in defining these, and the computing power available enables us to fully simulate and reconstruct large samples in order to perform a better estimate of the sensitivity to proton decay. In this work, we examine the benchmark channel equation, which was previously found to be one of the cleanest channels. Using an improved neutrino event generator and a fully simulated LAr TPC detector response combined with a dedicated neural network for kaon identification, we demonstrate that a lifetime sensitivity of equation at equation confidence level can be reached at an exposure of equation in quasi-background-free conditions, confirming the superiority of the LAr TPC over other technologies to address the challenging proton decay modes.",20,[],12

The search is performed using events consistent with pair production of high-transverse-momentum top quarks and their subsequent decays into the fully hadronic final states. The analysis is optimized for resonances decaying into a equation pair with mass above 1.4 TeV, exploiting a dedicated multivariate technique with jet substructure to identify hadronically decaying top quarks using large-radius jets and evaluating the background expectation from data. No significant deviation from the background prediction is observed. Limits are set on the production cross-section times branching fraction for the new equation boson in a topcolor-assisted-technicolor model.

Based on a recent proposal to factorize physical effects, this Letter presents a double-differential cross-section measurement of the Lund jet plane using 139 fbequation of equation TeV proton-proton collision data collected with the ATLAS detector using jets with transverse momentum above 675 GeV.

Generally at the tree level, FCNC processes are not allowed in the SM but occurs at the loop levels. This gives an excellent hunting ground for new physics (NP). From various experimental studies it is found that the FCNC processes having quark level transition equation are challenging. Here, we investigate different kinematic observables like forward-backward asymmetry, differential branching ratio and lepton polarization asymmetry for semileptonic rare B decay modes equation and equation (equation) considering the contribution of Z-mediated FCNC. A noticeable deviation of the observables for these decay channels from the SM value is found because of non-universal equation-equation coupling.",20,[],2

As an important application we consider equation production at the LHC, more precisely the full leptonic process equation with equation, and we present resummed predictions for differential distributions in presence of fiducial selection cuts. In particular, we resum the transverse-momentum spectrum of the equation pair at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NequationLL) accuracy and match it to the integrated NNLO cross section. The transverse-momentum spectrum of the leading jet in equation production is calculated at NNLONNLL accuracy.

We observe that, compared to other processes in the class of two electroweak (EW) vector boson production in association with two jets, more exclusive cuts are needed in order to suppress the SM QCD-induced background channel. As expected, the NLO QCD corrections reduce the scale uncertainties considerably. Using a well-motivated dynamical scale choice, we find moderate equation-factors for the EW-induced process while the QCD-induced channel receives much larger corrections.

After considering the equation-meson lifetime, we give the branching fractions of equation with equation, our predictions also agree with BES-III collaboration within errors, especially for equation decay process.

The model has both active and inert Higgs superfields and by imposing discrete symmetries one can generate two DM candidates. We show that the lightest higgsinos of the active and inert sectors give a viable setup for two-component DM. We also illustrate the scope of both direct and indirect detection experiments in extracting such a DM sector.

2009.13537,hep-ph,"Building UV completions of lepton-number-violating effective operators has proved to be a useful way of studying and classifying models of Majorana neutrino mass. In this paper we describe and implement an algorithm that systematises this model-building procedure. We use the algorithm to generate computational representations of all of the tree-level completions of the operators up to and including mass-dimension 11. Almost all of these correspond to models of radiative neutrino mass. Our work includes operators involving derivatives, updated estimates for the bounds on the new-physics scale associated with each operator, an analysis of various features of the models, and a look at some examples. We find that a number of operators do not admit any completions not also generating lower-dimensional operators or larger contributions to the neutrino mass, ruling them out as playing a dominant role in the neutrino-mass generation. Additionally, we show that there are at most five models containing three or fewer exotic multiplets that predict new physics that must lie below 100 TeV. Accompanying this work we also make available a searchable database containing all of our results and the code used to find the completions.

2008.10791,hep-ph,"We study the noncommutativity of different orders of zero energy-momentum limit pertaining to the axial chemical potential in the chiral magnetic effect. While this noncommutativity issue originates from the pinching singularity at one-loop order, it cannot be removed by introducing a damping term to the fermion propagators. The physical reason is that modifying the propagator alone would violate the axial-vector Ward identity and as a result a modification of the longitudinal component of the axial-vector vertex is required, which contributes to CME. The pinching singularity with free fermion propagators was then taken over by the singularity stemming from the dressed axial-vector vertex. We show this mechanism by a concrete example. Moreover, we proved in general the vanishing CME in the limit order that the static limit was taken prior to the homogeneous limit in the light of Coleman-Hill theorem for a static external magnetic field. For the opposite limit that the homogeneous limit is taken first, we show that the nonvanishing CME was a consequence of the nonrenormalizability of chiral anomaly for an arbitrary external magnetic field.",20,[],2

Here, equation denotes the axial-vector mesons equation and equation with mixing angle equation in the quark-flavor basis. The observables such as branching ratios, direct CP violations, and polarization fractions of the equation decays are predicted for the first time. We find that: (a) the almost pure penguin modes equation have large branching ratios in the order of equation due to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa enhancement and generally constructive interferences between the amplitudes of equation and equation with equation and equation being the quark-flavor states of equation mesons; (b) the observables receive important contributions from the weak annihilation diagrams in the PQCD approach. In particular, without the annihilation contributions, the equation branching ratio will decrease about 81% and its longitudinal polarization fraction will reduce around 43%; (c) the dependence of the equation decay rates on equation exhibits some interesting line-shapes, whose confirmations would be helpful to constrain the determination of equation inversely.

For the Sun, depending on the magnetic field profile plasmon-axion conversion can dominate over Primakoff production at low energies (equationeV). This both provides a new axion source for future helioscopes and, in the event of discovery, would probe the magnetic field structure of the Sun.

Since the Xenon1T detector does not discriminate between electrons and photons, such events would be interpreted as excess of the keV electrons. Indirect constraints from dark matter annihilation are avoided for light mediators of equation that have sizable couplings to neutrinos.

To be definite, we introduce the mass term at equation and study the time evolution of the lepton family number for the later time. Since the operator in flavor eigenstate is continuously connected to that of the mass eigenstate, the creation and annihilation operators for flavor eigenstates are related to those of mass eigenstates.

The meson-meson scattering state and tetraquark molecular state both have four valence quarks, which form two color-neutral clusters, we cannot distinguish the contributions based on the two color-neutral clusters in the factorizable Feynman diagrams. Lucha, Melikhov and Sazdjian assert that the contributions at the order equation with equation in the operator product expansion, which are factorizable in the color space, are exactly canceled out by the meson-meson scattering states at the hadron side, the tetraquark molecular states begin to receive contributions at the order equation. Such an assertion is questionable, we refute the assertion in details, and choose an axialvector current and a tensor current to examine the outcome of the assertion. After detailed analysis, we observe that the meson-meson scattering states cannot saturate the QCD sum rules, while the tetraquark molecular states can saturate the QCD sum rules. The Landau equation is of no use to study the Feynman diagrams in the QCD sum rules for the tetraquark molecular states, the tetraquark molecular states begin to receive contributions at the order equation rather than at the order equation.",20,[],2

Since neutrinos have a tiny but finite mass they can undergo decay both visibly and invisibly. The effect of invisible decay of the third mass eigen state equation on the sensitivity to equation is analysed here using atmospheric neutrino and anti-neutrino events. Effects of detector resolutions and systematic uncertainties are studied to identify the optimum resolutions and efficiencies required by a detector to obtain a significant sensitivity even in presence of decay.,20,[],2

The high energy effective provides a field theory framework to systematically factorize QCD scattering amplitudes and related theories in the limit of high center of mass energies. After a short review of the underlying concepts, we address the question how the high energy effective action can be used for actual calculations. As an explicit example we review the derivation of the gluon Regge trajectory up to 2 loop.

Quark-gluon partonic channels are included for the first time in the calculation, and our results are combined with NNLO predictions to the quark annihilation channel at the fully differential level. The computed corrections, which are formally of equation, increase the NNLO cross section by only about 2%, but have an impact on the shapes of kinematical distributions, in part due to the jet veto, which is usually applied to reduce the top-quark background.

A single lepton transverse momentum cut is needed in the case of electroweak corrections to avoid a double singularity in the photon induced diagrams, and the dependence on the value of this cut is examined. We compare the electroweak corrections to the angular coefficients to the NLO QCD corrections, including the single lepton cut. The size of the single lepton cut is found to affect the two coefficients equation and equation to largest extent. The relative size of the electroweak corrections to the coefficients is moderate for all single lepton cut values, and by extrapolation to the inclusive results, is moderate also for the full dilepton phase space case.

We reach a sum of three-generation neutrino massess at: equation. This prediction is supported by the result of the latest cosmological observation, i.e. the 95\% C.L. upper bound equation determined by the Planck data. In our proposal of the modified Higgs mechanism, the Higgs vacua break twice, such that, the very minuteness of the extra Higgs vacuum breaking explains the origin of the very minuteness of neutrino masses, while the relative greatness of the standard Higgs vacuum breaking is recognized as the origin of the relative greatness of charged lepton masses.

We employ exact gluon emission and absorption vertices, and hence the gluon is not required to carry very small light-cone momentum, or to be collinear to the emitting quark. This is then used to derive expressions for the color charge density correlator equation at equation due to the emission of a gluon by one of the quarks in light-cone gauge. It depends in a non-trivial way on the impact parameter and on the relative momentum of the two gluon probes, rather than to be simply proportional to the one-body particle density in the proton. We verify that the correlator satisfies the Ward identity and that it is independent of the renormalization scale, i.e. that ultraviolet divergences cancel. Our expressions provide initial conditions, at equation, for Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution of the C-even part of the dipole scattering matrix to higher energies.

Correcting an earlier estimate of equation, we show that this self-intersection region originates from the spatially coarse-grained \sl central part of a(n) (anti)caloron. A \sl BPS monopole of core radius equation, isolated from its antimonopole by repulsion externally invoked through a transient shift of (anti)caloron holonomy (pair creation), is trapped within this region, contributes equation7.5 % to the region's rest mass equation, and carries one unit of U(1) charge: this monopole indeterministically varies its position and core-vibrates at a frequency equation via perturbations -- facilitated by Planck's quantum of action equation -- of its classical, static and stable field configuration. The quantity equation effectively acts within the region of self-intersection by one unit of winding (equation) around the 4D point of maximum action density prescribed by the fundamental (anti)caloronic SU(2) gauge field.

The Yang-Mills coupling of the equation is positive and infinite, while that on the equation goes to zero. We also show that the odd equation case has somewhat different behavior. We then study the equation pure Chern-Simons theory. While the eigenvalue density is only found numerically, we show that its width equals equation in units of the inverse sphere radius, which allows us to find the leading correction to the free energy when turning on the Yang-Mills term. We then consider equation theories with an antisymmetric hypermultiplet and equation fundamental hypermultiplets and carry out a similar analysis. We present evidence that the equation theories have a fifth order phase transition in the inverse coupling at their superconformal fixed point.

We trace the source of the corrections to a failure of the assumptions used in the replica trick derivation of the QES prescription, and show that a more careful derivation correctly computes the corrections. Using tools from one-shot quantum Shannon theory (smooth min- and max-entropies), we generalize these results to a set of refined conditions that determine whether the QES prescription holds. We find similar refinements to the conditions needed for entanglement wedge reconstruction (EWR), and show how EWR can be reinterpreted as the task of one-shot quantum state merging (using zero-bits rather than classical bits), a task gravity is able to achieve optimally efficiently.",20,[],4
2002.10807,hep-th,We study the gauge invariant 't Hooft operator in canonical formalism for Yang-Mills theory as well as the equation Super Yang-Mills theory. It is shown that the spectrum of the 't Hooft operator labeled by the dual representation of the gauge group is the same as the spectrum of the Wilson operator labeled by the same representation. So it is possible to construct a unitary operator equation making the two kinds of loop operators transformed into each other. S-duality transformation could be realized by the operator equation. We compute the supersymmetry variations of the loop operators with the fermionic couplings turned off. The result is consistent with the expectation that the action of equation should make supercharges transform with a equation phase.,20,[],4
2010.06106,hep-th,"We study the contact terms that appear in the correlation functions of exactly marginal operators using the AdS/CFT correspondence. It is known that CFT with an exactly marginal deformation requires the existence of the contact terms with their coefficients having a geometrical interpretation in the context of conformal manifolds. We show that the AdS/CFT correspondence captures properly the mathematical structure of the correlation functions that is expected from the CFT analysis. For this purpose, we employ holographic RG to formulate a most general setup in the bulk for describing an exactly marginal deformation. The resultant bulk equations of motion are nonlinear and solved perturbatively to obtain the on-shell action. We compute three- and four-point functions of the exactly marginal operators using the GKP-Witten prescription, and show that they match with the expected results precisely. The cut-off surface prescription in the bulk serves as a regularization scheme for conformal perturbation theory in the boundary CFT.

2011.09043,hep-th,"Quantum extremal islands reproduce the unitary Page curve of an evaporating black hole. This has been derived by including replica wormholes in the gravitational path integral, but for the transient, evaporating black holes most relevant to Hawking's paradox, these wormholes have not been analyzed in any detail. In this paper we study replica wormholes for black holes formed by gravitational collapse in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, and confirm that they lead to the island rule for the entropy. The main technical challenge is that replica wormholes rely on a Euclidean path integral, while the quantum extremal islands of an evaporating black hole exist only in Lorentzian signature. Furthermore, the Euclidean equations are non-local, so it is unclear how to bridge the gap between the Euclidean path integral and the local, Lorentzian dynamics of an evaporating black hole. We address these issues with Schwinger-Keldysh techniques and show how the non-local equations reduce to the local `boundary particle' description in special cases.",20,[],4
2006.14025,hep-th,"Starting with a gentle approach to the AGT correspondence from its 6d origin, these notes provide a wide survey of the literature on numerous extensions of the correspondence. This is the writeup of the lectures given at the Winter School YRISW 2020, to appear in a special issue of JPhysA.   Class S is a wide class of 4d equation supersymmetric gauge theories (ranging from super-QCD to non-Lagrangian theories) obtained by twisted compactification of 6d equation superconformal theories on a Riemann surface. This 6d construction yields the Coulomb branch and SW geometry of class S theories, geometrizes S-duality, and leads to the AGT correspondence, which states that many observables of class S theories are equal to 2d CFT correlators. For instance, the four-sphere partition function of 4d equation SU(2) superconformal quiver theories is equal to a Liouville CFT correlator of primary operators.   Extensions of the AGT correspondence abound: asymptotically-free gauge theories and Argyres-Douglas theories correspond to irregular CFT operators, quivers with higher-rank gauge groups and non-Lagrangian tinkertoys such as equation correspond to Toda CFT correlators, and nonlocal operators (Wilson-'t Hooft loops, surface operators, domain walls) correspond to Verlinde networks, degenerate primary operators, braiding and fusion kernels, and Riemann surfaces with boundaries.",20,[],4

We use two different methods to arrive at expressions for asymptotic structure constants for general states in the theory utilising modular properties of the torus one-point function. We then concentrate on the BMS highest weight representation, and derive a host of new results, the most important of which is the BMS torus block. In a particular limit of large weights, we derive the leading and sub-leading pieces of the BMS torus block, which we then use to rederive an expression for the asymptotic structure constants for BMS primaries.

2003.12594,hep-th,"Recently a dynamical selection mechanism for vacua based on search optimization was proposed in the context of false-vacuum eternal inflation on the landscape. The search algorithm, defined by local vacuum transitions, is optimal in regions of the landscape where the dynamics are tuned at criticality, with de Sitter vacua having an average lifetime of order their Page time. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the nature of the dynamical phase transition at the Page lifetime. We focus on a finite region of the landscape, which exchanges volume with the rest of the landscape and as such acts as an open system. Through a change of variables the master equation governing the comoving volume of de Sitter vacua is mapped to a stochastic equation for coupled overdamped stochastic oscillators -- the well-known Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The rest of the landscape, which acts as an environment, is assumed to result in a non-vanishing driving term for all sites in the region with uncorrelated, white noise fluctuations (though not necessarily Gaussian). We first show that the static susceptibility of the oscillators diverges as the average lifetime of de Sitter vacua approaches the Page time. Thus, optimal regions of the landscape are most susceptible to volume influx from their environing landscape. We then show that the displacement fluctuations for the oscillators exhibit a equation power spectrum over a broad range of frequencies, precisely at the critical Page lifetime distribution. A equation power spectrum is a hallmark of non-equilibrium systems at criticality. In analogy with sand avalanches in the abelian sandpile or neuronal avalanches in the brain, de Sitter vacua at criticality can be thought of as undergoing scale invariant volume fluctuation avalanches.",20,[],4

This relates the deformed system and the initial one by a worldsheet coordinate transformation, which becomes a time dependent canonical map in the Hamiltonian treatment. The deformed Hamiltonian defines the string energy and we express it in terms of the chiral Hamiltonians of the initial 2d CFT.

The most general deformation also breaks the Lorentz symmetry but preserves integrability in the examples we consider. In this paper, we focus on colour-twist operators in the fishnet model. We exemplify our approach for the simplest colour-twist operators with one and two scalar fields, which we study non-perturbatively using field-theoretical as well as integrability methods, finding a perfect match.

Requiring that the cutoff exceeds current theoretical and observational bounds shows that the new scalar potential terms allowed by liberated supergravity can neither change the cosmological constant predicted by supergravity by any observable amount, nor give measurable contributions to particle masses. We show that it is nevertheless possible to define a simple liberated supergravity model of slow roll inflation valid up to energy scales that are well above the Hubble parameter during inflation and exceeds observable limits after inflation. The key to constructing a viable model is to change the supersymmetry breaking scale, from a Planck-scale value during inflation, to TeV-scale after inflation.",20,[],4
2003.02857,hep-th,"In conformal field theories (CFTs) of dimension equation, two-dimensional (2d) conformal defects are characterised in part by central charges defined via the defect's contribution to the trace anomaly.

In the latter case we propose that defect central charges appear in an overall normalisation factor, as part of the SUSY Casimir energy. For 2d half-BPS defects in 4d equation SCFTs and in the 6d equation SCFT we obtain novel, exact results for defect central charges using existing results for partition functions computed using SUSY localisation, SUSY indices, and correspondences to 2d Liouville, Toda, and equation-deformed Yang-Mills theories. Some of our results for defect central charges agree with those obtained previously via holography, showing that the latter are not just large-equation and/or strong-coupling limits, but are exact.

Introducing homological information from equation produces a stronger invariant, equation, a module over the group ring of equation. The authors previously defined the Laplacian modules equation and polynomials equation associated to a Tait graph equation and its dual equation, and showed that the pairs equation, equation are isotopy invariants of equation. The relationship between equation and the Laplacian modules is described and used to prove that equation and equation are equal when equation is a torus.",20,[],0

2009.11578,math,"The question we propose to answer throughout this paper is the following: Given an isogeny class of Drinfeld modules over a finite field, what are the orders of the corresponding endomorphism algebra (which is an isogeny invariant) that occur as endomorphism ring of a Drinfeld module in that isogeny class? It is worth mentioning that this question is different from the ones investigated by the authors Kuhn, Pink in [6] and Garai, Papikian in [3]. The former authors rather provided an answer to the question, given a Drinfeld module letter, how does one efficiently compute the endomorphism ring of letter? The importance of our question resides in the fact that it might be very helpful to better understand isogeny graphs of Drinfeld modules of higher rank (r > 2) and may be reopen the debate concerning the application to isogeny-based cryptography. We answer that question for the case whereby the endomorphism algebra is a field by providing a necessary and sufficient condition for a given order to be the endomorphism ring of a Drinfeld module. We apply our result to rank r = 3 Drinfeld modules and explicitly compute those orders occurring as endomorphism rings of rank 3 Drinfeld modules over a finite field.",20,[],0
2009.07048,math,"3D-facets of the Delone cells representing the deep and shallow holes of the root lattice D6 which tile the six-dimensional Euclidean space in an alternating order are projected into three-dimensional space. They are classified into six Mosseri-Sadoc tetrahedral tiles of edge lengths 1 and golden ratio (tau) with faces normal to the 5-fold and 3-fold axes. The icosahedron, dodecahedron and icosidodecahedron whose vertices are obtained from the fundamental weights of the icosahedral group are dissected in terms of six tetrahedra. A set of four tiles are composed out of six fundamental tiles, faces of which, are normal to the 5-fold axes of the icosahedral group. It is shown that the 3D-Euclidean space can be tiled face-to-face with maximal face coverage by the composite tiles with an inflation factor tau generated by an inflation matrix. We note that dodecahedra with edge lengths of 1 and tau naturally occur already in the second and third order of the inflations.

Under suitable assumptions, an autonomous characterization is obtained for the marginal distribution of the dynamics of the neighborhood of a typical node in terms of a novel stochastic differential equation we call the local equation.This equation describes a finite-dimensional non-Markovian stochastic process whose infinitesimal evolution at any time depends not only on the structure and current state of the neighborhood, but also on the conditional law of the current state given the past of the neighborhood process until that time. Such marginal distributions are of interest because they arise as weak limits of both marginal distributions and empirical measures of interacting diffusions on many sequences of sparse random graphs, including the configuration model and Erdos-Renyi graphs whose average degrees converge to a finite non-zero limit. The results obtained complement classical results in the mean-field regime, which characterize the limiting dynamics of homogeneous interacting diffusions on complete graphs, as the number of nodes goes to infinity, in terms of a corresponding nonlinear Markov process. However, in the sparse graph setting, the topology of the graph matters, and the analysis requires a completely different approach. Important ingredients of the proofs include conditional independence and symmetry properties for particle trajectories on unimodular Galton-Watson trees, a stochastic analytic result on projections of Ito processes, and a recursive construction for establishing well-posedness of the local equation.",20,[],0
2004.12553,math,"We show how to efficiently compute the derivative (when it exists) of the solution map of log-log convex programs (LLCPs). These are nonconvex, nonsmooth optimization problems with positive variables that become convex when the variables, objective functions, and constraint functions are replaced with their logs. We focus specifically on LLCPs generated by disciplined geometric programming, a grammar consisting of a set of atomic functions with known log-log curvature and a composition rule for combining them. We represent a parametrized LLCP as the composition of a smooth transformation of parameters, a convex optimization problem, and an exponential transformation of the convex optimization problem's solution. The derivative of this composition can be computed efficiently, using recently developed methods for differentiating through convex optimization problems. We implement our method in CVXPY, a Python-embedded modeling language and rewriting system for convex optimization. In just a few lines of code, a user can specify a parametrized LLCP, solve it, and evaluate the derivative or its adjoint at a vector. This makes it possible to conduct sensitivity analyses of solutions, given perturbations to the parameters, and to compute the gradient of a function of the solution with respect to the parameters.

If the current iterate is sufficiently close to the central path with a sufficiently small value of the barrier parameter, the method switches to the standard version of ADMM. We show that Centering ADMM (not employing a dynamic update of the penalty parameter) has global convergence properties.

Our proof employs a nonlinear energy method built from the natural energy dissipation structure of the problem. Numerous difficulties arise due to the dissipative-conservative structure of the problem. Indeed, the dissipation fails to be coercive over the energy, which itself is weakly coupled in the sense that, while it provides estimates for the fluid velocity and microstructure angular velocity, it only provides control of two of the six components of the microinertia tensor. To overcome these problems, our method relies on a delicate combination of two distinct tiers of energy-dissipation estimates, together with transport-like advection-rotation estimates for the microinertia.

They provide a bridge between dual spaces of Lie algebras equation with linear Poisson brackets and polyhedral cones which parametrize the canonical bases of irreducible modules of equation.   We generalize the construction of partial tropicalizations to allow for arbitrary cluster charts, and apply it to questions in symplectic geometry. For each regular coadjoint orbit of a compact group equation, we construct an exhaustion by symplectic embeddings of toric domains. As a by product we arrive at a conjectured formula for Gromov width of regular coadjoint orbits. We prove similar results for multiplicity free equation-spaces.",20,[],0

2007.03546,math,"The kernel relation equation on the lattice equation of varieties of completely regular semigroups has been a central component in many investigations into the structure of equation. However, apart from the equation-class of the trivial variety, which is just the lattice of varieties of bands, the detailed structure of kernel classes has remained a mystery until recently. Kad'ourek [RK2] has shown that for two large classes of subvarieties of equation their kernel classes are singletons. Elsewhere (see [RK1], [RK2], [RK3]) we have provided a detailed analysis of the kernel classes of varieties of abelian groups. Here we study more general kernel classes.

Drives are considered over a range of frequencies both outside (below and above) and inside the band of linear modes. We identify a number of discrete breathers both existing in the bulk and also (predominantly) ones arising at the domain boundaries, localized either along the arm-chair or along the zig-zag edges. The types of edge-localized breathers observed and computed emerge in distinct frequency bands near the Dirac-point frequency of the dispersion surface while driving the lattice subharmonically (in a spatially homogeneous manner).

2008.12394,nlin,"The paper addresses compact oscillatory states (compact breathers) in translationally-invariant lattices with flat dispersion bands. The compact breathers appear in such systems even in the linear approximation. If the interactions are nonlinear, but comply with the flat-band symmetry, the compact breather solutions exist, but can lose their stability for certain parameter values. As benchmark nonlinear potentials, we use the equation-FPU (Fermi-Pasta-Ulam) and vibro-impact models. Loss of stability is numerically observed to occur through either pitchfork or Hopf bifurcations. The loss of stability can occur through two qualitatively different mechanisms -- through internal instability in the basic lattice elements, or through interaction of the compact breather with the linear passband of the lattice. The former scenario is more typical for high-amplitude breathers, and the latter -- for low amplitudes. For the high-amplitude case, insights into the nature of compact-mode loss-of-stability are obtained by resorting to the limit of a piecewise-linear system, where interactions are represented by conservative impacts. This issue calls for detailed introspection into integrability of piecewise-linear (impacting) systems and their relation to the smooth system.

2010.07876,nlin,"Weakly coupled limit cycle oscillators can be reduced into a phase model using phase reduction approach, and the phase model itself is helpful to analyze a synchronization. For example, phase model of two oscillators is one-dimensional differential equation for the evolution of a phase difference, and an existence of fixed points determines frequency-locking solutions. By treating each oscillator as a black-box possessing a single-input single-output one can investigate various control algorithms to change the synchronization of the oscillators. In particular, we are interested in a delayed feedback control algorithm, which applied to oscillator after the phase reduction gives the same phase model as of the control-free case, yet a coupling strength is rescaled. The conventional delayed feedback control is limited to change a magnitude but not a sign of the coupling strength. In this work we present modification of the delayed feedback algorithm supplemented by an additional unstable degree of freedom, which is able to change the sign of the coupling strength. Various numerical calculations performed with Landau-Stuart and FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators show successful switching between an in-phase and an anti-phase synchronization using provided control algorithm.

Focusing our analysis on the cohort of the largest rogue waves, we find their practically identical dynamical and statistical properties for both systems, that strongly suggests that the main mechanism of rogue wave formation for the modulational instability case is multi-soliton interaction.

Minimization is realized via gradient-descent method. However, the derivation of the gradient with respect to time-delay is not accurate. In particular, a scalar factor is omitted. The absolute value of the scalar factor is not crucial, as it only changes the speed of the gradient method. On the other hand, the factor's sign changes the gradient direction, therefore for negative value of the multiplier the gradient-decent becomes gradient-ascent method and fail power minimization.

Recently, a multilayer network has been realized as a better suited framework for the representation of complex systems having multiple types of interactions among the same set of constituents. This article shows that by tuning the properties of one layer (network) of a multilayer network, one can regulate the dynamical behavior of another layer (network). By taking an example of a multiplex network comprising two different types of networked Kuramoto oscillators representing two different layers, this article attempts to provide a glimpse of opportunities and emerging phenomena multiplexing can induce which is otherwise not possible for a network in isolation.

2010.16107,nlin,"Phase dynamics are used ubiquitously to describe dynamical systems. In coupled systems they are mostly reduced to the weak coupling lmit.

This notion is tested on a model of all-to-all coupled Rayleigh oscillators. In the second stage, the weak coupling limit is investigated with the Kuramoto model and an added group concept. Using one attractive and one repulsive group results in an interesting solitary state, situated between full and self-consistent partial synchrony.

2010.13174,nlin,"Investigating by direct numerical simulations the dynamics of the damped and forced nonlinear Schrodinger equation in the presence of a time periodic forcing and for certain parametric regimes, we show that the wave-number of a plane-wave initial condition dictates the number of emerged Peregrine type rogue waves at the early stages of modulation instability. Another dynamical feature is that the formation of these events gives rise to the same number of transient ""triangular"" spatio-temporal patterns, each of which is reminiscent of the one emerging in the dynamics of the integrable NLS in its semi-classical limit, with vanishing initial conditions. The effects of the various parameters in modifying the above behavior are also discussed, and found to be far from its integrable limit counterpart. Furthermore, we find that the equation- norm of the spatial derivative and the equation-norm of the solution provide diagnostics for the time of appearance of rogue waves as local extrema in their evolution.

This is achieved by using the delay-induced resonance, in which the time delay replaces one of the two periodic forcings present in the vibrational resonance.

This allows us to investigate phenomena described by the Stuart-Landau ensemble, such as clustering and cluster singularities, in the lower-dimensional center manifold, providing further insights into the symmetry-broken dynamics of coupled oscillators. We show that cluster singularities in the Stuart-Landau ensemble correspond to vanishing quadratic terms in the center manifold dynamics. In addition, they act as organizing centers for the saddle-node bifurcations creating unbalanced cluster states as well for the transverse bifurcations altering the cluster stability. Furthermore, we show that bistability of different solutions with the same cluster-size distribution can only occur when either cluster contains at least equation of the oscillators, independent of the system parameters.",20,[],9
2009.13126,nlin,"Tipping in multistable systems occurs usually by varying the input slightly, resulting in the output switching to an often unsatisfactory state. This phenomenon is manifested in thermoacoustic systems. This thermoacoustic instability may lead to the disintegration of rocket engines, gas turbines and aeroengines, so it is necessary to design control measures for its suppression. It was speculated that such unwanted instability states may be dodged by changing quickly enough the bifurcation parameters. Thus, in this work, based on a fundamental mathematical model of thermoacoustic systems driven by colored noise, the corresponding Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation of the amplitude is derived by using a stochastic averaging method. A transient dynamical behavior is identified through a probability density analysis. We find that the rate of change of parameters and the correlation time of the noise are helpful to dodge thermoacoustic instability, while a relatively large noise intensity is a disadvantageous factor. In addition, power-law relationships between the maximum amplitude and the noise parameters are explored, and the probability of successfully dodging a thermoacoustic instability is calculated.

2005.12708,nlin,"The small dispersion limit of the focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation with periodic initial conditions is studied analytically and numerically. First, through a comprehensive set of numerical simulations, it is demonstrated that solutions arising from a certain class of initial conditions, referred to as ""periodic single-lobe"" potentials, share the same qualitative features, which also coincide with those of solutions arising from localized initial conditions. The spectrum of the associated scattering problem in each of these cases is then numerically computed, and it is shown that such spectrum is confined to the real and imaginary axes of the spectral variable in the semiclassical limit. This implies that all nonlinear excitations emerging from the input have zero velocity, and form a coherent nonlinear condensate. Finally, by employing a formal Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin expansion for the scattering eigenfunctions, asymptotic expressions for the number and location of the bands and gaps in the spectrum are obtained, as well as corresponding expressions for the relative band widths and the number of ""effective solitons"". These results are shown to be in excellent agreement with those from direct numerical computation of the eigenfunctions.

2001.02269,nlin,"One of the main tasks in the study of financial and economic processes is forecasting and analysis of the dynamics of these processes. Within this task lie important research questions including how to determine the qualitative properties of the dynamics and how best to estimate quantitative indicators.   These questions can be studied both empirically and theoretically. In the empirical approach, one considers the real data represented by time series, identifies patterns of their dynamics, and then forecasts short- and long-term behavior of the process. The second approach is based on postulating the laws of dynamics for the process, deriving mathematical dynamic models based on these laws, and conducting subsequent analytical investigation of the dynamics generated by the models.   To implement these approaches, both numerical and analytical methods can be used. It should be noted that while numerical methods make it possible to study complex models, the possibility of obtaining reliable results using them is significantly limited due to calculations being performed only over finite-time intervals, numerical errors, and the unbounded space of initial data sets. In turn, analytical methods allow researchers to overcome these problems and to obtain exact qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the process dynamics. However, their effective applications are often limited to low-dimensional models. In this paper, we develop analytical methods for the study of deterministic dynamic systems. These methods make it possible not only to obtain analytical stability criteria and to estimate limiting behavior, but also to overcome the difficulties related to implementing reliable numerical analysis of quantitative indicators.

Here, we investigate how to improve stochastic continuation techniques by adaptively choosing the parameters of the algorithm. This allows one to obtain bifurcation diagrams quite accurately, especially near bifurcation points. We introduce lifting techniques which generate microscopic states with a naturally grown structure, which can be crucial for a reliable evaluation of macroscopic quantities. We show how to calculate fixed points of fluctuating functions by employing suitable linear fits. This procedure offers a simple measure of the statistical error.

This thermodynamic limit leads us to a dynamical system with an additional hysteretic force in the form of a play operator. By using methods from general chaos theory, piecewise-smooth system theory and statistics we investigate the chaotic behavior of the dynamical system for a few spins and also in case of a larger number of spins by calculating bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, fractal dimensions and self-averaging properties.

We also find the low-lying families of bulk and surface nonlinear modes and their bifurcation diagrams. Here the phenomenology is similar for all exponents and resembles what has been observed in other discrete evolution equations, such as the DNLS. The propagation of an initially localized magnetic excitation is always ballistic, with a `speed' that is computed in exact form as a function of the fractional exponent. For a given exponent, it increases with an increase in coupling up to a critical coupling value, beyond which the ballistic speed could diverge inside the fractional interval equation. Examination of the modulational instability shows that it tends to increase with an increase in the fractional exponent, where the decay proceeds via the formation of filamentary structures that merge eventually and form pure radiation. The dynamical selftrapping around an initially localized excitation increases with the fractional exponent, but it also shows a degree of trapping in the linear limit.

Based on Helmholtz's theorem, the Hamilton function of the corresponding error dynamical system is also obtained. It is shown that the time variation of this Hamilton function along trajectories can play the role of the time variation of the Lyapunov function - in determining the asymptotic stability of the synchronization manifold. Numerical computations indicate that as the synaptic strengths and the magnetic gain parameters change, the time variation of the Hamilton function is always non-zero (i.e., a relatively large positive or negative value) only when the time variation of the Lyapunov function is positive, and zero (or vanishingly small) only when the time variation of the Lyapunov function is also zero. This clearly therefore paves an alternative way to determine the asymptotic stability of synchronization manifolds, and can be particularly useful for systems whose Lyapunov function is difficult to construct, but whose Hamilton function corresponding to the dynamic error system is easier to calculate.",20,[],9

2007.16080,nlin,"Computational modeling of pattern formation in nonequilibrium systems is a fundamental tool for studying complex phenomena in biology, chemistry, materials science and engineering. The pursuit for theoretical descriptions of some among those physical problems led to the Swift-Hohenberg equation (SH3) which describes pattern selection in the vicinity of instabilities. A finite differences scheme, known as Stabilizing Correction (Christov & Pontes; 2001 DOI: 10.1016/S0895-7177(01)00151-0), developed to integrate the cubic Swift-Hohenberg equation in two dimensions, is reviewed and extended in the present paper. The original scheme features Generalized Dirichlet boundary conditions (GDBC), forcings with a spatial ramp of the control parameter, strict implementation of the associated Lyapunov functional, and second order representation of all derivatives. We now extend these results by including periodic boundary conditions (PBC), forcings with gaussian distributions of the control parameter and the quintic Swift-Hohenberg (SH35) model. The present scheme also features a strict implementation of the functional for all test cases. A code verification was accomplished, showing unconditional stability, along with second order accuracy in both time and space. Test cases confirmed the monotonic decay of the Lyapunov functional and all numerical experiments exhibit the main physical features: highly nonlinear behaviour, wavelength filter and competition between bulk and boundary effects.",20,[],9
2006.07277,nlin,"The active Phase-Field-Crystal (aPFC) model combines elements of the Toner-Tu theory for self-propelled particles and the classical Phase-Field-Crystal (PFC) model that describes the transition between liquid to crystalline phases. In the liquid-crystal coexistence region of the PFC model, crystalline clusters exist in the form of localized states that coexist with the homogeneous background. At sufficiently strong self-propulsion strength (or activity) they start to travel. We employ numerical path continuation and direct time simulations to first investigate the existence regions of different types of localized states for a one-dimensional system. The results are summarized in morphological phase diagrams in the parameter plane spanned by activity and mean concentration. Then we focus on the interaction of traveling localized states studying their collision behavior. As a result we distinguish 'elastic' and 'inelastic' collisions. In the former, localized states recover their properties after a collision while in the latter they may annihilate or form resting or traveling bound states. In passing, we describe oscillating and modulated traveling localized states that have as the steadily traveling localized states no counterpart in the classical PFC model.",20,[],9

The chimera states manifest themselves as a mismatch of average frequency between two synchronous and one desynchronized oscillator. We find this kind of striking chimeric behavior is robust in a wide parameter region.

Then, via an improved asymptotic analysis method relying on the balance between different algebraic terms, we derive the explicit expressions of all asymptotic solitons of the rational solutions with the order 1<=N<=4. It turns out that the asymptotic solitons are localized in the straight or algebraic curves, and the exact solutions approach the curved asymptotic solitons with a slower rate than the straight ones. Moreover, we find that all the rational solutions exhibit just five different types of soliton interactions, and the interacting solitons are divided into two halves with each having the same amplitudes. Particularly for the curved asymptotic solitons, there may exist a slight difference for their velocities between at t and -t with certain parametric condition. In addition, we reveal that the soliton interactions in the rational solutions with N>=2 are stronger than those in the exponential and exponential-and-rational solutions.",20,[],9
2010.14976,nlin,"From biology to social science, the functioning of a wide range of systems is the result of elementary interactions which involve more than two constituents, so that their description has unavoidably to go beyond simple pairwise-relationships. Simplicial complexes are therefore the mathematical objects providing a faithful representation of such systems. We here present a complete theory of synchronization of equation-dimensional oscillators obeying an extended Kuramoto model, and interacting by means of 1- and 2- simplices. Not only our theory fully describes and unveils the intimate reasons and mechanisms for what was observed so far with pairwise interactions, but it also offers predictions for a series of rich and novel behaviors in simplicial structures, which include: a) a discontinuous de-synchronization transition at positive values of the coupling strength for all dimensions, b) an extra discontinuous transition at zero coupling for all odd dimensions, and c) the occurrence of partially synchronized states at equation (and all odd equation) even for negative values of the coupling strength, a feature which is inherently prohibited with pairwise-interactions. Furthermore, our theory untangles several aspects of the emergent behavior: the system can never fully synchronize from disorder, and is characterized by an extreme multi-stability, in that the asymptotic stationary synchronized states depend always on the initial conditions. All our theoretical predictions are fully corroborated by extensive numerical simulations. Our results elucidate the dramatic and novel effects that higher-order interactions may induce in the collective dynamics of ensembles of coupled equation-dimensional oscillators, and can therefore be of value and interest for the understanding of many phenomena observed in nature, like for instance the swarming and/or flocking processes unfolding in three or more dimensions.",20,[],9
2007.02894,nlin,"Game of Life is a simple and elegant model to study dynamical system over networks. The model consists of a graph where every vertex has one of two types, namely, dead or alive. A configuration is a mapping of the vertices to the types. An update rule describes how the type of a vertex is updated given the types of its neighbors. In every round, all vertices are updated synchronously, which leads to a configuration update. While in general, Game of Life allows a broad range of update rules, we focus on two simple families of update rules, namely, underpopulation and overpopulation, that model several interesting dynamics studied in the literature. In both settings, a dead vertex requires at least a desired number of live neighbors to become alive. For underpopulation (resp., overpopulation), a live vertex requires at least (resp. at most) a desired number of live neighbors to remain alive. We study the basic computation problems, e.g., configuration reachability, for these two families of rules. For underpopulation rules, we show that these problems can be solved in polynomial time, whereas for overpopulation rules they are PSPACE-complete.",20,[],9

The chaotic dynamics is studied using escape time plots and by computations of the 2D invariant manifolds associated with the complex unstable fixed point.

The determinant expressions of soliton, breather, rational, and semi-rational solutions of the (4  1)-dimensional Fokas equation are constructed based on the Hirota's bilinear method and the KP hierarchy reduction method. The complex dynamics of these new exact solutions are shown in both three-dimensional plots and two-dimensional contour plots. Interestingly, the patterns of obtained high-order lumps are similar to those of rogue waves in the (1  1)-dimensions by choosing different values of the free parameters of the model. Furthermore, three kinds of new semi-rational solutions are presented and the classification of lump fission and fusion processes is also discussed. Additionally, we give a new way to obtain rational and semi-rational solutions of (3  1)-dimensional KP equation by reducing the solutions of the (4  1)-dimensional Fokas equation. All these results show that the (4  1)-dimensional Fokas equation is a meaningful multidimensional extension of the KP and DS equations.

It is possible to decouple the representation into two pairs of operators which are used to construct a periodic table of ECA that maps all unique rules in such a way that rules having similar behavior are clustered together. Finally, the operator representation is used to implement a generalized logistic extension to ECA. Here a single tuning parameter scales the pace with which operators iterate the rules.

2005.10847,nlin,"General rogue waves in (11)-dimensional three-wave resonant interaction systems are derived by the bilinear method. These solutions are divided into three families, which correspond to a simple root, two simple roots and a double root of a certain quartic equation arising from the dimension reduction respectively. It is shown that while the first family of solutions associated with a simple root exist for all signs of the nonlinear coefficients in the three-wave interaction equations, the other two families of solutions associated with two simple roots and a double root can only exist in the so-called soliton-exchange case, where the nonlinear coefficients have certain signs. Many of these rogue wave solutions, such as those associated with two simple roots, and higher-order solutions associated with a simple root, are new solutions which have not been reported before. Technically, our bilinear derivation of rogue waves for the double-root case is achieved by a generalization to the previous dimension reduction procedure in the bilinear method, and this generalized procedure allows us to treat roots of arbitrary multiplicities. Dynamics of the derived rogue waves is also examined, and new rogue-wave patterns are presented. Connection between these bilinear rogue waves and those derived earlier by Darboux transformation is also explained.",20,[],9
2010.13142,nlin,"We examine the role of strong nonlinearity on the topologically-robust edge state in a one-dimensional system. We consider a chain inspired from the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, but with a finite-frequency edge state and the dynamics governed by second-order differential equations. We introduce a cubic onsite-nonlinearity and study this nonlinear effect on the edge state's frequency and linear stability. Nonlinear continuation reveals that the edge state loses its typical shape enforced by the chiral symmetry and becomes generally unstable due to various types of instabilities that we analyze using a combination of spectral stability and Krein signature analysis. This results in an initially-excited nonlinear-edge state shedding its energy into the bulk over a long time. However, the stability trends differ both qualitatively and quantitatively when softening and stiffening types of nonlinearity are considered. In the latter, we find a frequency regime where nonlinear edge states can be linearly stable. This enables high-amplitude edge states to remain spatially localized without shedding their energy, a feature that we have confirmed via long-time dynamical simulations. Finally, we examine the robustness of frequency and stability of nonlinear edge states against disorder, and find that those are more robust under a chiral disorder compared to a non-chiral disorder. Moreover, the frequency-regime where high-amplitude edge states were found to be linearly stable remains intact in the presence of small amount of disorder of both types.",20,[],9
2007.00941,nlin,"One of the fundamental tasks in the study of dynamical systems is the discrimination between regular and chaotic behavior. Over the years several methods of chaos detection have been developed. Some of them, such as the construction of the system's Poincar\'e Surface of Section, are appropriate for low-dimensional systems. However, an enormous number of real-world problems are described by high-dimensional systems. Thus, modern numerical methods like the Smaller (SALI) and the Generalized (GALI) Alignment Index, which can also be used for lower-dimensional systems, are appropriate for investigating regular and chaotic motion in high-dimensional systems. In this work, we numerically investigate the behavior of the GALIs in the neighborhood of simple stable periodic orbits of the well-known Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou lattice model. In particular, we study how the values of the GALIs depend on the width of the stability island and the system's energy. We find that the asymptotic GALI values increase when the studied regular orbits move closer to the edge of the stability island for fixed energy, while these indices decrease as the system's energy increases. We also investigate the dependence of the GALIs on the initial distribution of the coordinates of the deviation vectors used for their computation and the corresponding angles between these vectors. In this case, we show that the final constant values of the GALIs are independent of the choice of the initial deviation vectors needed for their computation.",20,[],9

2008.07509,nlin,"The two paradigmatic nonlinear oscillatory models with parametric excitation are studied. The authors provide theoretical evidence for the appearance of extreme events (EEs) in those systems.

The authors also calculate the return time of two successive EEs, defined as inter-event intervals, that follow Poisson-like distribution, confirm the rarity of the events. Further, the total energy of the Lienard oscillator is estimated to explain the mechanism for the development of EEs. Next, the authors confirmed the emergence of EEs in a parametrically excited microelectromechanical system. In this model, EEs occur due to the appearance of stick-slip bifurcation near the discontinuous boundary of the system. Since the parametric excitation is encountered in several real-world engineering models, like macro and micromechanical oscillators, the implications of the results presented in this paper are perhaps beneficial to understand the development of EEs in such oscillatory systems.",20,[],9

2003.00340,nlin,"Stationary periodic patterns are widespread in natural sciences, ranging from nano-scale electrochemical and amphiphilic systems to mesoscale fluid, chemical and biological media and to macro-scale vegetation and cloud patterns. Their formation is usually due to a primary symmetry breaking of a uniform state to stripes, often followed by secondary instabilities to form zigzag and labyrinthine patterns. These secondary instabilities are well studied under idealized conditions of an infinite domain, however, on finite domains, the situation is more subtle since the unstable modes depend also on boundary conditions. Using two prototypical models, the Swift-Hohenberg equation and the forced complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, we consider bounded domains with no flux boundary conditions transversal to the stripes, and reveal a distinct mixed-mode instability that lies in between the classical zigzag and the Eckhaus lines. This explains the stability of stripes in the mildly zigzag unstable regime, and, after crossing the mixed-mode line, the evolution of zigzag stripes in the bulk of the domain and the formation of defects near the boundaries.

The dominant low energy potential curve for each system, computed here using widely accepted nucleon-nucleon interactions with and without the inclusion of a three-nucleon force, shows no sign of a low energy resonance. However, both systems exhibit a low energy enhancement of the density of states, or of the Wigner-Smith time-delay, which derives from long-range universal physics analogous to the Efimov effect.

2004.05877,nucl-th,"An approach for a Poincar\'e covariant description of nuclear structure and of lepton scattering off nuclei is proposed within the relativistic Hamiltonian dynamics in the light-front form. Indeed a high level of accuracy is needed for a comparison with the increasingly precise present and future experimental data at high momentum transfer. Therefore, to distinguish genuine QCD effects or effects of medium modified nucleon structure functions from conventional nuclear structure effects, the commutation rules between the Poincar\'e generators should be satisfied. For the first time in this paper a proper hadronic tensor for inclusive deep inelastic scattering of electrons off nuclei is derived in the impulse approximation in terms of the single nucleon hadronic tensor. Our approach is based : i) on a light-front spectral function for nuclei, obtained taking advantage of the successful non-relativistic knowledge of nuclear interaction, and ii) on the free current operator that, if defined in the Breit reference frame with the momentum transfer, equation, parallel to the equation axis, fulfills Poincar\'e covariance and current conservation.   Our results can be generalized : i) to exclusive processes or to semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering processes; ii) to the case where the final state interaction is considered through a Glauber approximation; iii) to finite momentum transfer kinematics.   As a first test, the hadronic tensor is applied to obtain the nuclear structure function Fequation and to evaluate the EMC effect for equation in the Bjorken limit.

A structure model of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) is applied to calculate the ground and excited states of equationMg and equationBe. The calculation describes the isoscalar feature of the ground-band equation(equation) excitation and predicts the neutron dominance of the side-band equation(equation) excitation in equationMg and equationBe. The equation and equation inelastic scattering off equationMg and equationBe is calculated by microscopic coupled-channel (MCC) calculations with a equation-matrix folding approach by using the matter and transition densities of the target nuclei calculated with AMD.

The effects of bulk viscosity and an initial pre-equilibrium stage on the results are quantified. We find that equation is strongly correlated with the initial state entropy per elliptic area, equation. Using this result, we explain how the observed correlations between the elliptic flow and the transverse momentum (both in simulations and experiment) reflect the initial state correlations between equation and ellipticity equation at fixed multiplicity.

The diverse effects of variation in equation mass on their formation and the equation of state (EoS) are studied in this work with an effective chiral model and the resultant NS properties are calculated with the help of parameterized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations (PTOV) to bring out the two important features of pressure in the context of massive NSs. The equation puzzle is re-explored and resolved taking into account the concept of modified/parameterized inertial pressure and self-gravity in case of massive pulsars like PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0348-0432. It is seen that although the presence of exotic matter like the hyperons and the equations softens the EoS considerably, their presence in massive NSs can be successfully explained with the theory of parameterized hydrostatic equilibrium conditions.

The Lund string fragmentation parameters determine the yields and transverse momentum (equation) spectra of particles produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions. The values of Lund string fragmentation parameters were determined by fitting the charged particle yield and equation spectra measured in the experiment. In this paper, we have shown the yield of strange quarks carrying hadrons, e.g. equation mesons, are more sensitive to Lund string fragmentation parameters compared to non-strange pions. Using equation meson spectra measured at RHIC, we have obtained new sets of Lund parameters for AuAu collisions at equation = 11.5, 39, and 200 GeV. We have found that using the same set of parameters, we can explain equation-meson yield at equation = 39 and 200 GeV, however, we need a different set of parameters for equation = 11.5 GeV.

In the ideal magnetohydrodynamics limit, the linear dispersion relation yields the well-known propagating modes: the Alfv\'en and the magneto-sonic modes.In the presence of bulk viscous pressure, the causality bound is found to be independent of the magnitude of the magnetic field. The same bound also remains true, when we take the full non-linear form of the equation using the method of characteristics. In the presence of shear viscous pressure, the causality bound is independent of the magnitude of the magnetic field for the two magneto-sonic modes. The causality bound for the shear-Alfv\'en modes, however, depends both on the magnitude and the direction of the propagation. For modified IS theory in the presence of shear viscosity, new non-hydrodynamic modes emerge but the asymptotic causality condition is the same as that of IS.

It has been shown that the ERF method does not work for large-charge colliding nuclei. Moreover, even for lower charges it is not clear that the results of the ERF method are accurately enough.

For equation inelastic scattering to the equation state, the calculated result was in reasonable agreement with the equation data at equation and 40.9 MeV/A and supported the AMD prediction of the neutron transition matrix element equation fmequation. For the equation inelastic scattering to equation, the MCCAMD calculation overshot the equation cross sections at equation MeV/A by a factor of three. According to a phenomenological model analysis, equation values in the range of 4--6 fmequation were favored to reproduce the equation cross sections of the equation reaction at equation MeV/A. For the equation reaction, the MCCAMD calculation reproduced the elastic cross sections at equation MeV/A. Theoretical predictions of the (equation) and (equation) cross sections to the equation, equation, equation and equation states are also given.",20,[],11

The found similarity of these equations of state allows us to show that within the present approach the high density phase of Bose-Einstein particles is a classical macro-cluster with vanishing entropy at any temperature which, similarly to the classical hard spheres, is a kind of solid state.

2002.00562,nucl-th,"The radii and tidal deformabilities of neutron stars are investigated in the framework of relativistic mean-field (RMF) model with different density-dependent behaviors of symmetry energy. To study the effects of symmetry energy on the properties of neutron stars, an equation meson and equation meson coupling term is included in a popular RMF Lagrangian, i.e. the TM1 parameter set, which is used for the widely used supernova equation of state (EoS) table. The coupling constants relevant to the vector-isovector meson, equation, are refitted by a fixed symmetry energy at subsaturation density and its slope at saturation density, while other coupling constants remain the same as the original ones in TM1 so as to update the supernova EoS table. The radius and mass of maximum neutron stars are not so sensitive to the symmetry energy in these family TM1 parameterizations. However, the radii at intermediate mass region are strongly correlated with the slope of symmetry energy. Furthermore, the dimensionless tidal deformabilities of neutron stars are also calculated within the associated Love number. We find that its value at equation has a linear correlation to the slope of symmetry energy being different from the previous studied. With the latest constraints of tidal deformabilities from GW170817 event, the slope of symmetry energy at nuclear saturation density should be smaller than equation MeV in the family TM1 parameterizations. This fact supports the usage of lower symmetry energy slope for the update supernova EoS, which is applicable to simulations of neutron star merger. Furthermore, the analogous analysis are also done within the family IUFSU parameter sets. It is found that the correlations between the symmetry energy slope with the radius and tidal deformability at equation have very similar linear relations in these RMF models.",20,[],11

Global surveys of ground-state octupole deformation, performed with a limited number of models, suggest that the number of pear-shaped isotopes is fairly limited across the nuclear landscape. We carry out global analysis of ground-state octupole deformations for particle-bound even-even nuclei with equation and equation using nuclear density functional theory (DFT) with several non-relativistic and covariant energy density functionals. In this way, we can identify the best candidates for reflection-asymmetric shapes.

We consider five Skyrme and four covariant energy density functionals. We predict several regions of ground-state octupole deformation. In addition to the ""traditional"" regions of neutron-deficient actinide nuclei around equationRa and neutron-rich lanthanides around equationBa, we identified vast regions of reflecion-asymmetric shapes in very neutron-rich nuclei around equationGd and equationPu, as well as in several nuclei around equationBa.

High-energy antiproton-nucleus reactions are reasonably described by the Glauber model with a minimal profile function that reproduces the equation and equation-equationC cross section data. In contrast to the proton-nucleus scattering, we find that the complete absorption occurs even beyond the nuclear radius due to the large equation elementary cross sections, which shows stronger sensitivity to the nuclear density distribution in the tail region.

Solutions of instanton-like equations without pairing and actions they produce are studied for the Woods-Saxon potential along realistic fission trajectories. Actions for unpaired particles are combined with cranking actions for even-even cores and fission hindrance for odd-A nuclei is studied in such a hybrid model.

The plasma effects on the change of nuclear energy levels are probed through computations performed within the nuclear shell-model framework. For this purpose, the single-particle energy (spe) values to be used in the calculations are obtained by considering the modified Woods-Saxon (WS) potential due to shielding effect of plasma environment.

Therefore, studying the damage mechanics of this kind of devices is fundamental to understand and accurately describe their thermomechanical behavior, so that seismically isolated structures can be designed more safely.   Traditionally, up to this point, damage mechanics of LRB has been modeled using Newtonian mechanics and empirical curve fitting degradation functions. The reason for using empirical degradation polynomials is the fact that Newtonian mechanics lacks the capacity to account for degradation of a system. In this paper, the Unified Mechanics Theory, which integrates laws of Thermodynamics and Newtonian mechanics, is used to model stress-strain response of LRB. When Unified Mechanics Theory is applied, there is no need for curve fitting techniques to describe the degradation behavior of the material. Degradation at every point is calculated using the physics based fundamental equations of the material along the Thermodynamics State Index (TSI) axis.

These methods differ by the choice of z-axis and by the assumption of a prolate or oblate rotor shape of the molecule. For each case, block-structure of the rotational-vibrational Hamiltonian matrix is derived and analyzed, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method are made explicit. This theory is then employed to compute ro-vibrational spectra of singly substituted ozone; roughly, 600 vibrational states of 16O18O16O and 16O16O18O isomers combined, with rotational excitations up to J=5 and both inversion parities (21600 coupled ro-vibrational states total). Splittings between the states of different parities, so called K-doublings, are calculated and analyzed. The roles of the asymmetric-top rotor term and the Coriolis coupling term are determined individually, and it is found that they both affect these splittings, but in the opposite directions. Thus, the two effects partially cancel out, and the residual splittings are relatively small. Energies of the ro-vibrational states reported in this work for 16O18O16O and 16O16O18O are in excellent agreement with literature (available for low vibrational excitation). New data obtained here for the highly excited vibrational states enable the first systematic study of the Coriolis effect in symmetric and asymmetric isotopomers of ozone.",20,[],5
2010.04722,physics,"The paper presents an analysis of the dynamic behaviour of discrete flexural systems composed of Euler--Bernoulli beams. The canonical object of study is the discrete Green's function, from which information regarding the dynamic response of the lattice under point loading by forces and moments can be obtained. Special attention is devoted to the interaction between flexural and torsional waves in a square lattice of Euler--Bernoulli beams, which is shown to yield a range of novel effects, including extreme dynamic anisotropy, non-reciprocity, wave-guiding, filtering, and the ability to create localised defect modes, all without the need for additional resonant elements or interfaces. The analytical study is complimented by numerical computations and finite element simulations, both of which are used to illustrate the effects predicted. A general algorithm is provided for constructing Green's functions as well as defect modes. This algorithm allows the tuning of the lattice to produce pass bands, band gaps, resonant modes, wave-guides, and defect modes, over any desired frequency range.",20,[],5
2002.09768,physics,"We show that when a drop of water is maintained in its Leidenfrost regime, a sound in the form of periodic beats emits from the drop. The process of beat emission involves two distinct frequencies. One component is the frequency of beats itself and second is the frequency of sound in every beat which is emitted when one oscillation in the drop occurs. Experiments have been performed by placing a drop of water over a concave metallic surface and the beats of the drop were recorded by fixing a microphone above the drop. A video camera was also fixed above the drop to record its oscillations. Simple analytical techniques like Fourier and wavelet transforms of the audio signals and image processing of the videos of the drop have been used to gain insight about mechanism of beat emission process. This analysis also helped us in studying the dependence of frequencies, if any, on the radius of the drop and the substrate temperature.",20,[],5
2004.05440,physics,"The dynamics of transitional flows are governed by an interplay between the non-normal linear dynamics and quadratic nonlinearity in the Navier-Stokes equations. In this work, we propose a framework for nonlinear stability analysis that exploits the fact that nonlinear flow interactions are constrained by the physics encoded in the nonlinearity. In particular, we show that nonlinear stability analysis problems can be posed as convex optimization problems based on Lyapunov matrix inequalities and a set of quadratic constraints that represent the nonlinear flow physics. The proposed framework can be used to conduct global and local stability analysis as well as transient energy growth analysis. The approach is demonstrated on the low-dimensional Waleffe-Kim-Hamilton model of transition and sustained turbulence. Our analysis correctly determines the critical Reynolds number for global instability. We further show that the lossless (energy conservation) property of the nonlinearity is destabilizing and serves to increase transient energy growth. Finally, we show that careful analysis of the multipliers used to enforce the quadratic constraints can be used to extract dominant nonlinear flow interactions that drive the dynamics and associated instabilities.",20,[],5
2007.03559,physics,"We report for the first time the theory of optical tweezers of spherical dielectric particles embedded in a chiral medium. We develop a partial-wave (Mie) expansion to calculate the optical force acting on a dielectric microsphere illuminated by a circularly-polarized, highly focused laser beam. When choosing a polarization with the same handedness of the medium, the axial trap stability is improved, thus allowing for tweezing of high-refractive-index particles. When the particle is displaced off-axis by an external force, its equilibrium position is rotated around the optical axis by the mechanical effect of an optical torque. Both the optical torque and the angle of rotation are greatly enhanced in the presence of a chiral host medium when considering radii a few times larger than the wavelength. In this range, the angle of rotation depends strongly on the microsphere radius and the chirality parameter of the host medium, opening the way for a quantitative characterization of both parameters. Measurable angles are predicted even in the case of naturally occurring chiral solutes, allowing for a novel all-optical method to locally probe the chiral response at the nanoscale.",20,[],5
2003.12845,physics,"Rectilinear crawling locomotion is a primitive and common mode of locomotion in slender, soft-bodied animals. It requires coordinated contractions that propagate along a body that interacts frictionally with its environment. We propose a simple approach to understand how these coordinations arise in a neuromechanical model of a segmented, soft-bodied crawler via an iterative process that might have both biological antecedents and technological relevance. Using a simple reinforcement learning algorithm, we show that an initial all-to-all neural coupling converges to a simple nearest-neighbor neural wiring that allows the crawler to move forward using a localized wave of contraction that is qualitatively similar to what is observed in D. melanogaster larvae and used in many biomimetic solutions. The resulting solution is a function of how we weight gait regularization in the reward, with a tradeoff between speed and robustness to proprioceptive noise. Overall, our results, which embed the brain-body-environment triad in a learning scheme, has relevance for soft robotics while shedding light on the evolution and development of locomotion.",20,[],5
2010.16294,physics,"Advances in topological photonics and non-Hermitian optics have drastically changed our perception on how interdisciplinary concepts may empower unprecedented applications. Bridging the two areas could uncover the reciprocity between topology and non-Hermiticity in complex systems. So far, such endeavors have focused mainly on linear-optics regime. Here, we establish a nonlinear non-Hermitian topological platform for control of parity-time (PT) symmetry and topological edge states. Experimentally, we demonstrate that optical nonlinearity effectively modulates the gain and loss of a topological interface waveguide in a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice, leading to switching between PT and non-PT-symmetric regimes accompanied by destruction and restoration of topological zero modes. Theoretically, we examine the fundamental issue of the interplay between two antagonistic effects: the sensitivity close to exceptional points and the robustness of non-Hermitian topological modes. Realizing single-channel control of global PT-symmetry via local nonlinearity may herald new possibilities for light manipulation and unconventional device applications.",20,[],5
2004.06397,physics,"The question whether or not the presence of warm hydrometeors in clouds may play a significant role in the nucleation of new ice particles has been debated for several decades. While the early works of Fukuta and Lee (1986) and Baker (1991) indicated that it might be irrelevant, the more recent study of Prabhakaran et al. (2019) [arXiv:1906.06129] suggested otherwise. In this work, we are aiming to quantify the ice-nucleating potential using high-fidelity flow simulation techniques around a single hydrometeor and use favorable considerations to upscale the effects to a collective of ice particles in clouds. While we find that ice nucleation may be enhanced in the vicinity of a warm hydrometeor by several orders of magnitude and that the affected volume of air is much larger than previously estimated, it is very unlikely that this effect alone causes the rapid enhancement of ice nucleation observed in some types of clouds, mainly due to the low initial volumetric ice concentration. Nonetheless, it is suggested to implement this effect into existing cloud models in order to investigate second-order effects such as ice nucleus preactivation or enhancement after the onset of glaciation.",20,[],5
2001.05750,physics,"We derive a sufficient condition for the linear stability of plasma equilibria with incompressible flow parallel to the magnetic field, equation, constant mass density and anisotropic pressure such that the quantity equation, where equation (equation) is the pressure tensor element parallel (perpendicular) to equation, remains constant. This condition is applicable to any steady state without geometrical restriction. The condition, generalising the respective condition for MHD equilibria with isotropic pressure and constant density derived in Throumoulopoulos & Tasso (2007), involves physically interpretable terms related to the magnetic shear, the flow shear and the variation of total pressure perpendicular to the magnetic surfaces. On the basis of this condition we prove that if a given equilibrium is linearly stable, then the ones resulting from the application of Bogoyavlenskij symmetry transformations are linearly stable too, provided that a parameter involved in those transformations is positive. In addition, we examine the impact of pressure anisotropy, flow, and torsion of a helical magnetic axis, for a specific class of analytic equilibria. In this case we find that the pressure anisotropy and the flow may have either stabilising or destabilising effects. Also, helical configurations with small torsion and large pitch seem to have more favorable stability properties.",20,[],5

When generating a frequency comb via second-harmonic generation, the threshold for the onset of cascaded second-order processes leading to a comb is found to be approximately 85 equationW. The second-harmonic generation efficiency up to this value is in excellent agreement with a previously known theoretical framework. This framework is extended here, showing that the onset of cascaded equation processes and the maximum of the second-harmonic generation efficiency coincide. Furthermore, we observe that the frequency distance between the comb lines is a function of the pump power. It changes from 4 free spectral ranges at the oscillation threshold to 1 free spectral range at 590 equationW.",20,[],5
2009.04352,physics,"In the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), the widely utilized wall boundary is the bounce-back (BB) boundary, which corresponds to the no-slip boundary. The BB boundary prevents the LBM from capturing the accurate shear drag on the wall when addressing high Reynolds number flows using coarse-grid systems. In this study, we proposed a ""wall-function bounce (WFB)"" boundary that incorporates a wall function into the LBM's boundary condition and overcomes the limitation of the BB. The WFB boundary calculates the appropriate shear drag on the wall using a wall function model, and thereafter modifies distribution functions to reflect the shear drag. The Spalding's law was utilized as the wall function in WFB. Simulations of turbulent channel flow at equation=640 and 2003 using the LBM-based large-eddy simulation (LBM-LES) were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed boundary condition. The results indicate that the BB boundary underestimated the time-averaged velocity in the buffer layer at equation=640, and the averaged velocity in the entire domain at equation=2003, when using coarse-grid systems. However, WFB obtained the proper shear drag on the wall and thus, compensated for the underestimation and agreed better with the experimental or DNS data, especially at the first-layer grid. In addition, WFB improved the Reynolds normal stress in the near-wall region to some extent. The distributions of shear stress on the wall by WFB was analogous to those by the wall model function in the finite volume method.",20,[],5
2006.08440,physics,"The International Height Reference System (IHRS) adopted by the IAG in 2015 contains two novelties. First, the mean-tide system is adopted for handling the permanent tide. Second, the reference level of height system is defined by the equipotential surface where the geopotential has a conventional value W0=62636853.4 m2s-2. This value was first determined empirically to provide a good approximation to the global mean sea level and then adopted as a reference value by convention. I analyse the tidal aspects of the reference level based on W0. The W0 is by definition independent of the tidal system adopted for the equipotential surface, but for different tidal systems, different functions are involved in the W of the equation W=W0. I find that the empirical determination of the adopted estimate W0 is inconsistent from the viewpoint of tidal systems. However, the adopted estimate and the consistent estimate from the same data round off to the same value. I propose a simplified definition of IHRF geopotential numbers that would make it possible to transform between IHRF and zero-tide geopotential numbers using a simple datum-difference surface. IHRF should adopt a conventional (best) estimate of the permanent tidal potential such as is contained in the IERS Conventions and use it as a basis for other conventional formulas. The tide-free coordinates of the ITRF, and tide-free Global Geopotential Models are central in the modelling of geopotential for the purposes of the IHRF. I present a set of correction formulas that can be used to move to the zero-tide model before, in the middle, or after the processing, and finally to the mean-tide IHRF. To reduce the confusion around the multitude of tidal systems I propose that modelling should primarily done in the zero-tide system, with the mean-tide potential as an add-on.",20,[],5

2006.13568,physics,"Hyperthermia has been in use for many years; as a potential alternative modality for cancer treatment. In this paper, an experimental investigation of microwave assisted thermal heating (MWATH) of tissue phantom using a domestic microwave oven has been reported. Computer simulations using finite element method based tools was also carried out to support the experimental observations and probe insight on the thermal transport aspects deep within the tissue phantom. A good agreement between predicted and measured temperature were achieved. Furthermore, experiments were conducted to investigate the efficacy of dielectric nanoparticles viz. alumina (Al2O3) and titanium oxide (TiO2) during the MWATH of nanoparticle infused tumor phantoms.

Rates and product branching fractions were determined as a function of temperature. The reaction proceeded with a rate of equation Kequation cmequation sequation. MgOHequation was the dominant product at all temperatures, but Mgequation, the co-product of oxygen-atom transfer to form methanol, was observed with a product branching fraction of equation Kequation. Reactive molecular dynamics simulations using a reactive force field, as well as a neural network yield rate coefficients about one order of magnitude lower. This underestimation of the rates is traced back to the multireference character of the transition state [MgOCHequation]equation. Statistical modeling of the temperature-dependent kinetics provides further insight into the reactive potential surface. The rate limiting step was found to be consistent with a four-centered activation of the C-H bond, consistent with previous calculations. The product branching was modeled as a competition between dissociation of an insertion intermediate directly after the rate-limiting transition state, and traversing a transition state corresponding to a methyl migration leading to a Mg-CHequationOHequation complex, though only if this transition state is stabilized significantly relative to the dissociated MgOHequation  CHequation product channel.

2006.14725,physics,"Advection-dominated dynamical systems, characterized by partial differential equations, are found in applications ranging from weather forecasting to engineering design where accuracy and robustness are crucial. There has been significant interest in the use of techniques borrowed from machine learning to reduce the computational expense and/or improve the accuracy of predictions for these systems. These rely on the identification of a basis that reduces the dimensionality of the problem and the subsequent use of time series and sequential learning methods to forecast the evolution of the reduced state. Often, however, machine-learned predictions after reduced-basis projection are plagued by issues of stability stemming from incomplete capture of multiscale processes as well as due to error growth for long forecast durations. To address these issues, we have developed a \emphnon-autoregressive time series approach for predicting linear reduced-basis time histories of forward models. In particular, we demonstrate that non-autoregressive counterparts of sequential learning methods such as long short-term memory (LSTM) considerably improve the stability of machine-learned reduced-order models. We evaluate our approach on the inviscid shallow water equations and show that a non-autoregressive variant of the standard LSTM approach that is bidirectional in the PCA components obtains the best accuracy for recreating the nonlinear dynamics of partial observations.

2010.10983,physics,"The mean state of the atmosphere and ocean is set through a balance between external forcing (winds, radiation, heat and freshwater fluxes) and the emergent turbulence, which transfers energy to dissipative structures. The forcing gives rise to jets in the atmosphere and currents in the ocean, which spontaneously develop turbulent eddies through the baroclinic instability. A critical step in the development of a theory of climate is to properly include the resulting eddy-induced turbulent transport of properties like heat, moisture, and carbon. The baroclinic instability generates flow structures at the Rossby deformation radius, a length scale of order 1000 km in the atmosphere and 100 km in the ocean, smaller than the planetary scale and the typical extent of ocean basins respectively. There is therefore a separation of scales between the large-scale temperature gradient and the smaller eddies that advect it randomly, inducing effective diffusion. Numerical solutions of the two-layer quasi-geostrophic model, the standard model for studies of eddy motions in the atmosphere and ocean, show that such scale separation remains in the strongly nonlinear turbulent regime, provided there is sufficient bottom drag. We compute the scaling-laws governing the eddy-driven transport associated with baroclinic turbulence. First, we provide a theoretical underpinning for empirical scaling-laws reported in previous studies, for different formulations of the bottom drag law.

2004.13591,physics,"There has been much controversy over weak and strong emergence in physics and biology.

By carefully distinguishing between dfferent types of symmetry breaking and tracing the relation between broken symmetries at micro and macro scales, I demonstrate that the emergence of the properties of semiconductors is a case of strong emergence. This is due to the existence of quasiparticles such as phonons. Furthermore time dependent potentials enable downward causation as in the case of digital computers. Additionally I show that the processes of evolutionary emergence of living systems is also a case of strong emergence, as is the emergence of properties of life out of the underlying physics. A useful result emerges: standard physics theories and the emergent theories arising out of them are all effective theories that are equally valid",20,[],5
2009.03013,physics,"We are interested in solving the Boltzmann equation of chemically reacting rarefied gas flows using the Grad's-14 moment method. We first propose a novel mathematical model that describes the collision dynamics of chemically reacting hard spheres. Using the collision model, we present an algorithm to compute the moments of the Boltzmann collision operator. Our algorithm is general in the sense that it can be used to compute arbitrary order moments of the collision operator and not just the moments included in the Grad's-14 moment system. For a first-order chemical kinetics, we derive reaction rates for a chemical reaction outside of equilibrium thereby, extending the Arrhenius law that is valid only in equilibrium. We show that the derived reaction rates (i) are consistent in the sense that at equilibrium, we recover the Arrhenius law and (ii) have an explicit dependence on the scalar fourteenth moment, highlighting the importance of considering a fourteen moment system rather than a thirteen one. Through numerical experiments we study the relaxation of the Grad's-14 moment system to the equilibrium state.",20,[],5
2011.06696,physics,"For safety purposes, reliable reignition of aircraft engines in the event of flame blow-out is a critical requirement. Typically, an external ignition source in the form of a spark is used to achieve a stable flame in the combustor. However, such forced turbulent ignition may not always successfully relight the combustor, mainly because the state of the combustor cannot be precisely determined. Uncertainty in the turbulent flow inside the combustor, inflow conditions, and spark discharge characteristics can lead to variability in sparking outcomes even for nominally identical operating conditions. Prior studies have shown that of all the uncertain parameters, turbulence is often dominant and can drastically alter ignition behavior. For instance, even when different fuels have similar ignition delay times, their ignition behavior in practical systems can be completely different. In practical operating conditions, it is challenging to understand why ignition fails and how much variation in outcomes can be expected. The focus of this work is to understand relight variability induced by turbulence for two different aircraft fuels, namely Jet-A and a variant named C1. A detailed, previously developed simulation approach is used to generate a large number of successful and failed ignition events. Using this data, the cause of misfire is evaluated based on a discriminant analysis that delineates the difference between turbulent initial conditions that lead to ignition or failure. It was determined that the cause of ignition failure is different for the two fuels. While it was found that Jet-A is influenced by fuel entrainment, C1 was found to be more sensitive to small scale turbulence features. A larger variability is found in the ignition modes of C1, which can be subject to extreme events induced by kernel breakdown.",20,[],5
2001.02922,physics,"Molecular absorption of infrared radiation is generally due to ro-vibrational electric-dipole transitions. Electric-quadrupole transitions may still occur, but they are typically a million times weaker than electric-dipole transitions, rendering their observation extremely challenging. In polyatomic or polar diatomic molecules, ro-vibrational quadrupole transitions have never been observed. Here, we report the first direct detection of quadrupole transitions in water vapor. The detected quadrupole lines have intensity largely above the standard dipole intensity cut-off of spectroscopic databases and thus are important for accurate atmospheric and astronomical remote sensing.",20,[],5
2001.02784,physics,"Electroluminescence (EL) of colloidal nanocrystals promises a new generation of high-performance and solution-processable light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The operation of nanocrystal-based LEDs relies on the recombination of electrically-generated excitons. However, a fundamental question, i.e, how excitons are electrically generated in individual nanocrystals, remains unanswered. Here, we reveal a molecular mechanism of sequential electron-hole injection for the exciton generation in nanocrystal-based EL devices. To decipher the corresponding elementary processes, we develop electrically-pumped single-nanocrystal spectroscopy. While hole injection into neutral quantum dots (QDs) is generally-considered to be inefficient, we find that the intermediate negatively-charged state of QD triggers confinement-enhanced Coulomb interactions, which simultaneously accelerate hole injection and hinder excessive electron injection. In-situ/operando spectroscopy on state-of-the-art QD-LEDs demonstrate that exciton generation at the ensemble level is consistent with the charge-confinement-enabled sequential electron-hole injection mechanism revealed at the single-nanocrystal level. Our findings provide a universal mechanism for enhancing charge balance in nanocrystal-based EL devices.",20,[],5

2001.00433,physics,"When measuring the roughness of rough surfaces, the limited sizes of scanned areas lead to its systematic underestimation. Levelling by polynomials and other filtering used in real-world processing of atomic force microscopy data increases this bias considerably. Here a framework is developed providing explicit expressions for the bias of squared mean square roughness in the case of levelling by fitting a model background function using linear least squares. The framework is then applied to polynomial levelling, for both one-dimensional and two-dimensional data processing, and basic models of surface autocorrelation function, Gaussian and exponential. Several other common scenarios are covered as well, including median levelling, intermediate Gaussian--exponential autocorrelation model and frequency space filtering. Application of the results to other quantities, such as Rq, Sq, Ra and~Sa is discussed. The results are summarized in overview plots covering a range of autocorrelation functions and polynomial degrees, which allow graphical estimation of the bias.",20,[],5
2001.06817,physics,"Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides with different geometries have been employed to design various integrated optical components. Reducing the bending radius of the SOI waveguides with low bending loss is essential in minimizing the footprint of light-wave circuits. The propagating mode is less confined in the core of the ultra-thin SOI waveguide and penetrates to substrate and cladding, leading to higher bending loss compared with conventional SOI waveguide with the thicker guiding layer. While various bending mechanisms have been utilized to reduce the bending loss of conventional SOI waveguides, the ultra-thin SOI waveguide bends have not been studied in detail. In this paper, we present a 60 nm-thick SOI waveguide bend based on the truncated Eaton lens implemented by varying thickness of the guiding layer. The three-dimensional full-wave simulations reveal that the designed waveguide bend, with a radius of 3.9 equation, reduces the bending loss from 3.3 to 0.42 dB at the wavelength of 1550 nm. Moreover, the bending loss for the wavelength range of 1260-1675 nm is lower than 0.67 dB while the bending loss in the C-band is lower than 0.45 dB.",20,[],5
2003.11487,physics,"Chemical imaging based on mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopic contrast is an important technique with a myriad of applications, including biomedical imaging and environmental monitoring. Current MIR cameras, however, lack in performance and are much less affordable compared to mature Si-based devices, which operate in the visible and near-infrared. Here we demonstrate fast MIR chemical imaging through non-degenerate two-photon absorption (NTA) in a standard Si-based charge-coupled device (CCD). We show that wide-field MIR images can be obtained at 100 ms exposure times using picosecond pulse energies of only a few fJ per pixel through NTA directly on the CCD chip. Because this on-chip approach does not rely on phase-matching, it is alignment-free and does not necessitate complex post-processing of the images. We emphasize the utility of this technique through chemically selective MIR imaging of polymers and biological samples, including MIR videos of moving targets, physical processes and live nematodes.",20,[],5
2005.06074,physics,"The propagation and refraction of waves in dispersive media are considered. A primary objective is to determine whether waves refract as monochromatic waves by Snell's law with phase velocity or as wave packets. The refraction of wave packets requires two refraction laws. The wave packets refract according to Snell's law with the geometric group velocity while the wavelets within the wave packets refract according to Snell's law with phase velocity. The tests were performed using directional power spectra from gravity water waves originating in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Indian Ocean, and the Southern Ocean. In all cases the waves were measured with arrays of pressure sensors. It was found that the refraction of monochromatic waves led to backtracks from a measurement site that spread out for the different wave periods and did not go back to a common source. When the refraction was large the results were especially bad. When the data were used to test the refraction of wave packets very good results were obtained. For every storm considered the backtracks of the different wave periods went back together to the wave generation area. These results offer strong support for refracting waves in dispersive media as wave packets, not as monochromatic waves. This result for wave groups was also determined in a controlled wave tank experiment of gravity water waves where a critical angle was tested. The properties of propagating wave packets are also considered and illustrated. Reflection points and critical angles are found and explained. There can be major differences between the propagation of wave packets and monochromatic waves.",20,[],5

Different from traditional bifunctional metasurfaces designed by simple composition of two functionalities, our proposed bifunctional metasurface is based on the interaction between two functionalities. The device shows good potential for the combination of wavefront manipulation and optical absorption, therefore providing a promising approach for switchable detection and anti-detection devices.",20,[],5
2003.08121,physics,"The dynamic of the magnetic structure in a well ordered ferromagnetic CoPd stripe domain pattern has been investigated upon excitation by femtosecond infrared laser pulses. Time-resolved X-ray magnetic circular dichroism in photoemission electron microscopy (TR-XMCD-PEEM) is used to perform real space magnetic imaging with 100 ps time resolution in order to show local transformations of the domains structures. Using the time resolution of the synchrotron radiation facility of the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin, we are able to image the transient magnetic domains in a repetitive pump and probe experiment. In this work, we study the reversible and irreversible transformations of the excited magnetic stripe domains as function of the laser fluence. Our results can be explained by thermal contributions, reducing the XMCD amplitude in each stripe domain below a threshold fluence of 12 mJ/cm2. Above this threshold fluence, irreversible transformations of the magnetic domains are observed. Static XMCD-PEEM images reveal the new partially ordered stripe domain structures characterized by a new local magnetic domain distribution showing an organized pattern at the micrometer scale. This new arrangement is attributed to the recovery of the magnetic anisotropy during heat dissipation under an Oersted field.",20,[],5

2011.06653,physics,"Mid-infrared spectroscopy is essential for chemical identification and compositional analysis, due to the existence of characteristic molecular absorption fingerprints. However, it is very challenging to determine the refractive index of an analyte at low concentrations using current photonic systems in a broad mid-infrared spectral range. We propose an imaging-based nanophotonic technique for refractive index determination. The technique is based on deeply subwavelength graphene plasmon cavities and allows for the retrieval of molecular concentration. This method features a two-dimensional array of suspended graphene plasmon cavities, in which the extremely high field enhancement and extraordinary compression of graphene plasmons can be realized simultaneously by combining shallow and deep cavities. This enables resonant unit cells to be read out in the spatial absorption pattern of the array at multiple spectral points, and the resulting information is then translated into the refractive index of the analytes. The proposed technique gives complementary information compared with the current nanophotonic techniques based on molecular absorption, including the ability of the refractive index measurement, the ultra-broadband measurable spectral range, and the small volume of the analyte required, thereby pushing the potential for refractometric sensing technologies into the infrared frequencies.",20,[],5
2006.00829,physics,"A problem of the erroneous duality gap caused by the presence of symmetries is solved in this paper utilizing point group theory. The optimization problems are first divided into two classes based on their predisposition to suffer from this deficiency. Then, the classical problem of Q-factor minimization is shown in an example where the erroneous duality gap is eliminated by combining solutions from orthogonal sub-spaces. Validity of this treatment is demonstrated in a series of subsequent examples of increasing complexity spanning the wide variety of optimization problems, namely minimum Q-factor, maximum antenna gain, minimum total active reflection coefficient, or maximum radiation efficiency with self-resonant constraint. They involve problems with algebraic and geometric multiplicities of the eigenmodes, and are completed by an example introducing the selective modification of modal currents falling into one of the symmetry-conformal sub-spaces. The entire treatment is accompanied with a discussion of finite numerical precision, and mesh grid imperfections and their influence on the results. Finally, the robust and unified algorithm is proposed and discussed, including advanced topics such as the uniqueness of the optimal solutions, dependence on the number of constraints, or an interpretation of the qualitative difference between the two classes of the optimization problems.",20,[],5
2001.04771,physics,"The advent of ultra short high intensity lasers has paved the way to new and promising, yet challenging, areas of research in the laser-plasma interaction physics. The success of constructing petawatt femtosecond lasers, for instance the Apollon laser in France, will help understanding and designing future particle accelerators and next generation of light sources. Achieving this goal intrinsically relies on the combination between experiments and massively parallel simulations. So far, Particle-In-Cell (PIC) codes have been the ultimate tool to accurately describe the laser-plasma interaction especially in the field of Laser WakeField Acceleration (LWFA) . Nevertheless, the numerical modelling of laser plasma accelerators in 3D can be a very challenging task. This is due to the large dispersity between the scales involved in this process. In order to make such simulations feasible with a significant speed up, we need to use reduced numerical models which simplify the problem while retaining a high fidelity. Among these models, Fourier field decomposition in azimuthal modes for the cylindrical geometry is a promising reduced model especially for physical problems that have close to cylindrical symmetry which is the case in LWFA. This geometry has been implemented in the open-source code Smilei in Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) discretization scheme for the Maxwell solver. In this paper we will study the case of a realistic laser measurement from Apollon facility, the ability of this method to describe it correctly and the determination of the necessary number of modes for this purpose. We will also show the importance of higher modes inclusion in the case of realistic laser profiles to insure fidelity in simulation.",20,[],5
2010.01519,physics,"For the large and chemically diverse GMTKN55 benchmark suite, we have studied the performance of density-corrected density functional theory (HF-DFT), compared to self-consistent DFT, for several pure and hybrid GGA and meta-GGA exchange-correlation (XC) functionals (PBE, BLYP, TPSS, SCAN) as a function of the percentage of HF exchange in the hybrid. The D4 empirical dispersion correction has been added throughout. For subsets dominated by dynamical correlation -- particularly noncovalent interaction subsets -- HF-DFT is highly beneficial, particularly at low HF exchange percentages. For subsets with significant static correlation (i.e., where a Hartree-Fock determinant is not a good zero-order wavefunction), HF-DFT may do more harm than good. While the self-consistent series show optima at or near 37.5% (i.e., 3/8) for all four XC functionals -- consistent with Grimme's proposal of the PBE38 functional -- HF-BnLYP-D4, HF-PBEn-D4, and HF-TPSSn-D4 all exhibit minima nearer 25% (i.e., 1/4). Intriguingly, for HF-SCANn-D4, the minimum is near 10%, but the weighted mean absolute error (WTMAD2) for GMTKN55 is only barely lower than that of HF-SCAN-D4 (i.e., where the post-HF step is a pure meta-GGA). The latter becomes an attractive option, only slightly more costly than pure Hartree-Fock, and devoid of adjustable parameters other than the three in the dispersion correction. Moreover, its WTMAD2 is only surpassed by the highly empirical M06-2X and by the combinatorically optimized empirical range-separated hybrids wB97X-V and wB97M-V.",20,[],5

2004.04539,physics,"Line structures were observed for (110) planar channeling of electrons in a diamond single crystal even at a beam energy of 180 MeV. This observation motivated us to initiate dechanneling length measurements as function of the beam energy since the occupation of quantum states in the channeling potential is expected to enhance the dechanneling length. High energy loss signals, generated as a result of emission of a bremsstrahlung photon with about half the beam energy at channeling of 450 and 855 MeV electrons, were measured as function of the crystal thickness. The analysis required additional assumptions which were extracted from the numerical solution of the Fokker-Planck equation. Preliminary results for diamond are presented. In addition, we reanalyzed dechanneling length measurements at silicon single crystals performed previously at the Mainz Microtron MAMI at beam energies between 195 and 855 MeV from which we conclude that the quality of our experimental data set is not sufficient to derive definite conclusions on the dechanneling length. Our experimental results are below the predictions of the Fokker-Planck equation and somewhat above the results of simulation calculations of A. V. Korol and A. V.

A micro/nanofluidic device was employed for a micro bubble formation, plasma negation and penetration of the plasma through the nanojunction. The direct observation provided a keen evidence of perm-selectivity, i.e. allowing cationic species and rejecting anionic species. Furthermore, we can capture the plasma of Li, which has lower mobility than Na in aqueous state, passed the nanojunction faster than Na due to the absence of hydrated shells around Li.

2010.12258,physics,"Bound states in the continuum (BICs) and Fano resonances in planar photonic lattices, including metasurfaces and photonic crystal slabs, have been studied extensively in recent years. Typically, the BICs and Fano resonances are associated with the second stop bands open at the second-order Gamma (equation) point. This paper address the fundamental properties of the fourth stop band accompanied by BICs at the third-order equation point in one-dimensional (1D) leaky-mode photonic lattices. At the fourth stop band, one band edge mode suffers radiation loss, thereby generating a Fano resonance, while the other band edge mode becomes a nonleaky BIC. The fourth stop band is controlled primarily by the Bragg processes associated with the first, second, and fourth Fourier harmonic components of the periodic dielectric constant modulation. The interplay between these three major processes closes the fourth band gap and induces a band flip whereby the leaky and BIC edges transit across the fourth band gap. At the fourth stop band, a new type of BIC is formed owing to the destructive interplay between the first and second Fourier harmonics. When the fourth band gap closes with strongly enhanced equation factors, Dirac cone dispersions can appear at the third-order equation point. Our results demonstrate a method for manipulating electromagnetic waves by utilizing the high-equation Bloch modes at the fourth stop band.",20,[],5

2002.09776,physics,"Wall-bounded turbulent flows are widely observed in natural and engineering systems, such as air flows near the Earth's surface, water flows in rivers, and flows around a car or a plane. The universal logarithmic velocity profile in wall-bounded turbulent flows proposed by von K\'arm\'an in 1930 is one of the few exact physical descriptions of turbulence. However, the mean velocity and temperature profiles cannot be adequately described by this universal log law when buoyancy effects are present. Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST), proposed in 1954, has been the cornerstone theory to account for these buoyancy effects and to describe the atmospheric boundary layer. MOST has been used in almost all global weather, climate and hydrological models to describe the dependence of the mean velocity, temperature and scalar profiles on buoyancy. According to MOST, the logarithmic temperature profile breaks down as buoyancy effects become important. In contrast, here we show that this long-standing MOST theory does not apply for temperature. We propose a new theory for the logarithmic profile of near-wall temperature, which corrects MOST pitfalls and is supported by both high-resolution direct numerical simulations and field observations of the convective atmospheric boundary layer. Buoyancy effects do not modify the logarithmic nature but instead modulate the slope of the temperature profile compared to the universal von K\'arm\'an slope. The new formulation has widespread applications such as in climate models, where the proposed new temperature log law should lead to more realistic continental surface temperature, which are strongly impacted by buoyancy.",20,[],5
2006.05318,physics,"In this article we examine channel flow subject to spatially varying viscosity in the streamwise direction. The Reynolds number is imposed locally with three different ramps. The setup is reminiscent of transient channel flow, but with a space dependent viscosity rather than a time dependent viscosity. It is also relevant to various applications in nuclear engineering and in particular in test reactors, where the viscosity changes significantly in the streamwise direction, and there is a severe lack of Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data to benchmark turbulence models in these conditions.   As part of this work we set up a novel benchmark case: the channel is extended in the stream-wise direction up to 20p. The viscosity is kept constant in the first 4p region. This inlet region is used as a cyclic region to obtain a fully developed flow profile at the beginning of the ramping region. In the ramping region the Reynolds number is linearly increased along the channel. The flow is homogenous in the spanwise direction, while it is nonhomogenous in the stream-wise and wall-normal direction. We perform here Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) with Nek5000, a spectral-element computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code developed at Argonne National Laboratory.   In this study, specific focus is given to the investigation of turbulence properties and structures in the near-wall region along the flow direction. Turbulent statistics are collected and investigated. Similarly to transient channel flow, the results show that a variation in the Reynolds across a channel does not cause an immediate change in the size of turbulent structures in the ramp region and a delay is in fact observed in both wall shear and friction Reynolds number.

2003.09406,physics,"We present a new ray bending approach, referred to as the Eigenray method, for solving two-point boundary-value kinematic and dynamic ray tracing problems in 3D smooth heterogeneous general anisotropic elastic media. The proposed Eigenray method is aimed to provide reliable stationary ray path solutions and their dynamic characteristics, in cases where convergence to the stationary paths, based on conventional initial-value ray shooting methods, becomes challenging. The kinematic ray tracing solution corresponds to the vanishing first traveltime variation, leading to a stationary path, and is governed by the nonlinear second-order Euler-Lagrange equation (Part I). In Part II we elaborate on theoretical aspects of the proposed method and validate its correctness for general anisotropy. In Part III we use a finite-element approach, applying the weak formulation. In Part IV we propose an efficient method to compute the geometric spreading of the entire stationary ray path using the global traveltime Hessian. In Part V we formulate the dynamic ray tracing, considering the second traveltime variation, which leads to the linear second-order Jacobi equation, and in Part VI we relate the proposed Lagrangian approach to the commonly used Hamiltonian approach. The solution is provided in Part VII, where we implement a similar finite element approach applied for the kinematic problem. In both kinematic and dynamic problems, in between the nodes, the values of the ray characteristics are computed with the Hermite interpolation, which we find most natural for anisotropic media.

We have investigated this interplay, computing virtually-exact spectra of small closed-shell molecules using the adaptive-sampling configuration interaction method (ASCI), unveiling a rich satellite structure reflecting the presence of QP interactions. To complement and interpret these exact spectra and the relevant QP interactions, we employ the perturbative equation and vertex corrected equation approaches. Inclusion of vertex corrections is shown to go beyond equation, capturing multi-QP physics through recovery of the necessary excitonic and induced dynamical exchange interactions.

We show that the mixing between the dipolar excitations and cavity photons into polaritons can lead to the appearance of new states localized at the ends of the dipolar chain, which are reminiscent of Tamm surface states found in electronic systems. A crucial requirement for the formation of polaritonic Tamm states is that the cavity cross-section is above a critical size. Above this threshold, the degree of localization of the Tamm states is highly dependent on the cavity size, since their participation ratio scales linearly with the cavity cross-sectional area. Our findings may be important for quantum confinement effects in one-dimensional systems with strong light-matter coupling.",20,[],5
2011.03446,physics,"Significance: We proposed a new design of hand-held linear-array photoacoustic (PA) probe which can acquire multi images via motor moving. Moreover, images from different locations are utilized via imaging fusion for SNR enhancement. Aim: We devised an adjustable hand-held for the purpose of realizing different images at diverse location for further image fusion. For realizing the light spot which is more matched with the Ultrasonic transducer detection area, we specially design a light adjust unit. Moreover, due to no displacement among the images, there is no need to execute image register process. The program execution time be reduced, greatly. Approach: mechanical design; Montel carol simulation; no-registration image fusion; Spot compression. Results: Multiple PA images with different optical illumination areas were acquired. After image fusion, we obtained fused PA images with higher signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and image fidelity than each single PA image. A quantitative comparison shows that the SNR of fused image is improved by 36.06% in agar-milk phantom, and 44.69% in chicken breast phantom, respectively. Conclusions: In this paper, the light scanning adjustable hand-held PA imaging probe is proposed, which can realize PA imaging with different illumination positions via adjusting the optical unit.",20,[],5

2006.03971,physics,"This work addresses a longstanding theoretical discrepancy using Density Functional Theory (DFT) with experimental observations of CO binding trends on electrocatalytically relevant metals for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). By introducing thermal fluctuations using appropriate statistical mechanical NVT and NPT ensembles, we show that DFT with universal dispersion interactions yields qualitatively better metal surface strain trends and CO binding energetics, consistently predicts the correct site preference for all metals due to thermally induced surface distortions that preferentially exposes the undercoordinated atop site for Cu(111) and Pt(111), and for the weak binding Ag(111) and Au(111) surfaces at finite temperatures shows CO-metal interactions that are a mixture of chemisorbed and physisorbed species.

2006.07348,physics,"We experimentally demonstrate temporal pumping of elastic waves in an electromechanical waveguide. An aluminum beam covered by an array of piezoelectric patches connected to shunt circuits with controllable resistances enables the spatial and temporal control of the beam's stiffness. The spatial modulation produces non-trivial edge states, while a smooth temporal variation of the modulation phase drives the transfer of edge states from one boundary of the waveguide to the other in a controllable manner. This characteristic behavior for a topological pump is here demonstrated for the first time in a continuous elastic waveguide. The framework presented herein opens new avenues for the manipulation and transport of information through elastic waves, with potential technological applications for digital delay lines and digitally controlled waveguides. Our study also explores higher dimensional topological physics using time as a synthetic dimension in electromechanical systems.",20,[],5

2003.00073,q-bio,"Female athletes are severely understudied in the field of concussion research, despite higher prevalence for injuries and tendency to have longer recovery time. Hormonal fluctuations due to normal menstrual cycle (MC) or hormonal contraceptive (HC) use have been shown to impact both post-injury symptoms and neuroimaging measures, but have not been accounted for in concussion studies. In this preliminary study, we compared arterial spin labeling measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) between concussed female club athletes 3-10 days post injury (mTBI) and demographic, HC/MC matched controls (CON). We test whether CBF mediates the relationship between progesterone levels in blood and post-injury symptoms, which may be evidence for progesterone`s role in neuroprotection. We found a significant three-way relationship between progesterone, CBF and perceived stress score (PSS) in the left middle temporal gyrus. Higher progesterone was associated with lower (more normative) PSS, as well as higher (more normative) CBF. CBF mediates 100% of the relationship between progesterone and PSS (Sobel`s p-value=0.017). These findings suggest progesterone may have a neuroprotective role after concussion and highlight the importance of controlling for the effects of sex hormones in future concussion studies.",20,[],10
2005.03214,q-bio,"Given the stochastic nature of gene expression, genetically identical cells exposed to the same environmental inputs will produce different outputs. This heterogeneity has been hypothesized to have consequences for how cells are able to survive in changing environments. Recent work has explored the use of information theory as a framework to understand the accuracy with which cells can ascertain the state of their surroundings. Yet the predictive power of these approaches is limited and has not been rigorously tested using precision measurements. To that end, we generate a minimal model for a simple genetic circuit in which all parameter values for the model come from independently published data sets. We then predict the information processing capacity of the genetic circuit for a suite of biophysical parameters such as protein copy number and protein-DNA affinity. We compare these parameter-free predictions with an experimental determination of protein expression distributions and the resulting information processing capacity of E. coli cells. We find that our minimal model captures the scaling of the cell-to-cell variability in the data and the inferred information processing capacity of our simple genetic circuit up to a systematic deviation.",20,[],10
2010.06357,q-bio,"Antibody therapeutics and vaccines are among our last resort to end the raging COVID-19 pandemic.They, however, are prone to over 1,800 mutations uncovered by a Mutation Tracker. It is urgent to understand how vaccines and antibodies in the development would be impacted by mutations. In this work, we first study the mechanism, frequency, and ratio of mutations on the spike (S) protein, which is the common target of most COVID-19 vaccines and antibody therapies. Additionally, we build a library of antibody structures and analyze their 2D and 3D characteristics. Moreover, we predict the mutation-induced binding free energy (BFE) changes for the complexes of S protein and antibodies or ACE2. By integrating genetics, biophysics, deep learning, and algebraic topology, we deduce that some of the mutations such as M153I, S254F, and S255F may weaken the binding of S protein and antibodies, and potentially disrupt the efficacy and reliability of antibody therapies and vaccines in the development. We provide a strategy to prioritize the selection of mutations for designing vaccines or antibody cocktails.",20,[],10
2001.06948,q-bio,"Humans, domestic animals, orchard crops, and ornamental plants are commonly treated with antibiotics in response to bacterial infection. By curing infectious individuals, antibiotic therapy might limit the spread of contagious disease among hosts. But antibiotic suppression of within-host pathogen density might also reduce the probability that the host is otherwise removed from infectious status before recovery. When rates of both recovery and removal (isolation or mortality) depend directly on within-host density, antibiotic therapy can relax the removal rate and so increase between-host disease transmission. In this paper a deterministic within-host dynamics drives the infectious host's probability of infection transmission, as well as the host's time-dependent probability of surviving to recovery. The model varies (1) inoculum size, (2) the time elapsing between infection and initiation of therapy, (2) antibiotic efficacy, and (3) the size/susceptibility of groups encountered by an infectious host. Results identify conditions where antibiotic treatment simultaneously increases host survival and increases the expected number of new infections. That is, antibiotics might convert a rare, serious bacterial disease into a common, but treatable infection.",20,[],10

Agents attempted to learn to track a hidden fluctuation ""source"", which, linearly mixed with other masking fluctuations, generated observable input vectors. Learning was driven either solely by direct observation of inputs (unsupervised, Hebbian) or, in addition, by observation of another agent's output (supervised, Delta rule). To enhance biological realism, the learning rules were made slightly connection-inspecific, so that incorrect learning sometimes occurs. We found that social interaction can foster both correct and incorrect learning. Useful social learning therefore presumably involves additional factors some of which we outline.",20,[],10

SCOPE is an open-source program that generates proteins from rotamer space.

2008.05377,q-bio,"Currently, the number of patients with COVID-19 has significantly increased. Thus, there is an urgent need for developing treatments for COVID-19. Drug repurposing, which is the process of reusing already-approved drugs for new medical conditions, can be a good way to solve this problem quickly and broadly. Many clinical trials for COVID-19 patients using treatments for other diseases have already been in place or will be performed at clinical sites in the near future. Additionally, patients with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, liver cirrhosis, kidney diseases, hypertension, and asthma are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Thus, the relationship of comorbidity disease with COVID-19 may help to find repurposable drugs. To reduce trial and error in finding treatments for COVID-19, we propose building a network-based drug repurposing framework to prioritize repurposable drugs. First, we utilized knowledge of COVID-19 to construct a disease-gene-drug network (DGDr-Net) representing a COVID-19-centric interactome with components for diseases, genes, and drugs. DGDr-Net consisted of 592 diseases, 26,681 human genes and 2,173 drugs, and medical information for 18 common comorbidities. The DGDr-Net recommended candidate repurposable drugs for COVID-19 through network reinforcement driven scoring algorithms. The scoring algorithms determined the priority of recommendations by utilizing graph-based semi-supervised learning. From the predicted scores, we recommended 30 drugs, including dexamethasone, resveratrol, methotrexate, indomethacin, quercetin, etc., as repurposable drugs for COVID-19, and the results were verified with drugs that have been under clinical trials. The list of drugs via a data-driven computational approach could help reduce trial-and-error in finding treatment for COVID-19.",20,[],10
2011.05294,q-bio,"Attention Schema Theory (AST) is a recent proposal to provide a scientific explanation for the basis of subjective awareness. Essentially, AST posits that conscious experience in the minds of humans and some other animals is the result of evolution having provided the mind with its own internal model of attention taking place within their own (and others') mind (the 'attention schema'). However, the inability of humans to understand how their own subjective awareness arises (related to the so-called 'hard problem' of consciousness) is because the attention schema is inherently incomplete. In this short note, we ask to what extent it is possible, in principle, for a mind (either human or machine-based) to have an attention schema that is complete in the sense of being able to faithfully represent streams of attention. Using a simple model and a mathematical argument based on classical topology, we describe some limits of the extent to which an attention schema could be complete.",20,[],10
2009.05749,q-bio,"Large scale virological testing of SARS-Cov2 is implemented since May 2020 in France. We assume that the positivity of asymptomatic people not being contact cases (ANBC) is representative of the positivity of the whole French population, which allows estimating the real incidence. We estimate, using Sant\'e Public France reports, that the incidence at the beginning of August was about 0.8% and rose to about 2.4% of the total population at the beginning of September. This corresponds to about 1.6 million people simultaneously infected and 230.000 new infections each day. These evaluations allow to deduce that intensive care units (ICU) admission rate and infection fatality rate (IFR) dropped by one order of magnitude since March, and are currently 0.036% and 0.027% respectively. Basic simulations of the outbreak evolution based on the hypothesis of negligible reinfection probability are performed for France, Ile de France, Puy de Dome, Bouches du Rhone and Grand Est. These simulations are using a reproduction rate (R) constant over time ranging from 1.3 to 1.45 (1.15 in Grand Est). They use an estimation of the number of infection which occurred during the first wave. These simulations also use the estimated incidence, which by reducing the susceptible population weeks after weeks induces a saturation of the otherwise exponential growth of the outbreak. An incidence peak of 3.5 % is expected at week 39 for France. The calculated total number of ICU admission and deaths during the second wave are 9000 and 7000 respectively for R=1.3. The cumulative incidence over the two waves is computed close to 60% for R=1.3 and 70% for R=1.4. This suggests that if individual immunity exists, herd immunity is likely to be achieved in France by the end of October 2020. We conclude that Covid-19 is much more spread than previously thought, but its severity became limited since the end of the first wave.",20,[],10

2008.02388,q-bio,"A dynamic model of non-lineal time-dependent ordinary differential equations (ODE) has been applied to the interactions of a HIV infection with the immune system cells. This model has been simplified into two compartments: lymph node and peripheral blood. The model includes CD4 T-lymphocytes in several states (quiescent Q, naive N and activated T), cytotoxic CD8 T-cells, B-cells and dendritic cells. Cytokines and immunoglobulins specific for each antigen (i.e. gp41 or p24) have been also included in the model, modelling the atraction effect of CD4 T-cells to the infected area and the reduction of virus concentration by immunoglobulins. HIV virus infection of CD4 T-lymphocytes is modelled in several stages: before fusion as HIV-attached (H) and after fusion as non-permissive / abortively infected (M), and permissive / latently infected (L) and permissive / actively infected (I). These equations have been implemented in a C/Python interface application, called Immune System app, which runs Open Modelica software to solve the ODE system through a 4th order Runge-Kutta numerical approximation. Results of the simulation show that although HIV virus concentration in both compartments is lower than equation virus/equation after t=2 years, quiescent lymphocytes reach an equilibrium with a concentration lower than the initial conditions, due to the latency state, which serves as a reservoir in time of virus production. As a conclusion, this model can provide reliable results in other conditions, such as antiviral therapies.",20,[],10
2005.05858,q-bio,"Notch signaling is an evolutionary conserved cell-cell communication pathway. Besides regulating cell-fate decisions at an individual cell level, Notch signaling coordinates the emergent spatiotemporal patterning in a tissue through ligand-receptor interactions among transmembrane molecules of neighboring cells, as seen in embryonic development, angiogenesis, or wound healing. Due to its ubiquitous nature, Notch signaling is also implicated in several aspects of cancer progression, including tumor angiogenesis, stemness of cancer cells and cellular invasion. Here, we review experimental and computational models to help understand the operating principles of cell patterning driven by Notch signaling.

Since then, known as COVID-19 disease, the responsible viral pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, has spread around the world in a pandemic. Decisions on how to deal with the crisis are often based on simulations of the pandemic spread of the virus. The results of some of these, as well as their methodology and possibilities for improvement, will be described in more detail in this paper in order to inform beyond the current public health dogma called ""flatten-the-curve"". There are several ways to model an epidemic in order to simulate the spread of diseases. Depending on the timeliness, scope and quality of the associated real data, these multivariable models differ in the value of used parameters, but also in the selection of considered influencing factors. It was exemplarily shown that epidemics in their course are simulated more realistically by models that assume subexponential growth. Furthermore, various simulations of the COVID-19 pandemic were presented in an European perspective, compared against each other and discussed in more detail. It is difficult to estimate how credible the simulations of the pandemic models currently are, so it remains to be seen whether the spread of the pandemic can be effectively reduced by the measures taken. Whether a model works well in reality is largely determined by the quality and scope of its underlying data. Past studies have shown that countermeasures are able to reduce reproduction numbers or transmission rates in epidemics.

2005.00805,q-bio,"Seizure activity is a ubiquitous and pernicious pathophysiology that, in principle, should yield to mathematical treatments of (neuronal) ensemble dynamics - and therefore interventions on stochastic chaos. A seizure can be characterised as a deviation of neural activity from a stable dynamical regime, i.e. one in which signals fluctuate only within a limited range. In silico treatments of neural activity are an important tool for understanding how the brain can achieve stability, as well as how pathology can lead to seizures and potential strategies for mitigating instabilities, e.g. via external stimulation. Here, we demonstrate that the (neuronal) state equation used in Dynamic Causal Modelling generalises to a Fokker-Planck formalism when propagation of neuronal activity along structural connections is considered. Using the Jacobian of this generalised state equation, we show that an initially unstable system can be rendered stable via a reduction in diffusivity (i.e., connectivity that disperses neuronal fluctuations). We show, for neural systems prone to epileptic seizures, that such a reduction can be achieved via external stimulation. Specifically, we show that this stimulation should be applied in such a way as to temporarily mirror epileptic activity in the areas adjoining an affected brain region - thus 'fighting seizures with seizures'. We offer proof of principle using simulations based on functional neuroimaging data collected from patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy, in which we successfully suppress pathological activity in a distinct sub-network.

The performance of this methodology is thoroughly investigated in the face of several common challenges presented by biological data, namely, sparse data sampling, large noise levels, and heterogeneity between datasets. We find that this methodology can accurately infer the correct underlying equation and predict unobserved system dynamics from a small number of time samples when the data is sampled over a time interval exhibiting both linear and nonlinear dynamics.

2010.00740,q-bio,"Background: After a decade of a treatment as prevention (TasP) strategy based on progressive HIV testing scale-up and earlier treatment, a reduction in the estimated number of new infections in men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) in England had yet to be identified by 2010. To achieve internationally agreed targets for HIV control and elimination, test-and-treat prevention efforts have been dramatically intensified over the period 2010-2015, and, from 2016, further strengthened by pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).   Methods: Application of a novel age-stratified back-calculation approach to data on new HIV diagnoses and CD4 count-at-diagnosis, enabled age-specific estimation of HIV incidence, undiagnosed infections and mean time-to-diagnosis across both the 2010-2015 and 2016-2018 periods. Estimated incidence trends were then extrapolated, to quantify the likelihood of achieving HIV elimination by 2030.   Findings: A fall in HIV incidence in MSM is estimated to have started in 2012/3, eighteen months before the observed fall in new diagnoses. A steep decrease from 2,770 annual infections (95% credible interval 2.490-3,040) in 2013 to 1,740 (1,500-2,010) in 2015 is estimated, followed by steady decline from 2016, reaching 854 (441-1,540) infections in 2018. A decline is consistently estimated in all age groups, with a fall particularly marked in the 24-35 age group, and slowest in the 45 group. Comparable declines are estimated in the number of undiagnosed infections.   Interpretation: The peak and subsequent sharp decline in HIV incidence occurred prior to the phase-in of PrEP. Definining elimination as a public health threat to be < 50 new infections (1.1 infections per 10,000 at risk), 40% of incidence projections hit this threshold by 2030.

Methods. The tool uses a SEIR compartmental model to project the local spread of the pandemic. Users input case counts, healthcare resources, and select intervention strategies to evaluate.

2009.02443,q-bio,"Gene expression (GE) is an inherently random or stochastic or noisy process. The randomness in different steps of GE, e.g., transcription, translation, degradation, etc., leading to cell-to-cell variations in mRNA and protein levels. This variation appears in organisms ranging from microbes to metazoans. The random fluctuations in protein levels produce variability in cellular behavior. Stochastic gene expression has important consequences for cellular function. It is beneficial in some contexts and harmful to others. These situations include stress response, metabolism, development, cell cycle, circadian rhythms, and aging. Different model studies e.g., constitutive, two-state, etc., reveal that the fluctuations in mRNA and protein levels arise from different steps of gene expression among which the steps in transcription have the maximum effect. The pulsatile mRNA production through RNAP-II based reinitiation of transcription is an important part of gene expression. Though, the effect of that process on mRNA and protein levels is very little known. The addition of any biochemical step in the constitutive or two-state process generally decreases the mean and increases the Fano factor. In this study, we show that the RNAP-II based reinitiation process in gene expression can increase or decrease the mean and Fano factor both at the mRNA levels and therefore, can have important contributions on cellular functions.",20,[],10

The reaction system simply consists of two templates (T1, T2) and two enzymes (KF polymerase, Nb.BbvCI). The two templates are similar in structure (X-X-Y, Y-Y-C): primer recognition region, primer analogue generation region, output region (3 to 5), and there is a nicking site between each two regions. Output of T1 is the primer of T2 and G-rich fragment (G3) is designed as the final products. In the presence of HIV-1, numerous of G3 were generated owing to the multi-cycled amplification strategy and formed into G-triplex ThT complex after the addition of thioflavin T (ThT), which greatly enhanced the fluorescence intensity as signal reporter in the label-free sensing strategy. A dynamic response range of 50 fM-2 nM for HIV-1 gene detection can be achieved through this multi-cycled G-triplex machine, and benefit from the high efficiency amplification strategy, enzymatic reaction can be completed within 45 minutes followed by fluorescence measurement. In addition, analysis of other targets can be achieved by replacing the template sequence. Thus there is a certain application potential for trace biomarker analysis in this strategy.",20,[],10
2005.03408,q-bio,"Since the beginning of March 2020, the cumulative numbers of cases of infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in Germany have been reported on a daily basis. The reports originate from national laws, according to which positive test findings must be submitted to the Federal Health Authorities, the Robert Koch Institute, via the local health authorities. Since an enormous number of unreported cases can be expected, the question of how widespread the disease has been in the population cannot be answered based on these administrative reports. Using mathematical modeling, however, estimates can be made. These estimates indicate that the small numbers of diagnostic tests carried out at the beginning of the outbreak overlooked considerable parts of the infection. In order to cover the initial phase of future waves of the disease, wide-spread and comprehensive tests are recommended.",20,[],10
2006.11664,q-bio,"The spatial variation in the physico-chemical variables and macrobenthic invertebrates assemblage of a stretch of Ethiope River, Nigeria were evaluated for 6 months at five study stations. The results showed that temperature, dissolved oxygen and bicarbonates were similar across the study stations. The highest values of conductivity and total dissolved solids were recorded at station 1. The physico-chemical variables showed no significant different (P < 0.05) in the study stations. The abundance of the macrobenthic invertebrates comprises 61 taxa in 34 families, and the highest and least values occurred at stations 3 and 1 respectively. The Diptera which accounted for 52.77% of the overall abundance was the dominant group encountered, while the Decapoda (10.97%) which was prevalent in station 1 and the Ephemeroptera (8.05%) which was common in stations 2, 3 and 4 constituted the subdominant group. Over 68% of the oligochaetes recorded were restricted to station 3 except Dero limnosa and Nais sp that occurred in all the study stations. The overall abundance of the macrobenthic invertebrates was not significantly different (p < 0.05) among the study stations. Based on the canonical correspondence analyses, total dissolved solids, biochemical oxygen demand, bicarbonates and pH influenced the macrobenthic invertebrate assemblage. The study stretch of Ethiope River was reasonably free from gross pollution as indicated by the presence of Ephemeroptera, Tricoptera, Odonata and Decapoda at the study sites. However, there were indications of organic contamination as shown by the preponderance of naidid oligochaetes and certain dipteran species including the chironomids. This study revealed a high diversity of macrobenthic invertebrates, and this was attributed to the relative spatial homogeneity of the physico-chemical variables recorded at the study stations.",20,[],10
2003.13547,q-bio,"Objective: To conduct a meta-analysis of current studies that examined sex differences in severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and identify potential mechanisms underpinning these differences. Methods: We performed a systematic review to collate data from observational studies examining associations of sex differences with clinical outcomes of COVID-19. PubMed, Web of Science and four preprint servers were searched for relevant studies. Data were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis where possible, with summary data presented otherwise. Publicly available bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data were analyzed to explore the potential mechanisms underlying the observed association. Results: 39 studies met inclusion criteria, representing 77932 patients, of which 41510 (53.3%) were males. Men were at a markedly increased risk of developing severe cases compared with women. Furthermore, the pooled odds ratio (OR) of mortality for male group compared with the female group indicated significant higher mortality rate for male. Data from scRNA-seq suggest that men have a higher amount of ACE2-expressing pulmonary alveolar type II cells than women. Sex-based immunological differences exist. The expression of androgen receptor (AR) is positively correlated with ACE2, and there is evidence that AR may directly regulate the expression of ACE2. Conclusions: This meta-analysis detected an increased severity and mortality rate in the male populations with COVID-19, which might be attributable to the sex-based differences in cellular compositions and immunological microenvironments of the lung. The host cell receptor ACE2 is likely regulated by AR signaling pathway, which is identified as a potential target for prevention and treatment of SARS-Cov-2 infections in men.",20,[],10

Experiments support many forms and sizes of neural clustering, while neural mass models (NMM) assume scale-invariant functionality. Here, we use computational simulations with brain-derived fMRI network to show that not only brain network stays structurally self-similar continuously across scales, but also neuron-like signal integration functionality is preserved at particular scales. As such, we propose a coarse-graining of network of neurons to ensemble-nodes, with multiple spikes making up its ensemble-spike, and time re-scaling factor defining its ensemble-time step.

Levansucrase (LS, EC 2.4.1.10), a fructosyl-transferase, can catalyze the synthesis of these compounds. LS acquires a fructosyl residue from a donor molecule and performs a non-Lenoir transfer to an acceptor molecule, via equation-(2equation6)-glycosidic linkages. Genome mining was used to uncover new LS enzymes with increased transfructosylating activity and wider acceptor promiscuity, with an initial screening revealing five LS enzymes. The product profiles and activities of these enzymes were examined after their incubation with sucrose. Alternate acceptor molecules were also incubated with the enzymes to study their consumption. LSs from Gluconobacter oxydans and Novosphingobium aromaticivorans synthesized fructooligosaccharides (FOSs) with up to 13 units in length. Alignment of their amino acid sequences and substrate docking with homology models identified structural elements causing differences in their product spectra. Raffinose, over sucrose, was the preferred donor molecule for the LS from Vibrio natriegens, N. aromaticivorans, and Paraburkolderia graminis.

2003.10236,q-bio,"Immunotherapies use components of the patient immune system to selectively target cancer cells. The use of CAR T cells to treat B-cell malignancies --leukaemias and lymphomas-- is one of the most successful examples, with many patients experiencing long-lasting complete responses to this therapy. This treatment works by extracting the patient's T cells and adding them the CAR group, which enables them to recognize and target cells carrying the antigen CD19, that is expressed in these haematological tumors.   Here we put forward a mathematical model describing the time response of leukaemias to the injection of CAR T-cells. The model accounts for mature and progenitor B-cells, tumor cells, CAR T cells and side effects by incorporating the main biological processes involved. The model explains the early post-injection dynamics of the different compartments and the fact that the number of CAR T cells injected does not critically affect the treatment outcome. An explicit formula is found that provides the maximum CAR T cell expansion in-vivo and the severity of side effects. Our mathematical model captures other known features of the response to this immunotherapy. It also predicts that CD19 tumor relapses could be the result of the competition between tumor and CAR T cells analogous to predator-prey dynamics. We discuss this fact on the light of available evidences and the possibility of controlling relapses by early re-challenging of the tumor with stored CAR T cells.",20,[],10
2008.06367,q-bio,"Background: Human gait exhibits complex fractal fluctuations among consecutive strides. The time series of gait parameters are long-range correlated (statistical persistence). In contrast, when gait is synchronized with external rhythmic cues, the fluctuation regime is modified to stochastic oscillations around the target frequency (statistical anti-persistence). To highlight these two fluctuation modes, the prevalent methodology is the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). The DFA outcome is the scaling exponent, which lies between 0.5 and 1 if the time series exhibit long-range correlations, and below 0.5 if the time series is anti-correlated. A fundamental assumption for applying DFA is that the analyzed time series results from a time-invariant generating process. However, a gait time series may be constituted by an ensemble of sub-segments with distinct fluctuation regimes (e.g., correlated and anti-correlated). Methods: Several proportions of correlated and anti-correlated time series were mixed together and then analyzed through DFA. The original (before mixing) time series were generated via autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) modelling or actual gait data. Results: Results evidenced a nonlinear sensitivity of DFA to the mix of correlated and anti-correlated series. Notably, adding a small proportion of correlated segments into an anti-correlated time series had stronger effects than the reverse. Significance: In case of changes in gait control during a walking trial, the resulting time series may be a patchy ensemble of several fluctuation regimes. When applying DFA, the scaling exponent may be misinterpreted. Cued walking studies may be most at risk of suffering this issue in cases of sporadic synchronization with external cues.",20,[],10
2007.02580,q-bio,"Seasonality of acute viral respiratory diseases is a well-known and yet not fully understood phenomenon. Several models have been proposed to explain the regularity of yearly recurring outbreaks and the phase-differences observed at different latitudes on Earth. Such models take into account known internal causes, primarily the periodic emergence of new virus variants that evade the host immune response. Yet, this alone, is generally unable to explain the regularity of recurrences and the observed phase-differences. Here we show that seasonality of viral respiratory diseases, as well as its distribution with latitude on Earth, can be fully explained by the virucidal properties of UV-B and A Solar photons through a daily, minute-scale, resonant forcing mechanism. Such an induced periodicity can last, virtually unperturbed, from tens to hundreds of cycles, and even in presence of internal dynamics (host's loss of immunity) much slower than seasonal will, on a long period, generate seasonal oscillations.",20,[],10

2005.08353,q-bio,"Myelinated neurons are characterized by the presence of myelin, a multilaminated wrapping around the axons formed by specialized neuroglial cells. Myelin acts as an electrical insulator and therefore, in myelinated neurons, the action potentials do not propagate within the axons but happen only at the nodes of Ranvier which are gaps in the axonal myelination. Recent advancements in brain science have shown that the shapes, timings, and propagation speeds of these so-called saltatory action potentials are controlled by various biochemical interactions among neurons, glial cells, and the extracellular space. Given the complexity of brain's structure and processes, the work hypothesis made in this paper is that non-local effects are involved in the optimal propagation of action potentials. A space-fractional cable equation for the action potentials propagation in myelinated neurons is proposed that involves spatial derivatives of fractional order. The effects of non-locality on the distribution of the membrane potential are investigated using numerical simulations.",20,[],10

The method is as simple to use as deploying a conventional static sound recorder, but provides tracking information as well as sound recordings. The principal of operation is to detect the phase difference between microphones positioned closely together. The phase is detected by converting the signals to their analytic form with a Hilbert transform. The angle is then calculated from the phase difference, frequency and microphone separation. Angular measurements provide flight paths above the sensor, and can give details of activity and behaviour that are not possible with a single channel static recorder. We recorded flight paths for 5 bat species on a single night at a site in Denmark (Pipistrellus nathusii, Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Eptesicus serotinus, Myotis daubentonii and Nyctalus noctula). The median error in angular measurement for the species was between 3 and 7 degrees.

2004.03326,q-bio,"Cotranslational folding depends on the folding speed and stability of the nascent protein. It remains difficult, however, to predict which proteins cotranslationally fold. Here, we simulate evolution of model proteins to investigate how native structure influences evolution of cotranslational folding. We developed a model that connects protein folding during and after translation to cellular fitness. Model proteins evolved improved folding speed and stability, with proteins adopting one of two strategies for folding quickly. Low contact order proteins evolve to fold cotranslationally. Such proteins adopt native conformations early on during the translation process, with each subsequently translated residue establishing additional native contacts. On the other hand, high contact order proteins tend not to be stable in their native conformations until the full chain is nearly extruded. We also simulated evolution of slowly translating codons, finding that slower translation speeds at certain positions enhances cotranslational folding. Finally, we investigated real protein structures using a previously published dataset that identified evolutionarily conserved rare codons in E. coli genes and associated such codons with cotranslational folding intermediates. We found that protein substructures preceding conserved rare codons tend to have lower contact orders, in line with our finding that lower contact order proteins are more likely to fold cotranslationally. Our work shows how evolutionary selection pressure can cause proteins with local contact topologies to evolve cotranslational folding.",20,[],10

In the past 50 years, attention was almost exclusively given to low dimensional systems and calibration of their resilience functions and indicators of early warning signals without considerations for the interactions between the components. Only in recent years, taking advantages of the network theory and lavish real data sets, network scientists have directed their interest to the real-world complex networked multidimensional systems and their resilience function and early warning indicators.

The fate of any gene drive released in a population would be inextricably linked to the ecology of the population. Given the uncertainty often involved in ecological assessment of natural populations, understanding the sensitivity of gene drive spread to important ecological factors is critical.

2001.10531,q-bio,"Background. Pneumococcal vaccination (PCV13) for children (as well as older adults) in Russia was introduced in 2014, with no prior PCV7 use. While pneumonia hospitalization rates, both in children and adults did not decrease in the following years, respiratory mortality rates did decline with time. Moreover, there is a strong association between antibiotic, including multidrug resistance and PCV13 vaccine serotypes for S. pneumoniae in children in Russia, and presence of S. pneumoniae among sepsis cases in Russia during the recent years has been very low. Annual variability in influenza circulation may affect some of the changes in respiratory mortality rates. Methods. We applied the inference method from our recent study of influenza-associated mortality in Russia to relate monthly respiratory mortality rates between 09/2010 and 08/2019 to monthly indices of influenza circulation and baseline rates of mortality not associated with influenza, allowing for a potential trend in the baseline rates starting 2015. Results. Baseline rates of respiratory mortality not associated with influenza decreased with time starting from the 2014/15 season (with each season running from September to August), with the 2018/19 baseline rates of respiratory mortality per 100,000 individuals being lower by 12.41 (95% CI (10.6,14.2)) compared to the 2010-2014 period. Conclusions. While improvement in care might have contributed to the reduction in the rates of respiratory mortality not associated with influenza in Russia, the above temporally consistent reduction is compatible with the gradual replacement of vaccine serotypes in the transmission and carriage of S. pneumoniae following the introduction of PCV13.

2004.09849,q-bio,"Background Brain tumours represent the highest cause of mortality in the paediatric oncological population. Diagnosis is commonly performed with magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. Survival biomarkers are challenging to identify due to the relatively low numbers of individual tumour types, especially for rare tumour types such as atypical rhabdoid tumours.   Methods 69 children with biopsy-confirmed brain tumours were recruited into this study. All participants had both perfusion and diffusion weighted imaging performed at diagnosis. Data were processed using conventional methods, and a Bayesian survival analysis performed. Unsupervised and supervised machine learning were performed with the survival features, to determine novel sub-groups related to survival. Sub-group analysis was undertaken to understand differences in imaging features, which pertain to survival.   Findings Survival analysis showed that a combination of diffusion and perfusion imaging were able to determine two novel sub-groups of brain tumours with different survival characteristics (p <0.01), which were subsequently classified with high accuracy (98%) by a neural network. Further analysis of high-grade tumours showed a marked difference in survival (p=0.029) between the two clusters with high risk and low risk imaging features.

2008.05744,q-bio,"To improve understanding of the physiology, ecology and regeneration requirements of black poplar (Populus nigra), a severely endangered tree species in Europe, we analysed the biochemical composition of seeds from 20 families derived from open pollination of 20 trees in two contrasting environments in France, along the Dr\ome and Loire rivers. Significant between-family differences were detected. Total lipid contents differed qualitatively between seed of the two populations and were higher in Dr\ome population (214 more or less 29.8 versus 172.72 more or less 19.77 mg.g\-1 dw). Soluble sugars were less abundant in seeds of the Dr\ome population (78.78 more or less 10.01 versus 104.10 more or less 25.32 mg.g\-1 dw). The protein content (322 more or less 74.3 mg.g\-1 dw) and quantity of reserve proteins did not differ between seeds of the two populations. Measurements in three consecutive years showed that seeds of the Loire population had significantly higher dry weight (0.69 more or less 0.10 versus 0.45 more or less 0.10 mg.g\-1 dw), but this did not significantly affect the germination rate or root growth of the seedlings measured 5 days after sowing. However, one group of Loire seedlings had substantially longer juvenile roots than another group. Overall, the results suggest that intrinsic qualities of the seeds are not critical factors in early stages and in selection pressure of the species life cycle and recruitment.",20,[],10

In this opinion piece, we explicitly address the diversity of goals that motivate and ultimately influence modeling efforts. We argue that a wide range of goals can be meaningfully taken to be of highest importance. A simple informal survey conducted on the Internet confirmed the diversity of goals in the community. However, different priorities or preferences of individual researchers can lead to divergent model evaluation criteria. We propose that many disagreements in evaluating the merit of computational research stem from differences in goals and not from the mechanics of constructing, describing, and validating models. We suggest that authors state explicitly their goals when proposing models so that others can judge the quality of the research with respect to its stated goals.",20,[],10

Microscopic models, which take into account the details of the new social and economical conditions, would require a complex dynamics of the stakeholders. We discuss a less detailed approach which, on the basis of the collected data after few days from the beginning of the new phase, outlines different scenarios of the Covid-19 diffusion for longer time.

2007.12523,q-bio,"To increase situational awareness and support evidence-based policy-making, we formulated two types of mathematical models for COVID-19 transmission within a regional population.

The other is a compartmental model that accounts for quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing, a non-exponentially distributed incubation period, asymptomatic individuals, and mild and severe forms of symptomatic disease. Using Bayesian inference, we have been calibrating our models daily for consistency with new reports of confirmed cases from the 15 most populous metropolitan statistical areas in the United States and quantifying uncertainty in parameter estimates and predictions of future case reports.

2008.00629,q-bio,"The brain constructs population codes to represent stimuli through widely distributed patterns of activity across neurons. An important figure of merit of population codes is how much information about the original stimulus can be decoded from them. Fisher information is widely used to quantify coding precision and specify optimal codes, because of its relationship to mean squared error (MSE) under certain assumptions. When neural firing is sparse, however, optimizing Fisher information can result in codes that are highly sub-optimal in terms of MSE. We find that this discrepancy arises from the non-local component of error not accounted for by the Fisher information. Using this insight, we construct optimal population codes by directly minimizing the MSE. We study the scaling properties of MSE with coding parameters, focusing on the tuning curve width. We find that the optimal tuning curve width for coding no longer scales as the inverse population size, and the quadratic scaling of precision with system size predicted by Fisher information alone no longer holds. However, superlinearity is still preserved with only a logarithmic slowdown. We derive analogous results for networks storing the memory of a stimulus through continuous attractor dynamics, and show that similar scaling properties optimize memory and representation.",20,[],10
2007.07797,q-bio,"A common feature in many neuroscience datasets is the presence of hierarchical data structures, most commonly recording the activity of multiple neurons in multiple animals across multiple trials. Accordingly, the measurements constituting the dataset are not independent, even though the traditional statistical analyses often applied in such cases (e.g., Students t-test) treat them as such. The hierarchical bootstrap has been shown to be an effective tool to accurately analyze such data and while it has been used extensively in the statistical literature, its use is not widespread in neuroscience - despite the ubiquity of hierarchical datasets. In this paper, we illustrate the intuitiveness and utility of this approach to analyze hierarchically nested datasets. We use simulated neural data to show that traditional statistical tests can result in a false positive rate of over 45%, even if the Type-I error rate is set at 5%. While summarizing data across non-independent points (or lower levels) can potentially fix this problem, this approach greatly reduces the statistical power of the analysis. The hierarchical bootstrap, when applied sequentially over the levels of the hierarchical structure, keeps the Type-I error rate within the intended bound and retains more statistical power than summarizing methods. We conclude by demonstrating the effectiveness of the method in two real-world examples, first analyzing singing data in male Bengalese finches (Lonchura striata var. domestica) and second quantifying changes in behavior under optogenetic control in flies (Drosophila melanogaster).",20,[],10

They were described by Lansdown Guilding (1797-1831). This paper identifies the landmarks of their study, in a worldwide level, for almost 200 years. The beginning, 1826-1879, was based on describing their anatomy with light miscroscopy, mostly by famous French naturalists such as Milne-Edwards and Blanchard. In 1880-1929 peiord, work concentrated in anatomy, physiology, behavior, biogeography and ecology, but the most important work was Bouvier`s mammoth monograph. The next period, 1930-1979, was important for the discovery of Cambrian species; Vachons explanation of how ancient distribution defined the existence of two families; Pioneer DNA and electron microscopy from Brazil; and primitive attempts at systematics using embryology or isolated anatomical characteristics. Finally, the 1980-2020 period, with research centered in Australia, Brazil, Costa Rica and Germany, is marked by an evolutionary approach to everything, from body and behavior to distribution; for the solution of the old problem of how they form their adhesive net and how the glue works; the reconstruction of Cambrian onychophoran communities, the first experimental taphonomy; the first countrywide map of conservation status (from Costa Rica); the first model of why they survive in cities; the discovery of new phenomena like food hiding, parental feeding investment and ontogenetic diet shift; and for the birth of a new research branh, Onychophoran Etnobiology, founded in 2015,",20,[],10
2002.04136,q-bio,"In adults, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) reduces inflammation. In neonates, the effects of VNS are not known. An electrocardiogram (ECG)-derived heart rate variability (HRV) index reliably tracks the inflammatory response induced by low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in near-term sheep fetuses. We evaluated the VNS effect on the systemic inflammatory response induced by a high dose of LPS in neonatal piglets to mimic late-onset neonatal sepsis. Next, we tested if our HRV inflammatory index tracks inflammation in piglets. Following anesthesia, electrodes were attached to the left vagal nerve; ECG and blood pressure (BP) were recorded throughout the experiment. Following baseline, the piglets were administered LPS as 2mg/kg IV bolus. In the VNS treated piglet, the vagus nerve was stimulated for 10 minutes prior to and 10 min after the injection of LPS. In both groups, every 15 min post LPS, the arterial blood sample was drawn for blood gas, metabolites, and inflammatory cytokines. At the end of the experiment, the piglets were euthanized. BP and HRV measures were calculated. The piglets developed a potent inflammatory response to the LPS injection with TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-8 peaking between 45 and 90 min post-injection. VNS diminished the LPS-induced systemic inflammatory response varying across the measured cytokines from two to ten-fold. The HRV index tracked accurately the cytokines' temporal profile. This novel model allows manipulating and tracking neonatal sepsis: The HRV inflammatory index 1) applies across species pre- and postnatally and 2) performs well at different degrees of sepsis (i.e., nanogram and milligram doses of LPS); 3) the present VNS paradigm effectively suppresses LPS-induced inflammation, even at high doses of LPS. The potential of early postnatal VNS to counteract sepsis and of HRV monitoring to early detect and track it deserve further study.",20,[],10

For this study, the de novo mutation data within human is used to estimate mutational rate instead of using base substitution data between related species. We then define a new measure of mutation bias which separate the de novo mutation counts from the background guanine-cytosine content itself, making comparison between different datasets easier. We derive a new formula for calculating limiting guanine-cytosine content by separating CpG-involved mutational events as an independent variable. Using the formula when CpG-involved mutations are considered, the guanine-cytosine content drops less severely in the limit of neutral dynamics. We provide evidence, under certain assumptions, that an isochore-like structure might remain as a limiting configuration of the neutral mutational dynamics.",20,[],10
2006.11975,q-bio,"The hippocampus is an essential brain region for spatial memory and learning. Recently, a theoretical model study on the hippocampus applying temporal difference (TD) learning, one of reinforcement learning algorithms, has been published. The theory was inspired by the successor representation (SR) learning algorithms, which decompose value function of TD learning into reward and state transition: it argued that the probability of state transition is represented by the rate of firing of CA1 place cells in the hippocampus. This theory, called predictive map theory, claims that the hippocampus representing space learns the probability of transition from the current state to the future state. The neural correlates of expecting the future state are the firing rates of the CA1 place cells. This explanation is plausible for the results recorded in behavioral experiments, but it is lacking the neurobiological implications.   I tried to add biological implications to the predictive map theory by modifying the SR learning algorithm. Similar with the simultaneous needs of information of the current and future state in the SR learning algorithm, the CA1 pyramidal neurons receive two inputs from CA3 and entorhinal cortex. Mathematical transformation showed that the SR learning algorithm is equivalent to the heterosynaptic plasticity rule. Then I discussed papers that reported heterosynaptic plasticity phenomena in CA1; and I compared them with our transformed rule from SR the algorithm.

Since the first patient was hospitalized on December 12, 2019, China has reported a total of 78,824 confirmed CONID-19 cases and 2,788 deaths as of February 28, 2020. Wuhan's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths accounted for 61.1% and 76.5% of the whole China mainland , making it the priority center for epidemic prevention and control. Meanwhile, 51 countries and regions outside China have reported 4,879 confirmed cases and 79 deaths as of February 28, 2020. COVID-19 epidemic does great harm to people's daily life and country's economic development. This paper adopts three kinds of mathematical models, i.e., Logistic model, Bertalanffy model and Gompertz model.

The prediction results of three different mathematical models are different for different parameters and in different regions. In general, the fitting effect of Logistic model may be the best among the three models studied in this paper, while the fitting effect of Gompertz model may be better than Bertalanffy model.

The resultant demographic consequences, mostly on sex imbalance, are well documented, typically including ""missing girls/women"" and ""marriage squeeze."" However, the SRB-induced impact on demographic dynamics, particularly its underlying mechanism, has not been explored in depth. We aim to investigate the impact of the SRB rise on the size, structure, and growth of a population, particularly emphasizing on population aging. We provide a simple framework, derived from classical stable population models, to analyze how the SRB rise can reduce the population size and make the population old. We demonstrate that the cohorts born with a higher SRB are smaller in size than those with a lower SRB. As the affected cohorts are born into the population, their smaller size will reduce the total population size, thereby lifting the fraction of old people that were born with the original SRB and have the same size as before. The resultant population aging speed increases as the cohorts with the new SRB take an increasing share of the population. This study adds that, in addition to fertility and mortality, the SRB can be a driving factor of population dynamics, especially when it moves far above normal biological levels.",20,[],10
2011.04354,q-bio,"Transcription factors are proteins that regulate gene activity by activating or repressing gene transcription. A special class of transcriptional repressors operate via a short-range mechanism, making local DNA regions inaccessible to binding by activators and, thus, providing an indirect repressive action on the target gene. This mechanism is commonly modeled assuming that the repressors interact with the DNA under thermodynamic equilibrium. The equilibrium approach to short-range repression makes it necessary to neglect some configurations of the gene regulatory region. We elaborate a more general non-equilibrium model of short-range repression using the graph formalism for transitions between gene states and apply analytical calculations to compare it with the equilibrium model in terms of the repression strength and expression noise. In contrast to the equilibrium approach, the new model allows to separate two basic mechanisms of short-range repression. The first mechanism is associated with the recruiting of factors that mediate chromatin condensation, and the second one concerns the blocking of factors that mediate chromatin loosening. The non-equilibrium model demonstrates better performance on previously published gene expression data obtained for transcription factors controlling Drosophila development and, furthermore, predicts that the first repression mechanism is the most favorable in this system. The presented approach can be scaled to larger gene networks and can be used to infer specific modes and parameters of transcriptional regulation from gene expression data.",20,[],10

Recent experiments have demonstrated that microwave photons, as well as phonons, can be used to couple superconducting qubits, with a fidelity limited primarily by loss in the communication channel. Adiabatic protocols can overcome channel loss by transferring quantum states without populating the lossy communication channel. Here we present a unique superconducting quantum communication system, comprising two superconducting qubits connected by a 0.73 m-long communication channel. Significantly, we can introduce large tunable loss to the channel, allowing exploration of different entanglement protocols in the presence of dissipation. When set for minimum loss in the channel, we demonstrate an adiabatic quantum state transfer protocol that achieves 99% transfer efficiency as well as the deterministic generation of entangled Bell states with a fidelity of 96%, all without populating the intervening communication channel, and competitive with a qubit-resonant mode-qubit relay method.

In this work, we propose a novel approach to reduce ansatz circuit depth. Our approach, called PermVQE, adds an additional optimization loop to VQE that permutes qubits in order to solve for the qubit Hamiltonian that minimizes long-range correlations in the ground state. The choice of permutations is based on mutual information, which is a measure of interaction between electrons in spin-orbitals. Encoding strongly interacting spin-orbitals into proximal qubits on a quantum chip naturally reduces the circuit depth needed to prepare the ground state. For representative molecular systems, LiH, Hequation, (Hequation)equation, Hequation, and Hequation, we demonstrate for linear qubit connectivity that placing entangled qubits in close proximity leads to shallower depth circuits required to reach a given eigenvalue-eigenvector accuracy. This approach can be extended to any qubit connectivity and can significantly reduce the depth required to reach a desired accuracy in VQE.

2009.08840,quant-ph,"Suppose we want to implement a unitary equation, for instance a circuit for some quantum algorithm. Suppose our actual implementation is a unitary equation, which we can only apply as a black-box. In general it is an exponentially-hard task to decide whether equation equals the intended equation, or is significantly different in a worst-case norm. In this paper we consider two special cases where relatively efficient and lightweight procedures exist for this task.   First, we give an efficient procedure under the assumption that equation and equation (both of which we can now apply as a black-box) are either equal, or differ significantly in only one equation-qubit gate, where equation (the equation qubits need not be contiguous). Second, we give an even more lightweight procedure under the assumption that equation and equation are Clifford circuits which are either equal, or different in arbitrary ways (the specification of equation is now classically given while equation can still only be applied as a black-box). Both procedures only need to run equation a constant number of times to detect a constant error in a worst-case norm. We note that the Clifford result also follows from earlier work of Flammia and Liu, and of da Silva, Landon-Cardinal, and Poulin.   In the Clifford case, our error-detection procedure also allows us to efficiently learn (and hence correct) equation if we have a small list of possible errors that could have happened to equation; for example if we know that only equation of the gates of equation are wrong, this list will be polynomially small and we can test each possible erroneous version of equation for equality with equation.",20,[],6

The position uncertainty in the measured data is reduced and squeezed to equation times the zero-point amplitude equation with a purity of about 0.001, by means of optimal state estimation through causal Wiener filtering. The purity of the squeezed state is clearly maximized by the Wiener filter, based on precisely identified optomechanical parameters. This is the first step for measurement-based quantum control of macroscopic pendulums, e.g. generation of an entanglement state between macroscopic pendulums. Such quantum control will provide a direct insight into the quantum to classical transition and will pave the way to test semiclassical gravity and gravity sourced by macroscopic quantum oscillators.",20,[],6
2009.07949,quant-ph,"We evaluate the exact dipole coupling strength between a single emitter and the radiation field within an optical cavity, taking into account the effects of multilayer dielectric mirrors. Our model allows one to freely vary the resonance frequency of the cavity, the frequency of light or atomic transition addressing it and the design wavelength of the dielectric mirror. The coupling strength is derived for an open system with unbound frequency modes. For very short cavities, the effective length used to determine their mode volume and the lengths defining their resonances are different, and also found to diverge appreciably from their geometric length, with the radiation field being strongest within the dielectric mirror itself. Only for cavities much longer than their resonant wavelength does the mode volume asymptotically approach that normally assumed from their geometric length.",20,[],6

2006.13794,quant-ph,"Quantum computational experiments exploiting Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices to demonstrate violation of a Bell inequality are proposed. They consist of running specified quantum algorithms on few-qubit computers. If such a device assures entanglement and performs single-shot measurements, the detection loophole is avoided. Four concise quantum circuits determining the expectation values of the relevant observables are used for a two-qubit system. It is possible to add an ancilla qubit to these circuits and eventually only measure the ancilla to obtain the relevant information. For a four-qubit NISQ computer, two algorithms yielding the same averages, however also guaranteeing a random choice of the observable, are developed. A freedom-of-choice loophole is therefore avoided. Including an additional ancilla reduces the number of measurements by one since in this case only the ancillas need to be measured. Note that these methods, using the NISQ device, are intrinsically quantum mechanical. Locality loopholes cannot be excluded on present NISQ systems. Results of simulations on the QX simulator of Quantum Inspire are presented. The Bell inequality is indeed found to be violated, even if some additional noise is included by means of the depolarizing channel error model. The algorithms have been implemented on the IBM Q Experience as well. The results of these quantum computations support a violation of the Bell inequality by various standard deviations.",20,[],6

The fermions undergo energy-dependent transitions from ergodic to Stark many-body localization driven by the tilted potential, which are manifested by the appearance of mobility edges between delocalized states and Stark many-body localized states even when the disorder is weak. We can concretely diagnose these transitions rather than crossovers by finite-size scaling of energy-level statistics. Moreover, in the Stark many-body localization, the entanglement entropy obeys the area law scaling, in analogy to that in the conventional many-body localization.",20,[],6

In this paper, we incorporate derivatives of Hamiltonian into VQE and develop some hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, which explores both Hamiltonian and wavefunction spaces for optimization. Aiming for solving quantum chemistry problems more efficiently, we first propose mutual gradient descent algorithm for geometry optimization by updating parameters of Hamiltonian and wavefunction alternatively, which shows a rapid convergence towards equilibrium structures of molecules. We then establish differential equations that governs how optimized variational parameters of wavefunction change with intrinsic parameters of the Hamiltonian, which can speed up calculation of energy potential surface.

2009.02588,quant-ph,"In a recent paper, I argued against backward in time effects used by several authors to explain delayed choice experiments. I gave an explanation showing that there is no physical influence propagating from the present to the past and modifying the state of the system at a time previous to the measurement. However, though the solution is straightforward in the case of delayed choice experiments involving only one particle, it is subtler in the case of experiments involving two entangled particles because they give rise to EPR-like situations. Considering that a measurement is not an actual change of the physical state of a system and is relative to the observer allows to understand that there is neither backward in time effects nor instantaneous collapse of the second system when the first one is measured, as is often postulated.This allows also to get rid of any non-locality. In this paper, I want to go further into the consequences of this way of considering the measurement, that I have called Convivial Solipsism, and show that even if, in the usual sense, there is no physical effect of the present or of the future on the past, we must nevertheless consider that the observer's past is sometimes not entirely determined and that it becomes determined only when certain measurements are done latter. This apparent contradiction disappears if one understand that each observer builds, through her own measurements, her own world (that I call the phenomenal world in Convivial Solipsism) which is different from what we are used to consider as the common world shared by everybody.",20,[],6
2003.08418,quant-ph,"Future quantum repeater architectures, capable of efficiently distributing information encoded in quantum states of light over large distances, will benefit from multiplexed photonic quantum memories. In this work we demonstrate a temporally multiplexed quantum repeater node in a laser-cooled cloud of equationRb atoms. We employ the DLCZ protocol where pairs of photons and single collective spin excitations (so called spin waves) are created in several temporal modes using a train of write pulses. To make the spin waves created in different temporal modes distinguishable and enable selective readout, we control the dephasing and rephasing of the spin waves by a magnetic field gradient, which induces a controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening of the involved atomic hyperfine levels. We demonstrate that by embedding the atomic ensemble inside a low finesse optical cavity, the additional noise generated in multi-mode operation is strongly suppressed. By employing feed forward readout, we demonstrate distinguishable retrieval of up to 10 temporal modes. For each mode, we prove non-classical correlations between the first and second photon. Furthermore, an enhancement in rates of correlated photon pairs is observed as we increase the number of temporal modes stored in the memory. The reported capability is a key element of a quantum repeater architecture based on multiplexed quantum memories.",20,[],6
2011.07050,quant-ph,"Improving two-qubit gate performance and suppressing crosstalk are major, but often competing, challenges to achieving scalable quantum computation. In particular, increasing the coupling to realize faster gates has been intrinsically linked to enhanced crosstalk due to unwanted two-qubit terms in the Hamiltonian. Here, we demonstrate a novel coupling architecture for transmon qubits that circumvents the standard relationship between desired and undesired interaction rates. Using two fixed frequency coupling elements to tune the dressed level spacings, we demonstrate an intrinsic suppression of the static equation, while maintaining large effective coupling rates. Our architecture reveals no observable degradation of qubit coherence (equation) and, over a factor of 6 improvement in the ratio of desired to undesired coupling.

2002.11620,quant-ph,"Exceptional points (EPs) are degeneracies of classical and quantum open systems, which are studied in many areas of physics including optics, optoelectronics, plasmonics, and condensed matter physics. In the semiclassical regime, open systems can be described by phenomenological effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians (NHHs) capturing the effects of gain and loss in terms of imaginary fields. The EPs that characterize the spectra of such Hamiltonians (HEPs) describe the time evolution of a system without quantum jumps. It is well known that a full quantum treatment describing more generic dynamics must crucially take into account such quantum jumps. In a recent paper [F. Minganti equation equation, Phys. Rev. A equation, equation (equation)], we generalized the notion of EPs to the spectra of Liouvillian superoperators governing open system dynamics described by Lindblad master equations. Intriguingly, we found that in situations where a classical-to-quantum correspondence exists, the two types of dynamics can yield different EPs. In a recent experimental work [M. Naghiloo equation equation, Nat. Phys. equation, equation (equation)], it was shown that one can engineer a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in the quantum limit by postselecting on certain quantum jump trajectories. This raises an interesting question concerning the relation between Hamiltonian and Lindbladian EPs, and quantum trajectories. We discuss these connections by introducing a hybrid-Liouvillian superoperator, capable of describing the passage from an NHH (when one postselects only those trajectories without quantum jumps) to a true Liouvillian including quantum jumps (without postselection). Beyond its fundamental interest, our approach allows to intuitively relate the effects of postselection and finite-efficiency detectors.",20,[],6
2009.09499,quant-ph,"The notorious Wigner's friend thought experiment (and modifications thereof) has in recent years received renewed interest especially due to new arguments that force us to question some of the fundamental assumptions of quantum theory. In this paper, we formulate a no-go theorem for the persistent reality of Wigner's friend's perception, which allows us to conclude that the perceptions that the friend has of her own measurement outcomes at different times cannot ""share the same reality"", if seemingly natural quantum mechanical assumptions are met. More formally, this means that, in a Wigner's friend scenario, there is no joint probability distribution for the friend's perceived measurement outcomes at two different times, that depends linearly on the initial state of the measured system and whose marginals reproduce the predictions of unitary quantum theory. This theorem entails that one must either (1) propose a nonlinear modification of the Born rule for two-time predictions, (2) sometimes prohibit the use of present information to predict the future --thereby reducing the predictive power of quantum theory-- or (3) deny that unitary quantum mechanics makes valid single-time predictions for all observers.

2006.00708,quant-ph,"Quantum communication has been leading the way of many remarkable theoretical results and experimental tests in physics. In this context, quantum communication complexity (QCC) has recently drawn earnest research attention as a tool to optimize the amounts of transmitted qubits and energy that are required to implement distributed computational tasks. On this matter, we introduce a novel multi-user quantum fingerprinting protocol that is ready to be implemented with existing technology. Particularly, we extend to the multi-user framework a well-known two-user coherent-state fingerprinting scheme. This generalization is highly non-trivial for a twofold reason, as it requires not only to extend the set of protocol rules but also to specify a procedure for designing the optical devices intended for the generalized protocol. Much of the importance of our work arises from the fact that the obtained QCC figures of merit allow direct comparison with the best-known classical multi-user fingerprinting protocol, of significance in the field of computer technologies and networking. Furthermore, as one of the main contributions of the manuscript, we deduce innovative analytical upper bounds on the amount of transmitted quantum information that are even valid in the two-user protocol as a particular case. Ultimately, comparative results are provided to contrast different protocol implementation strategies and, importantly, to show that, under realistic circumstances, the multi-user protocol can achieve tasks that are impossible by using classical communication alone. Our work provides relevant contributions towards understanding the nature and the limitations of quantum fingerprinting and, on a broader scope, also the limitations and possibilities of quantum-communication networks embracing a node that is accessed by multiple users at the same time.",20,[],6

2006.12271,quant-ph,"Using the zero time-delay second-order correlation function for studying the photon statistics, we investigate how the photon statistics of the field-modes generated by parametric down-conversion (PDC) process depends on the photon statistics of the pump field-mode. We derive general expressions for the zero time-delay second-order correlation function of the down-converted field-modes for both multi-mode and single-mode PDC processes. We further study these expressions in the weak down-conversion limit. We show that for a two-photon two-mode PDC process, in which a pump photon splits into two photons into two separate field-modes, the zero time-delay second-order correlation function of the individual down-converted field-modes is equal to twice that of the pump field-mode. Furthermore, for an equation-photon equation-mode down-conversion process, in which a pump photon splits into equation photons into equation separate field-modes, the zero time-delay second-order correlation function of the individual down-converted field-modes is equal to equation times that of the pump field-mode. However, in contrast to the multi-mode PDC processes, for a single-mode PDC process, in which a pump photons splits into two or more photons into a single mode, the zero time-delay second-order correlation function of the down-converted field-mode is not proportional to that of the pump in the weak down-conversion limit. Nevertheless, we find it to be inversely proportional to the average number of photons in the pump field-mode.",20,[],6

We consider entanglement that arises due to the coupling of these degrees of freedom induced by Raman and radio-frequency fields and examine its dependence on the coupling parameters by evaluating von Neumann entropy as well as concurrence as measures of the entanglement attained.

The effect of local noises on the dynamical behaviors of quantum correlation is observed. We show the existence of specific and important features of MIN such as revival, noise robustness and sudden change with respect to decoherence parameter.

The main idea is to transform a basic measurement set in a way to provide a situation that is equivalent to measuring the maximally mixed state. As long as tomography of a fully mixed state has the fastest convergence comparing to other states, this method is expected to be highly accurate.

2009.05028,quant-ph,"The D-Wave quantum annealers make it possible to obtain high quality solutions of NP-hard problems by mapping a problem in a QUBO (quadratic unconstrained binary optimization) or Ising form to the physical qubit connectivity structure on the D-Wave chip. However, the latter is restricted in that only a fraction of all pairwise couplers between physical qubits exists. Modeling the connectivity structure of a given problem instance thus necessitates the computation of a minor embedding of the variables in the problem specification onto the logical qubits, which consist of several physical qubits ""chained"" together to act as a logical one. After annealing, it is however not guaranteed that all chained qubits get the same value (-1 or 1 for an Ising model, and 0 or 1 for a QUBO), and several approaches exist to assign a final value to each logical qubit (a process called ""unembedding""). In this work, we present tailored unembedding techniques for four important NP-hard problems: the Maximum Clique, Maximum Cut, Minimum Vertex Cover, and Graph Partitioning problems. Our techniques are simple and yet make use of structural properties of the problem being solved. Using Erd\Hos-R\'enyi random graphs as inputs, we compare our unembedding techniques to three popular ones (majority vote, random weighting, and minimize energy).

2003.05682,quant-ph,"Similarly to quantum states, quantum operations can also be transformed by means of quantum superchannels, also known as process matrices. Quantum superchannels with multiple slots are deterministic transformations which take causally independent quantum operations as inputs and are enforced to respect the laws of quantum mechanics but the use of input operations may lack a definite causal order. While causally ordered superchannels admit a characterization in terms of quantum circuits, a similar characterization of general superchannels in terms of standard quantum objects with a clearer physical interpretation has been missing. In this paper we provide a mathematical characterization for pure superchannels with two slots (also known as bipartite pure processes), which are superchannels preserving the reversibility of quantum operations. We show that the reversibility preserving condition restricts all pure superchannels with two slots to be either a causally ordered quantum circuit only consisting of unitary operations or a coherent superposition of two pure causally ordered circuits. The latter may be seen as a generalization of the quantum switch, allowing a physical interpretation for pure two-slot superchannels. An immediate corollary is that purifiable bipartite processes cannot violate device-independent causal inequalities.",20,[],6

We show that the response of the Szegedy walk to the input, which is the output, say equation, from the internal graph to the tails in the long time limit, is drastically changed depending on the reversibility of the underlying random walk. If the underlying random walk is reversible, we have equation, where the unitary matrix equation is the reflection matrix to the unit vector equation which is determined by the boundary of the internal graph equation. Then the global dynamics so that the internal graph is regarded as one vertex recovers the local dynamics of the Szegedy walk in the long time limit. Moreover if the underlying random walk of the Szegedy walk is reversible, then we obtain that the stationary state is expressed by a linear combination of the reversible measure and the electric current on the electric circuit determined by the internal graph and the random walk's reversible measure. On the other hand, if the underlying random walk is not reversible, then the unitary matrix is just a phase flip; that is, equation, and the stationary state is similar to the current flow but satisfies a different type of the Kirchhoff laws.",20,[],6

We then focus on the CS-QKD protocol with heterodyne detection in the pragmatic setting of finite keys, where complete security against general attacks is known. We pay particular attention to the relevant noise terms in the satellite-to-Earth channel and their impact on the secret key rates. In system set-ups where diffraction dominates losses, we find that the main components of the total excess noise are the intensity fluctuations due to scintillation, and the time-of-arrival fluctuations between signal and local oscillator. We conclude that for a wide range of pragmatic system models, CS-QKD with information-theoretic security in the satellite-to-Earth channel is feasible.",20,[],6
2004.05831,quant-ph,"Quantum phase estimation protocols can provide a measuring method of phase shift with precision superior to standard quantum limit (SQL) due to the application of a nonclassical state of light. A squeezed vacuum state, whose variance in one quadrature is lower than the corresponding SQL, has been pointed out a sensitive resource for quantum phase estimation and the estimation accuracy is directly influenced by the properties of the squeezed state. Here we detailedly analyze the influence of the purity and squeezing level of the squeezed state on the accuracy of quantum phase estimation. The maximum precision that can be achieved for a squeezed thermal state is evaluated, and the experimental results are in agreement with the theoretical analyses. It is also found that the width of the phase estimation interval equation beyond SQL is correlated with the purity of the squeezed state.",20,[],6
2007.07522,quant-ph,"The prototype of a quantum random number generator is a single photon which impinges onto a beam splitter and is then detected by single photon detectors at one of the two output paths. Prior to detection, the photon is in a quantum mechanical superposition state of the two possible outcomes with - ideally - equal amplitudes until its position is determined by measurement. When the two output modes are observed by a single photon detector, the generated clicks can be interpreted as ones and zeros - and a raw random bit stream is obtained. Here we implement such a random bit generator based on single photons from a defect center in diamond. We investigate the single photon emission of the defect center by an anti-bunching measurement. This certifies the ""quantumness"" of the supplied photonic input state, while the random ""decision"" is still based on the vacuum fluctuations at the open port of the beam-splitter. Technical limitations, such as intensity fluctuations, mechanical drift, and bias are discussed. A number of ways to suppress such unwanted effects, and an a priori entropy estimation are presented. The single photon nature allows for a characterization of the non-classicality of the source, and allows to determine a background fraction. Due to the NV-center's superior stability and optical properties, we can operate the generator under ambient conditions around the clock. We present a true 24/7 operation of the implemented random bit generator.",20,[],6
2011.08213,quant-ph,"With gate error rates in multiple technologies now below the threshold required for fault-tolerant quantum computation, the major remaining obstacle to useful quantum computation is scaling, a challenge greatly amplified by the huge overhead imposed by quantum error correction itself. We propose a fault-tolerant quantum computing scheme that can nonetheless be assembled from a small number of experimental components, potentially dramatically reducing the engineering challenges associated with building a large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer. Our scheme has a threshold of 0.39% for depolarising noise, assuming that memory errors are negligible. In the presence of memory errors, the logical error rate decays exponentially with equation, where equation is the memory coherence time and equation is the timescale for elementary gates. Our approach is based on a novel procedure for fault-tolerantly preparing three-dimensional cluster states using a single actively controlled qubit and a pair of delay lines. Although a circuit-level error may propagate to a high-weight error, the effect of this error on the prepared state is always equivalent to that of a constant-weight error. We describe how the requisite gates can be implemented using existing technologies in quantum photonic and phononic systems. With continued improvements in only a few components, we expect these systems to be promising candidates for demonstrating fault-tolerant quantum computation with a comparatively modest experimental effort.",20,[],6
2008.03083,quant-ph,"We set up differential phase shift quantum key distribution (DPS-QKD), over 105 km of single-mode optical fiber, with a quantum bit error rate of less than 15% at a secure key rate of 2 kbps. The testbed was first used to investigate the effect of excess bias voltage and hold-off time on the temporal distribution of photons within a gate window of an InGaAs single-photon detector (SPD) and quantified the effects of afterpulsing. The key generation efficiency, and security, in DPS-QKDimprove with an increase in the number of path delays or time-bin superpositions. We finally demonstrate the implementation of superposition states using a time-bin approach, and establish equivalence with the path-based superposition approach, thus yielding a simpler approach to implementing superposition states for use in DPS-QKD.",20,[],6
2009.07851,quant-ph,"We show that a variant of the surface code---the XZZX code---offers remarkable performance for fault-tolerant quantum computation. The error threshold of this code matches what can be achieved with random codes (hashing) for every single-qubit Pauli noise channel; it is the first explicit code shown to have this universal property. We present numerical evidence that the threshold even exceeds this hashing bound for an experimentally relevant range of noise parameters. Focusing on the common situation where qubit dephasing is the dominant noise, we show that this code has a practical, high-performance decoder and surpasses all previously known thresholds in the realistic setting where syndrome measurements are unreliable. We go on to demonstrate the favorable sub-threshold resource scaling that can be obtained by specializing a code to exploit structure in the noise. We show that it is possible to maintain all of these advantages when we perform fault-tolerant quantum computation. We finally suggest some small-scale experiments that could exploit noise bias to reduce qubit overhead in two-dimensional architectures.",20,[],6
2003.01166,quant-ph,"Spatially resolving two incoherent point sources whose separation is well below the diffraction limit dictated by classical optics has recently been shown possible using techniques that decompose the incoming radiation into orthogonal transverse modes. Such a demultiplexing procedure, however, must be perfectly calibrated to the transverse profile of the incoming light as any misalignment of the modes effectively restores the diffraction limit for small source separations. We study by how much can one mitigate such an effect at the level of measurement which, after being imperfectly demultiplexed due to inevitable misalignment, may still be partially corrected by linearly transforming the relevant dominating transverse modes. We consider two complementary tasks: the estimation of the separation between the two sources and the discrimination between one versus two incoherent point sources. We show that, although one cannot fully restore the super-resolving powers even when the value of the misalignment is perfectly known, its negative impact on the ultimate sensitivity can be significantly reduced.",20,[],6
2007.04591,quant-ph,"Exceptional points, the spectral degeneracy points in the complex parameter space, are fundamental to non-Hermitian quantum systems. The dynamics of non-Hermitian systems in the presence of exceptional points differ significantly from those of Hermitian ones. Here we investigate non-adiabatic transitions in non-Hermitian equation-symmetric systems, in which the exceptional points are driven through at finite speed which are quadratic or cubic functions of time. We identity different transmission dynamics separated by exceptional points, and derive analytical approximate formulas for the non-adiabatic transmission probabilities. We discuss possible experimental realizations with a equation-symmetric non-Hermitian one-dimensional tight-binding optical waveguide lattice.",20,[],6
2006.13180,quant-ph,"A novel and readily understandable derivation of the Golden Rule of time dependent perturbation theory is presented. The derivation is based on adiabatic turning on of the perturbation as used, for instance, in some formal developments of scattering theory. Energy conservation is expressed in terms of an intuitively and physically appealing Lorentzian line shape rather than the artificial, oscillatory sin(x)=x type line shape that appears in conventional derivations. The conditions for the derivation's validity are compactly and conveniently expressed in the frequency/energy domain rather than in the usual time domain. The derivation also highlights how, along with energy conservation, the transition rate faithfully and instantaneously follows the variations in the square of the perturbing potential as one may expect in the adiabatic limit. In the first instance, the adiabatic turning on is achieved, as usual, by a single exponential time variation. But we demonstrate that the instantaneous following of the square of the perturbing potential by the transition rate is more general and that one can derive the Golden Rule for a general slowly varying time dependent perturbation. This allows one to derive generalisations of the simple decay law, originally derived in the classic paper by Weisskopf and Wigner; a tutorial exposition of the essence of this classic work is provided. The Oppenheimer method for applying the Golden rule to problems, such as the electric field ionisation of atoms, in which the perturbing potential can also create the final states, is reviewed. No use of an energy gap condition is needed to derive our results on adiabatic behaviour in contrast to the origianl derivations of the adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics.",20,[],6
2009.12449,quant-ph,"Within the one-excitation context of two identical two-level atoms interacting with a common cavity, we examine the dynamics of all bipartite one-to-other entanglements between each qubit and the remaining part of the whole system. We find a new non-analytic ""sudden"" dynamical behavior of entanglement. Specifically, the sum of the three one-to-other entanglements of the system can be suddenly frozen at its maximal value or can be suddenly thawed from this value in a periodic manner. We calculate the onset timing of sudden freezing and sudden thawing under several different initial conditions. The phenomenon of permanent freezing for entanglement is also found. We also identify a non-trivial upper limit for the sum of three individual entanglements, which exposes the concept of entanglement sharing in a shrunken ""volume"". Further analyses about freezing and thawing processes reveal quantitative and qualitative laws of entanglement sharing.",20,[],6
2003.09846,quant-ph,"Mossbauer nuclei feature exceptionally narrow resonances at hard x-ray energies, which render them ideal probes for structure and dynamics in condensed-matter systems, and a promising platform for x-ray quantum optics and fundamental tests. However, a direct spectroscopy at modern x-ray sources such as synchrotrons or x-ray free electron lasers is challenging, because of the broad spectral bandwidth of the delivered x-ray pulses, and because of a limited spectral resolution offered by x-ray optics and detectors. To overcome these challenges, here, we propose a spectroscopy technique based on a spectrally narrow reference absorber that is rapidly oscillating along the propagation direction of the x-ray light. The motion induces sidebands to the response of the absorber, which we scan across the spectrum of the unknown target to gain spectral information. The oscillation further introduces a dependence of the detected light on the motional phase at the time of x-ray excitation as an additional controllable degree of freedom. We show how a Fourier analysis with respect to this phase enables one to selectively extract parts of the recorded intensity after the actual experiment, throughout the data analysis. This allows one to improve the spectral recovery by removing unwanted signal contributions. Our method is capable of gaining spectral information from the entire measured intensity, and not only from the intensity at late times after the excitation, such that a significantly higher part of the signal photons can be used. Furthermore, it not only enables one to measure the amplitude of the spectral response, but also its phase.",20,[],6
2008.07483,quant-ph,"Single-photon pulses cannot be generated on demand, due to incompatible requirements of positive frequencies and positive times. Resulting states therefore contain small probabilities for multiphotons. We derive upper and lower bounds for the maximum fidelity of realizable states that approximate single-photon pulses. The bounds have implications for ultrafast optics; the maximum fidelity is low for pulses with few cycles or close to the onset, but increases rapidly as the pulse envelope varies more slowly. We also demonstrate strictly localized states that are close to single photons.",20,[],6
2009.09979,quant-ph,"We review recent results on the low-temperature behaviors of the Casimir-Polder and Casimir free energy an entropy for a polarizable atom interacting with a graphene sheet and for two graphene sheets, respectively. These results are discussed in the wide context of problems arising in the Lifshitz theory of van der Waals and Casimir forces when it is applied to metallic and dielectric bodies. After a brief treatment of different approaches to theoretical description of the electromagnetic response of graphene, we concentrate on the derivation of response function in the framework of thermal quantum field theory in the Matsubara formulation using the polarization tensor in (21)-dimensional space-time. The asymptotic expressions for the Casimir-Polder and Casimir free energy and entropy at low temperature, obtained with the polarization tensor, are presented for a pristine graphene as well as for graphene sheets possessing some nonzero energy gap equation and chemical potential equation under different relationships between the values of equation and equation. Along with reviewing the results obtained in the literature, we present some new findings concerning the case of zero gap and nonzero chemical potential. The conclusion is made that the Lifshitz theory of the Casimir and Casimir-Polder forces in graphene systems using the quantum field theoretical description of a pristine graphene, as well as real graphene sheets with equation or equation, is consistent with the requirements of thermodynamics. The case of graphene with equation leads to an entropic anomaly, but is argued to be physically unrealistic. The way to a resolution of thermodynamic problems in the Lifshitz theory based on the results obtained for graphene is discussed.",20,[],6
2002.06733,quant-ph,"We investigate the quantum-secure covert-communication capabilities of lossy thermal-noise bosonic channels, the quantum-mechanical model for many practical channels. We determine the expressions for the covert capacity of these channels: equation, when Alice and Bob share only a classical secret, and equation, when they benefit from entanglement assistance. We find that entanglement assistance alters the fundamental scaling law for covert communication. Instead of equation, equation, entanglement assistance allows equation, equation, covert bits to be transmitted reliably over equation channel uses.",20,[],6
2003.03755,quant-ph,"Coherent control of quantum dynamics is key to a multitude of fundamental studies and applications alike. In the visible or longer-wavelength domains, near-resonant light fields have become the primary tool to control electron dynamics. Recently, coherent control in the extreme-ultraviolet range was demonstrated, with timing stability of the applied light fields in the few-attosecond range. At hard x-ray energies, Mossbauer nuclei feature narrow nuclear resonances, and spectroscopy of these resonances is a widespread tool to study magnetic, structural and dynamical properties of matter. It has been shown that the power and scope of Mossbauer spectroscopy can be significantly advanced using various control techniques. However, the coherent control of atomic nuclei using near-resonant x-ray fields remains an open challenge, also because of the extreme stability requirements on the x-ray light in the few-zeptosecond range. Here, we demonstrate such control, and use the relative phase of two x-ray pulses to switch the nuclear dynamics between stimulated emission and enhanced coherent excitation. For this, we suggest and implement a method to shape single pulses delivered by modern x-ray facilities into tunable double-pulses, with the desired stability on the few-zeptosecond level. Our results unlock coherent optical control for nuclei, and pave the way for nuclear Ramsey spectroscopy and spin-echo-like techniques, which not only provide key concepts for advancing nuclear quantum optics, but also essential ingredients for possible x-ray clocks and frequency standards. As a long-term perspective, we envision time-resolved studies of nuclear out-of-equilibrium dynamics, which is a long-standing open challenge in Mossbauer science.",20,[],6

2004.03105,quant-ph,"Quadrature correlations between subsystems of a Gaussian quantum state are fully characterised by its covariance matrix. For example, the covariance matrix determines the amount of entanglement or decoherence of the state. Here, we establish when it is possible to remove correlations between conjugate quadratures using only passive operations. Such correlations are usually undesired and arise due to experimental cross-quadrature contamination. Using the Autonne--Takagi factorisation, we present necessary and sufficient conditions to determine when such removal is possible. Our proof is constructive, and whenever it is possible we obtain an explicit expression for the required passive operation.",20,[],6

It has been shown that detailed balance in the form of fluctuation-dissipation relation preserves the dynamical stability of the attractors even in case of vacuum excitation.

Further the deletion machine can offer better fidelity of deletion than the Pati-Braunstein deletion machine for any input state with the right parameters.",20,[],6
2003.12551,quant-ph,"Heisenberg scaling precision for the estimation of any distributed parameter equation (not necessarily a phase) encoded into a generic equation-port linear network composed only of passive elements. The scheme proposed can be easily implemented from an experimental point of view since it employs only Gaussian states and Gaussian measurements. Due to the complete generality of the estimation problem considered, it was predicted that one would need to carry out an adaptive procedure which involves both the input states employed and the measurement performed at the output; we show that this is not necessary: Heisenberg scaling precision is still achievable by only adapting a single stage. The non-adapted stage only affects the value of a pre-factor multiplying the Heisenberg scaling precision: we show that, for large values of equation and a random choice of the non-adapted stage, this pre-factor takes a typical value which can be controlled through the encoding of the parameter equation into the linear network.",20,[],6

2002.10662,quant-ph,"To establish a time reference frame between two users in quantum key distribution, a synchronization calibration process is usually applied for the case of using gated mode single-photon detectors (SPDs). Traditionally, the synchronization calibration is independently implemented by the line length measurement for each SPD. However, this will leave a loophole which has been experimentally demonstrated by a special attack. Here, we propose an alternative synchronization scheme by fixing the relative delay of the signal time window among all SPDs and jointly performing the line length measurement with multiple SPDs under combining low-precision with high-precision synchronization. The new scheme is not only immune to the vulnerability but also improves the synchronization time from usually a few seconds to tens of milliseconds.",20,[],6
2006.01972,quant-ph,"We develop a quantum optical formalism to treat a two-dimensional array of atoms placed in an optical cavity. Importantly, and in contrast to typical treatments, we account for cooperative dipole-dipole effects mediated by the interaction of the atoms with the outside, non-cavity-confined modes. Based on the observation that scattering to these modes is largely inhibited due to these cooperative effects, we construct a generic formalism, independent of the specific cavity structure, and apply it to an array of non-saturated atoms. By further considering the atomic motion, we show that the inhibited damping can lead to a favorable scaling of the optomechanical parameters of an atom-array membrane placed within a cavity. The developed formalism lays the basis for further investigation of many-body QED with atom arrays in transversely confined geometries.",20,[],6
