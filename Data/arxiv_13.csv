1309.3401,astro-ph,Solar flares are one of the main forces behind space weather events. However the mechanism that drives such energetic phenomena is not fully understood. The standard eruptive flare model predicts that magnetic reconnection occurs high in the corona where hot fast flows are created. Some imaging or spectroscopic observations have indicated the presence of these hot fast flows but there have been no spectroscopic scanning observation to date to measure the two-dimensional structure quantitatively. We analyzed a flare that occurred on the west solar limb on 27 January 2012 observed by the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) and found that the hot (~30MK) fast (>500 km/s) component was located above the flare loop. This is consistent with magnetic reconnection taking place above the flare loop.,13,[],1
1310.7744,astro-ph,"The well known Jeans instability is studied for a viscoelastic, gravitational fluid using generalized hydrodynamic equations of motions. It is found that the threshold for the onset of instability appears at higher wavelengths in a viscoelastic medium. Elastic effects playing a role similar to thermal pressure are found to lower the growth rate of the gravitational instability. Such features may manifest themselves in matter constituting dense astrophysical objects.",13,[],1
1309.3857,astro-ph,"Optically thick energy dominated plasma created in the source of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) expands radially with acceleration and forms a shell with constant width measured in the laboratory frame. When strong Lorentz factor gradients are present within the shell it is supposed to spread at sufficiently large radii. There are two possible mechanisms of spreading: hydrodynamical and thermal ones. We consider both mechanisms evaluating the amount of spreading that occurs during expansion up to the moment when the expanding shell becomes transparent for photons. We compute the hydrodynamical spreading of an ultrarelativistically expanding shell. In the case of thermal spreading we compute the velocity spread as a function of two parameters: comoving temperature and bulk Lorentz factor of relativistic Maxwellian distribution. Based on this result we determine the value of thermal spreading of relativistically expanding shell. We found that thermal spreading is negligible for typical GRB parameters. Instead hydrodynamical spreading appears to be significant, with the shell width reaching equation cm for total energy equation erg and baryonic loading equation. Within the fireshell model such spreading will result in the duration of Proper Gamma-Ray Bursts up to several seconds.",13,[],1
1311.5737,astro-ph,"Atmospheric modeling is used to build synthetic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for the individual components of the speckle interferometric binary system HD375. These synthetic SEDs are combined together for the entire system and compared with its observational SED in an iterated procedure to achieve the best fit. Kurucz blanketed models with the measurements of magnitude differences were used to build these SED's. The input physical elements for building these best fitted synthetic SEDs represent adequately enough the elements of the system. These elements are: equation\,K, equation\,K, log equation, log equation, equation, equation equation, equation, equation and equation depending on new estimated parallax equation mas. A modified orbit of the system is built and compared with earlier orbits and the masses of the two components are calculated as equation and equation. Depending on the estimated physical and geometrical elements of the system, which are assured by synthetic photometry, we suggest that the two components are evolved subgiant (F8.5 IV & G0 IV) stars with age of 3.5 Gy formed by fragmentation.",13,[],1
1306.0598,astro-ph,"We describe the results of a search for early-type stars associated with the Taurus-Auriga molecular cloud complex, a diffuse nearby star-forming region noted as lacking young stars of intermediate and high mass. We investigate several sets of possible O, B and early A spectral class members. The first is a group of stars for which mid-infrared images show bright nebulae, all of which can be associated with stars of spectral type B. The second group consists of early-type stars compiled from (i) literature listings in SIMBAD; (ii) B stars with infrared excesses selected from the Spitzer Space Telescope survey of the Taurus cloud; (iii) magnitude- and color-selected point sources from the 2MASS; and (iv) spectroscopically identified early-type stars from the SDSS coverage of the Taurus region. We evaluated stars for membership in the Taurus-Auriga star formation region based on criteria involving: spectroscopic and parallactic distances, proper motions and radial velocities, and infrared excesses or line emission indicative of stellar youth. For selected objects, we also model the scattered and emitted radiation from reflection nebulosity and compare the results with the observed spectral energy distributions to further test the plausibility of physical association of the B stars with the Taurus cloud. This investigation newly identifies as probable Taurus members three B-type stars: HR 1445 (HD 28929), tau Tau (HD 29763), 72 Tau (HD 28149), and two A-type stars: HD 31305 and HD 26212, thus doubling the number of stars A5 or earlier associated with the Taurus clouds. Several additional early-type sources including HD 29659 and HD 283815 meet some, but not all, of the membership criteria and therefore are plausible, though not secure, members.",13,[],1
1305.5654,astro-ph,"The amplification and maintenance of the observed magnetic fields in the ICM are usually attributed to the turbulent dynamo action. This is generally derived employing a collisional MHD model. However, in the ICM the ion mean free path between collisions is of the order of the dynamical scales, thus requiring a collisionless MHD description. Unlike collisional MHD simulations, our study uses an anisotropic plasma pressure with respect to the direction of the local magnetic field, which brings the plasma within a parameter space where collisionless instabilities should take place. Within the adopted model these instabilities are contained at bay through the relaxation term of the pressure anisotropy which simulates the feedback of the mirror and firehose instabilities. This relaxation acts to get the plasma distribution function consistent with the empirical studies of collisionless plasmas. Our 3D numerical simulations of forced transonic turbulence motivated by modeling of the turbulent ICM are performed for different initial values of the magnetic field intensity, and different relaxation rates of the pressure anisotropy. We found that in the high beta plasma regime corresponding to the ICM conditions, a fast anisotropy relaxation rate gives results which are similar to the collisional-MHD model as far as the statistical properties of the turbulence are concerned. Also, the amplification of seed magnetic fields due to the turbulent dynamo action is similar to the collisional-MHD model. Our simulations that do not employ the anisotropy relaxation deviate significantly from the collisional-MHD results, and show more power at the small-scale fluctuations of both density and velocity representing the results of the instabilities. For these simulations the large scale fluctuations in the magnetic field are mostly suppressed and the turbulent dynamo fails in amplifying seed magnetic fields.",13,['physics'],1
1308.1549,astro-ph,"We compute the abundance gradients along the disk of the Milky Way by means of the two-infall model: in particular, the gradients of oxygen and iron and their temporal evolution. First, we explore the effects of several physical processes which influence the formation and evolution of abundance gradients. They are: i) the inside-out formation of the disk, ii) a threshold in the gas density for star formation, iii) a variable star formation efficiency along the disk, iv) radial flows and their speed, and v) different total surface mass density (gas plus stars) distributions for the halo. We are able to reproduce at best the present day gradients of oxygen and iron if we assume an inside-out formation, no threshold gas density, a constant efficiency of star formation along the disk and radial gas flows. It is particularly important the choice of the velocity pattern for radial flows and the combination of this velocity pattern with the surface mass density distribution in the halo. Having selected the best model, we then explore the evolution of abundance gradients in time and find that the gradients in general steepen in time and that at redshift z~3 there is a gradient inversion in the inner regions of the disk, in the sense that at early epochs the oxygen abundance decreases toward the Galactic center. This effect, which has been observed, is naturally produced by our models if an inside-out formation of the disk and and a constant star formation efficiency are assumed. The inversion is due to the fact that in the inside-out formation a strong infall of primordial gas, contrasting chemical enrichment, is present in the innermost disk regions at early times. The gradient inversion remains also in the presence of radial flows, either with constant or variable speed in time, and this is a new result.",13,[],1
1304.5965,astro-ph,"The stellar wind around the compact object in luminous wind-accreting high mass X-ray binaries is expected to be strongly ionized with the X-rays coming from the compact object. The stellar wind of hot stars is mostly driven by light absorption in lines of heavier elements, and X-ray photo-ionization significantly reduces the radiative force within the so-called Stroemgren region leading to wind stagnation around the compact object. In close binaries like Vela X-1 this effect might alter the wind structure throughout the system. Using the spectral data from Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI), we study the observed dependence of the photoelectric absorption as function of orbital phase in Vela X-1, and find that it is inconsistent with expectations for a spherically-symmetric smooth wind. Taking into account previous investigations we develop a simple model for wind structure with a stream-like photoionization wake region of slower and denser wind trailing the neutron star responsible for the observed absorption curve.",13,[],1
1310.8196,astro-ph,"We present a magnetic analysis of the formation and eruption of an active region (AR) sigmoid in AR 11283 from 2011 September 4 to 6. To follow the quasi-static evolution of the coronal magnetic field, we reconstruct a time sequence of static fields using a recently developed nonlinear force-free field model constrained by the SDO/HMI vector magnetograms. A detailed analysis of the fields compared with the SDO/AIA observations suggests the following scenario for the evolution of the region. Initially, a new bipole emerges into the negative polarity of a pre-existing bipolar AR, forming a null point topology between the two flux systems. A weakly twisted flux rope (FR) is then built up slowly in the embedded core region, largely through flux-cancellation photospheric reconnections, forming a bald patch separatrix surface (BPSS) separating the FR from its ambient field. The FR grows gradually until its axis runs into a torus instability (TI) domain near the end of the third day, and the BPSS also develops a fully S-shape. Unlike in the case of standard TI, the FR does not erupt instantly since it is still attached at the photosphere along the bald patch (BP) portion of the polarity inversion line. The combined effects of the TI-driven expansion of the FR and the line-tying at the BP tear the FR into two parts with the upper portion freely expelled and the lower portion remaining behind the post-flare arcades. This process dynamically perturbs the BPSS and results in the transient enhanced brightening of the sigmoid. The accelerated expansion of the upper portion of the FR strongly pushes its envelope flux near the null point and triggers breakout reconnection at the null, as evidenced by a remarkable circular flare ribbon, which further facilitates the eruption. We discuss the important implications of these results for the formation and disruption of sigmoid region with FR.",13,[],1
1303.1689,astro-ph,"In the applications of solar magneto-seismology(SMS), employing the ratio of the period of the fundamental mode to twice the one of its first overtone, equation, plays an important role. We examine how field-aligned flows affect the dispersion properties, and hence the period ratios, of standing modes supported by magnetic slabs in the solar atmosphere. We numerically solve the dispersion relations and devise a graphic means to construct standing modes. For coronal slabs, we find that the flow effects are significant, for the fast kink and sausage modes alike. For the kink ones, they may reduce equation by up to 23% compared with the static case, and the minimum allowed equation can fall below the lower limit analytically derived for static slabs. For the sausage modes, while introducing the flow reduces equation by typically equation % relative to the static case, it significantly increases the threshold aspect ratio only above which standing sausage modes can be supported, meaning that their detectability is restricted to even wider slabs. In the case of photospheric slabs, the flow effect is not as strong. However, standing modes are distinct from the coronal case in that standing kink modes show a equation that deviates from unity even for a zero-width slab, while standing sausage modes no longer suffer from a threshold aspect ratio. We conclude that transverse structuring in plasma density and flow speed should be considered in seismological applications of multiple periodicities to solar atmospheric structures.",13,[],1
1305.1510,astro-ph,"We perform numerical experiments to investigate the influence of inelastic neutrino reactions with light nuclei on the standing accretion shock instability (SASI). The time evolution of shock waves is calculated with a simple light-bulb approximation for the neutrino transport and a multi-nuclei equation of state. The neutrino absorptions and inelastic interactions with deuterons, tritons, helions and alpha particles are taken into account in the hydrodynamical simulations in addition to the ordinary charged-current interactions with nucleons. Axial symmetry is assumed but no equatorial symmetry is imposed. We show that the heating rates of deuterons reach as high as 10% of those of nucleons around the bottom of the gain region. On the other hand, alpha particles are heated near the shock wave, which is important when the shock wave expands and the density and temperature of matter become low. It is also found that the models with heating by light nuclei have different evolutions from those without it in the non-linear phase of SASI. This results is because matter in the gain region has a varying density and temperature and there appear sub-regions that are locally rich in deuterons and alpha particles. Although the light nuclei are never dominant heating sources and they work favorably for shock revival in some cases and unfavorably in other cases, they are non-negligible and warrant further investigation.",13,['nucl-th'],1
1305.6894,astro-ph,"Magnetars are neutron stars showing dramatic X-ray and soft equation-ray outbursting behaviour that is thought to be powered by intense internal magnetic fields. Like conventional young neutron stars in the form of radio pulsars, magnetars exhibit ""glitches"" during which angular momentum is believed to be transferred between the solid outer crust and the superfluid component of the inner crust. Hitherto, the several hundred observed glitches in radio pulsars and magnetars have involved a sudden spin-up of the star, due presumably to the interior superfluid rotating faster than the crust. Here we report on X-ray timing observations of the magnetar 1E 2259586 which we show exhibited a clear ""anti-glitch"" -- a sudden spin down. We show that this event, like some previous magnetar spin-up glitches, was accompanied by multiple X-ray radiative changes and a significant spin-down rate change. This event, if of origin internal to the star, is unpredicted in models of neutron star spin-down and is suggestive of differential rotation in the neutron star, further supporting the need for a rethinking of glitch theory for all neutron stars.",13,[],1
1302.6415,astro-ph,"Typically cold inflation with positive vacuum energy density dilutes all matter except the quan- tum fluctuations which are stretched outside the Hubble patch during inflation. However the cyclic- inflation scenario, where the universe undergoes many many asymmetric cycles leading to an overall exponential growth, operates in the presence of thermal matter. Thus, while some of the nice prop- erties of cold inflation is preserved, in cyclic inflationary models thermal excitations are continually produced and there exists a unique opportunity of imprinting interesting thermal history in CMBR. In particular, we will see that a phase transition can lead to observably large higher order nongaus- sianities as the critical temperature is approached, and that these are increasingly divergent with the order of the correlations.",13,"['gr-qc', 'hep-th']",1
1308.4977,astro-ph,"Large star-to-star variations of the abundances of proton-capture elements, such as Na and O, in globular clusters (GCs) are interpreted as the effect of internal pollution resulting from the presence of multiple stellar populations. To better constrain this scenario we investigate the abundance distribution of the heavy element rubidium (Rb) in NGC 6752, NGC 1904, and NGC 104 (47 Tuc). Combining the results from our sample with those in the literature, we found that Rb exhibits no star-to-star variations, regardless the cluster metallicity, with the possible intriguing, though very uncertain, exception of the metal-rich bulge cluster NGC 6388. If no star-to-star variations will be confirmed for all GCs, it implies that the stellar source of the proton-capture element variations must not have produced significant amounts of Rb. This element is observed to be enhanced at extremely high levels in intermediate-mass AGB (IM-AGB) stars in the Magellanic Clouds (i.e., at a metallicity similar to 47 Tuc and NGC 6388). This may present a challenge to this popular candidate polluter, unless the mass range of the observed IM-AGB stars does not participate in the formation of the second-generation stars in GCs. A number of possible solutions are available to resolve this conundrum, also given that the Magellanic Clouds observations are very uncertain and may need to be revised. The fast rotating massive stars scenario would not face this potential problem as the slow mechanical winds of these stars during their main-sequence phase do not carry any Rb enhancements; however, these candidates face even bigger issues such as the production of Li and the close over-imposition with core-collapse supernova timescales. Observations of Sr, Rb, and Zr in metal-rich clusters such as NGC 6388 and NGC 6441 are sorely needed to clarify the situation.",13,[],1
1311.6467,astro-ph,"Images taken with modern detectors require calibration via flat fielding to obtain the same flux scale across the whole image. One method for obtaining the best possible flat fielding accuracy is to derive a photometric model from dithered stellar observations. A large variety of effects have been taken into account in such modelling. Recently, Moehler et al. (2010) discovered systematic variations in available flat frames for the European Southern Observatory's FORS instrument that change with the orientation of the projected image on the sky. The effect on photometry is large compared to other systematic effects that have already been taken into account. In this paper, we present a correction method for this effect: a generalization of the fitting procedure of Bramich & Freudling (2012) to include a polynomial representation of rotating flat fields. We then applied the method to the specific case of FORS2 photometric observations of a series of standard star fields, and provide parametrised solutions that can be applied by the users. We found polynomial coefficients to describe the static and rotating large-scale systematic flat-field variations across the FORS2 field of view. Applying these coefficients to FORS2 data, the systematic changes in the flux scale across FORS2 images can be improved by ~1% to ~2% of the total flux. This represents a significant improvement in the era of large-scale surveys, which require homogeneous photometry at the 1% level or better.",13,[],1
1310.1099,astro-ph,"Galactic superwinds may be driven by very hot outflows generated by overlapping supernovae within the host galaxy. We use the Chevalier & Clegg (CC85) wind model and the observed correlation between X-ray luminosities of galaxies and their SFRs to constrain the mass loss rates (\dotMhot) across a wide range of star formation rates (SFRs), from dwarf starbursts to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies. We show that for fixed thermalization efficiency and mass loading rate, the X-ray luminosity of the hot wind scales as LX ~ SFR2, significantly steeper than is observed for star-forming galaxies: LX ~ SFR. Using this difference we constrain the mass-loading and thermalization efficiency of hot galactic winds. For reasonable values of the thermalization efficiency (<~ 1) and for SFR >~ 10 Msun/yr we find that \dotMhot/SFR <~ 1, significantly lower than required by integrated constraints on the efficiency of stellar feedback in galaxies, and potentially too low to explain observations of winds from rapidly star-forming galaxies. In addition, we highlight the fact that heavily mass-loaded winds cannot be described by the adiabatic CC85 model because they become strongly radiative.",13,[],1
1311.3856,astro-ph,"Recently, the Planck satellite found a larger and most precise value of the matter energy density, that impacts on the present values of other cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant, the present cluster abundances and the age of the Universe. The existing tension between Planck determination of these parameters in the frame of the base LambdaCDM model and their direct measurements generated lively discussions and several interpretations. In this paper we quantify this tension by exploring several extensions of the base LambdaCDM model that include the leptonic asymmetry. We set bounds on the radiation content of the Universe and neutrino properties by using the latest cosmological measurements, imposing also self-consistent BBN constraints on the primordial helium abundance. For all cosmological asymmetric models we find the preference of cosmological data for smaller values of active and sterile neutrino masses. This increases the tension between cosmological and short baseline neutrino oscillation data that favor a sterile neutrino with the mass of around 1 eV. For the case of degenerate massive neutrinos, we find that the discrepancies with direct determinations of the Hubble constant, the present cluster abundances and the age of the Universe are alleviated at ~ 1.3 sigma for all leptonic asymmetric models. We also find ~2 sigma statistical evidence of the preference of cosmological data for the normal neutrino hierarchy. This is more evident for the case of cosmological models involving leptonic asymmetry and three massive neutrino species. We conclude that the current cosmological data favor the leptonic asymmetric extension of the base LambdaCDM model and normal neutrino mass hierarchy over the models with additional sterile neutrino species and/or inverted neutrino mass hierarchy.",13,['hep-ph'],1
1303.6279,astro-ph,"I discuss the possibility that accreting supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries with sub-parsec separations produce periodically recurring luminous outbursts that interrupt periods of relative quiescence. This hypothesis is motivated by two characteristics found generically in simulations of binaries embedded in prograde accretion discs: (i) the formation of a central, low-density cavity around the binary, and (ii) the leakage of gas into this cavity, occurring once per orbit via discrete streams on nearly radial trajectories. The first feature would reduce the emergent optical/UV flux of the system relative to active galactic nuclei powered by single SMBHs, while the second can trigger quasiperiodic fluctuations in luminosity. I argue that the quasiperiodic accretion signature may be much more dramatic than previously thought, because the infalling gas streams can strongly shock-heat via self-collision and tidal compression, thereby enhancing viscous accretion. Any optically thick gas that is circularized about either SMBH can accrete before the next pair of streams is deposited, fueling transient, luminous flares that recur every orbit. Due to the diminished flux in between accretion episodes, such cavity-accretion flares could plausibly be mistaken for the tidal disruptions of stars in quiescent nuclei. The flares could be distinguished from tidal disruption events if their quasiperiodic recurrence is observed, or if they are produced by very massive SMBHs that cannot disrupt solar-type stars. They may be discovered serendipitously in surveys such as LSST or eROSITA. I present a heuristic toy model as a proof of concept for the production of cavity-accretion flares, and generate mock light curves and specta. I also apply the model to the active galaxy OJ 287, whose production of quasiperiodic pairs of optical flares has long fueled speculation that it hosts a SMBH binary.",13,[],1
1303.5174,astro-ph,"We present three-dimensional hybrid simulations of collisionless shocks that propagate parallel to the background magnetic field to study the acceleration of protons that forms a high-energy tail on the distribution. We focus on the initial acceleration of thermal protons and compare it with results from one-dimensional simulations. We find that for both one- and three-dimensional simulations, particles that end up in the high-energy tail of the distribution later in the simulation gained their initial energy right at the shock. This confirms previous results but is the first to demonstrate this using fully three-dimensional fields. The result is not consistent with the ""thermal leakage"" model. We also show that the gyrocenters of protons in the three-dimensional simulation can drift away from the magnetic field lines on which they started due to the removal of ignorable coordinates that exist in one- and two-dimensional simulations. Our study clarifies the injection problem for diffusive shock acceleration.",13,['physics'],1

While temperature and surface-brightness jumps have been detected and measured in many systems, a detailed characterization of the metal abundance across the discontinuity is only available for a handful of objects. Within the sloshing scenario, we expect the central cool and metal rich gas to be displaced outwards into lower abundance regions, thus generating a metal discontinuity across the front. We analyzed a long (120 ksec) XMM-Newton observation of A496 to study the metal distribution and its correlation with the cold-fronts. We find Fe discontinuities across the two main cold-fronts located ~60 kpc NNW and ~160 kpc South of the peak and a metal excess in the South direction.",13,[],1

1312.5446,astro-ph,"The dust-HI correlation is used to characterize the emission properties of dust in the diffuse interstellar medium. We cross-correlate sky maps from Planck, WMAP, and DIRBE, at 17 frequencies from 23 to 3000 GHz, with the Parkes survey of the 21-cm line emission of neutral atomic hydrogen, over a contiguous area of 7500 degequation centred on the southern Galactic pole. Our analysis yields four specific results. (1) The dust temperature is observed to be anti-correlated with the dust emissivity and opacity. We interpret this result as evidence for dust evolution within the diffuse ISM. The mean dust opacity is measured to be equation for equationGHz. (2) We map the spectral index of dust emission at millimetre wavelengths, which is remarkably constant at equation. We compare it with the far infrared spectral index betaFIR derived from greybody fits at higher frequencies, and find a systematic difference, equation, which suggests that the dust SED flattens at equationGHz. (3) We present spectral fits of the microwave emission correlated with HI from 23 to 353 GHz, which separate dust and anomalous microwave emission. The flattening of the dust SED can be accounted for with an additional component with a blackbody spectrum, which accounts for equation% of the dust emission at 100 GHz and could represent magnetic dipole emission. Alternatively, it could account for an increasing contribution of carbon dust, or a flattening of the emissivity of amorphous silicates, at millimetre wavelengths. These interpretations make different predictions for the dust polarization SED.

1310.2253,astro-ph,"We present a budget and accounting of metals in and around star-forming galaxies at equation. We combine empirically derived star formation histories with updated supernova and AGB yields and rates to estimate the total mass of metals produced by galaxies with present-day stellar mass of equation--equation. On the accounting side of the ledger, we show that a surprisingly constant 20--25% mass fraction of produced metals remain in galaxies' stars, interstellar gas and interstellar dust, with little dependence of this fraction on the galaxy stellar mass (omitting those metals immediately locked up in remnants). Thus, the bulk of metals are outside of galaxies, produced in the progenitors of today's equation galaxies. The COS-Halos survey is uniquely able to measure the mass of metals in the circumgalactic medium (to impact parameters of equation kpc) of low-redshift equation galaxies. Using these data, we map the distribution of CGM metals as traced by both the highly ionized OVI ion and a suite of low-ionization species; combined with constraints on circumgalactic dust and hotter X-ray emitting gas out to similar impact parameters, we show that equation% of metals produced by equation galaxies can be easily accounted for out to 150 kpc.

1310.2211,astro-ph,"We perform global three-dimensional (3D) radiation-hydrodynamics calculations of the envelopes surrounding young planetary cores of 5, 10, and 15 Earth masses, located in a protoplanetary disk at 5 and 10 AU from a solar-mass star. We apply a nested-grid technique to resolve the thermodynamics of the disk at the orbital-radius length scale and that of the envelope at the core-radius length scale. The gas is modeled as a solar mixture of molecular and atomic hydrogen, helium, and their ions. The equation of state accounts for both gas and radiation, and gas energy includes contributions from rotational and vibrational states of molecular hydrogen and from ionization of atomic species. Dust opacities are computed from first principles, applying the full Mie theory. One-dimensional (1D) calculations of planet formation are used to supplement the 3D calculations by providing energy deposition rates in the envelope due to solids accretion. We compare 1D and 3D envelopes and find that masses and gas accretion rates agree within factors of 2, and so do envelope temperatures. The trajectories of passive tracers are used to define the size of 3D envelopes, resulting in radii much smaller than the Hill radius and smaller than the Bondi radius. The moments of inertia and angular momentum of the envelopes are determined and the rotation rates are derived from the rigid-body approximation, resulting in slow bulk rotation. We find that the polar flattening is < ~0.05. The dynamics of the accretion flow is examined by tracking the motion of tracers that move into the envelope. The anisotropy of this flow is characterized in terms of both its origin and impact site at the envelope surface. Gas merges with the envelope preferentially at mid- to high latitudes.",13,[],1

We found a standard luminosity light curve behavior in the late-time X-ray emission of this subclass of GRBs. We interpret this as the result of a common physical mechanism in this particular phase of the X-ray emission, possibly related to the creation of the NS from the SN process.

1302.7284,astro-ph,"Blue straggler stars (BSS) are abundantly observed in all Galactic globular clusters (GGC) where data exist. However, observations alone cannot reveal the relative importance of various formation channels or the typical formation times for this well studied population of anomalous stars. Using a state-of-the-art H\'enon-type Monte Carlo code that includes all relevant physical processes, we create 128 models with properties typical of the observed GGCs. These models include realistic numbers of single and binary stars, use observationally motivated initial conditions, and span large ranges in central density, concentration, binary fraction, and mass. Their properties can be directly compared with those of observed GGCs. We can easily identify the BSSs in our models and determine their formation channels and birth times. We find that for central densities above ~103 Msun/pc3 the dominant formation channel is stellar collisions while for lower density clusters, mass transfer in binaries provides a significant contribution (up to ~ 60% in our models). The majority of these collisions are binary-mediated, occurring during 3-body and 4-body interactions. As a result a strong correlation between the specific frequency of BSSs and the binary fraction in a cluster can be seen in our models. We find that the number of BSSs in the core shows only a weak correlation with the collision rate estimator letter traditionally used by observers, in agreement with the latest Hubble Space Telescope (ACS) data. Using an idealized ""full mixing"" prescription for collision products, our models indicate that the BSSs observed today may have formed several Gyrs ago.

After subtraction of point sources, we reach a median (best) 1-sigma noise level of 0.01 (0.006) microJy/sq. arcsec, and find a significant excess of diffuse, low surface brightness emission in 11 of 12 clusters. We present initial 1.4 GHz Very Large Array results on Abell 2319. We find: (a) four new detections tentatively classified as two halos (A2065, A2069) and two relics (A2067, A2073); (b) the first detection of the radio halo in A2061 at 1.4 GHz, making it a possible ultra-steep spectrum halo (alpha ~ 1.8); (c) a ~2 Mpc radio halo in the sloshing, minor-merger cluster A2142; (d) a >2x increase of the giant radio halo extent and luminosity in A2319; (e) a ~7x increase to the integrated radio flux and >4x increase to the observed extent of the peripheral, polarized radio relic in A1367 to ~600 kpc; (f) significant excess emission of ambiguous nature in three clusters. Our radio halo detections agree with the well-known X-ray/radio luminosity correlation, but are larger and fainter than expected. The volume averaged synchrotron emissivities are 1-2 orders of magnitude below the previous characteristic values. Some of the halo-like detections may represent previously unseen, very low surface brightness emission or blends of shock structures and sub-Mpc scale turbulent regions. Four of the five tentative halos contain one or more X-ray cold fronts, suggesting a possible connection between gas sloshing and particle acceleration on large scales. We see evidence for a possible inter-cluster filament between A2061 and A2067. For our faintest detections, we note the possibility of residual contamination from faint radio galaxies. We also quantify the sensitivity of the NVSS to extended emission as a function of angular size.[abridged]",13,[],1

1307.4014,astro-ph,"The infrared (IR) spectra of many evolved carbon-rich stars exhibit two prominent dust emission features peaking around 21um and 30um, with the former exclusively seen in proto-planetary nebulae (PPNe), while the latter seen in a much wider range of objects, including AGB stars, PPNe and planetary nebulae (PNe). The 30um feature is seen in all the 21um sources, but no correlation is found between these two features. Over a dozen carrier candidates have been proposed for the 21um feature, but none of them has been widely accepted and the nature of the 21um feature remains a mystery. The carrier of the 30um feature also remains unidentied. MgS dust, once widely accepted as a valid carrier, was ruled out because of the sulfur budget problem. In this work we examine nano-sized FeO dust as a carrier for the 21um feature. We calculate the IR emission spectrum of FeO nanodust which undergoes single-photon heating in PPNe. It is found that the 21um feature emitted by FeO nanodust is too broad to explain the observed feature. For the 30um feature, we argue that graphite could be a viable carrier. Graphite, provided its d.c. conductivity sigmadc exceeding 100/ohm/cm, exhibits a pronounced band at 30um.",13,[],1

It is known that there are two-types of the CMB distortions, so-called letter- and y-types and we find that the signal of the y-type distortion becomes larger than that of the letter-type one. We also discuss cross power spectra between the CMB distortions and the CMB temperature anisotropy, which are naturally generated due to the existence of the primordial magnetic fields. We find that such cross power spectra have small amplitudes compared with the auto-power spectra of the CMB distortions because of the Silk damping effect of the temperature anisotropy.

1310.1399,astro-ph,"We present a detailed spectral analysis of new XMM-Newton data of the source CXOC J100043.1020637, also known as CID-42, detected in the COSMOS survey at z = 0.359. Previous works suggested that CID-42 is a candidate recoiling supermassive black holes showing also an inverted P-Cygni profile in the X- ray spectra at ~6 keV (rest) with an iron emission line plus a redshifted absorption line (detected at 3sigma in previous XMM-Newton and Chandra observations). Detailed analysis of the absorption line suggested the presence of ionized material inflowing into the black hole at high velocity. In the new long XMM-Newton observation, while the overall spectral shape remains constant, the continuum 2-10 keV flux decreased of ~20% with respect to previous observation and the absorption line is undetected. The upper limit on the intensity of the absorption line is EW<162 keV. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations show that the non detection of the line is solely due to variation in the properties of the inflowing material, in agreement with the transient nature of these features, and that the intensity of the line is lower than the previously measured with a probability of 98.8%. In the scenario of CID-42 as recoiling SMBH, the absorption line can be interpreted as due to inflow of gas with variable density and located in the proximity of the SMBH and recoiling with it. New monitoring observations will be requested to further characterize this line.",13,[],1
1302.0941,astro-ph,A single fluid approximation which treats perturbations in baryons and dark matter as equal has sometimes been used to calculate the growth of linear matter density perturbations in the Universe. We demonstrate that properly accounting for the separate growth of baryon and dark matter fluctuations can change some predictions of structure formation in the linear domain in a way that can alter conclusions about the consistency between predictions and observations for equationCDM models versus modified gravity scenarios . Our results may also be useful for 21cm tomography constraints on alternative cosmological models for the formation of large scale structure.,13,[],1
1312.4530,astro-ph,"We investigate the possibility of constraining coupled dark energy (cDE) cosmologies using the three-point correlation function (3PCF). Making use of the CoDECS N-body simulations, we study the statistical properties of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes for a variety of models, including a fiducial equationCDM scenario and five models in which dark energy (DE) and CDM mutually interact. We measure both the halo 3PCF, equation, and the reduced 3PCF, equation, at different scales (equationMpc\hequation) and redshifts (equation). In all cDE models considered in this work, equation appears flat at small scales (for all redshifts) and at low redshifts (for all scales), while it builds up the characteristic V-shape anisotropy at increasing redshifts and scales. With respect to the equationCDM predictions, cDE models show lower (higher) values of the halo 3PCF for perpendicular (elongated) configurations. The effect is also scale-dependent, with differences between equationCDM and cDE models that increase at large scales. We made use of these measurements to estimate the halo bias, that results in fair agreement with the one computed from the two-point correlation function (2PCF). The main advantage of using both the 2PCF and 3PCF is to break the biasequation degeneracy. Moreover, we find that our bias estimates are approximately independent of the assumed strength of DE coupling. This study demonstrates the power of a higher-order clustering analysis in discriminating between alternative cosmological scenarios, for both present and forthcoming galaxy surveys, such as e.g. BOSS and Euclid.",13,[],1
1310.4037,astro-ph,"We test the relativistic precession model (RPM) and the MHD Alfven wave oscillation model (AWOM) for the kHz QPOs by the sources with measured NS masses and twin kHz QPO frequencies. For RPM, the derived NS mass of Cyg X-2 (SAX J1808.4-3658 and 4U 1820-30) is 1.96 /- 0.10 solar masses (2.83 /- 0.04 solar masses and 1.85 /- 0.02 solar masses), which is 30% (100% and 40%) higher than the measured result 1.5 /- 0.3 solar masses (< 1.4 solar masses and 1.29  0.19 / - 0.07 solar masses). For AWOM, where the free parameter of model is the density of star, we infer the NS radii to be around 10 - 20 km for the above three sources, based on which we can infer the matter compositions inside NSs with the help of the equations of state (EOSs). In particular, for SAX J1808.4-3658, AWOM shows a lower mass density of its NS than those of the other known kHz QPO sources, with the radius range of 17 - 20 km, which excludes the strange quark matter inside its star.",13,[],1
1312.1438,astro-ph,"In this chapter, I present a summary of observational tests of the basic picture of disk accretion. An emphasis is placed on tests relevant to black holes, but many of the fundamental results are drawn from studies of other classes of systems. Evidence is discussed for the basic structures of accretion flows. The cases of systems with and without accretion disks are discussed, as is the evidence that disks actually form. Also discussed are the hot spots where accretion streams impact the disks, and the boundary layers in the inner parts of systems where the accretors are not black holes. The nature of slow, large amplitude variability is discussed. It is shown that some of the key predictions of the classical thermal-viscous ionization instability model for producing outbursts are in excellent agreement with observational results. It is also show that there are systems whose outbursts are extremely difficult to explain without invoking variations in the rate of mass transfer from the donor star into the outer accretion disk, or tidally induced variations in the mass transfer rates. Finally, I briefly discuss recent quasar microlensing measurements which give truly independent constraints on the inner accretion geometry around black holes.",13,[],1
1306.3520,astro-ph,"Recent X-ray observations of galaxy clusters have shown that there is substructure present in the intracluster medium (ICM), even in clusters that are seemingly relaxed. This substructure is sometimes a result of sloshing of the ICM, which occurs in cool core clusters that have been disturbed by an off-axis merger with a sub-cluster or group. We present deep Chandra observations of the cool core cluster Abell 2029, which has a sloshing spiral extending radially outward from the center of the cluster to approximately 400 kpc at its fullest extent---the largest continuous spiral observed to date. We find a surface brightness excess, a temperature decrement, a density enhancement, an elemental abundance enhancement, and a smooth pressure profile in the area of the spiral. The sloshing gas seems to be interacting with the southern lobe of the central radio galaxy, causing it to bend and giving the radio source a wide-angle tail (WAT) morphology. This shows that WATs can be produced in clusters that are relatively relaxed on large scales. We explore the interaction between heating and cooling in the central region of the cluster. Energy injection from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) is likely insufficient to offset the cooling, and sloshing may be an important additional mechanism in preventing large amounts of gas from cooling to very low temperatures.",13,[],1
1304.7428,astro-ph,"We present multi-epoch photometric and spectroscopic near-infrared observations of the Be star X Persei in the JHK bands covering the wavelength range 1.08 to 2.35 micron. Combining results from our earlier studies with the present observations, it is shown that the equivalent widths and line fluxes of the prominent HI and HeI lines anti-correlate with the strength of the adjacent continuum. That is, during the span of the observations, the JHK broad band fluxes increase while the emission equivalent width values of the HI and HeI lines decrease (the lines under consideration being the Paschen and Brackett lines of hydrogen and the 1.7002 micron and 2.058 micron lines of helium). Such an anti-correlation effect is not commonly observed in Be stars in the optical; in the infrared this may possibly be the first reported case of such behavior. We examine different mechanisms that could possibly cause it and suggest that it could originate due to a radiatively warped, precessing circumstellar disk.

However, we find that the dynamical perturbations induced by the Large Magellanic Cloud on the orbit of Sgr cannot be neglected when modeling its streams. When taken into account, this leads us to constrain the Galaxy's outer halo shape to have minor-to-major axis ratio (c/a)letter = 0.8 and intermediate-to-major axis ratio (b/a)letter = 0.9, in good agreement with cosmological expectations.",13,[],1
1306.4031,astro-ph,"We present the ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function of galaxies from the GALEX Medium Imaging Survey with measured spectroscopic redshifts from the first data release of the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. This sample selects galaxies with high star formation rates: at 0.6 < z < 0.9 the median star formation rate is at the upper 95th percentile of optically-selected (r<22.5) galaxies and the sample contains about 50 per cent of all NUV < 22.8, 0.6 < z < 0.9 starburst galaxies within the volume sampled.   The most luminous galaxies in our sample (-21.0>MNUV>-22.5) evolve very rapidly with a number density declining as (1z)5 1 from redshift z = 0.9 to z = 0.6. These starburst galaxies (MNUV<-21 is approximately a star formation rate of 30 \msuny) contribute about 1 per cent of cosmic star formation over the redshift range z=0.6 to z=0.9. The star formation rate density of these very luminous galaxies evolves rapidly, as (1z)4 1. Such a rapid evolution implies the majority of star formation in these large galaxies must have occurred before z = 0.9.   We measure the UV luminosity function in 0.05 redshift intervals spanning 0.1<z<0.9, and provide analytic fits to the results. At all redshifts greater than z=0.55 we find that the bright end of the luminosity function is not well described by a pure Schechter function due to an excess of very luminous (MNUV<-22) galaxies. These luminosity functions can be used to create a radial selection function for the WiggleZ survey or test models of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we test the AGN feedback model in Scannapieco et al.

The forming fragments span a mass range from about a Jupiter mass to very-low-mass protostars and are located at distances from a few tens to a thousand AU, with a dearth of objects at < 100 AU. We explore the possibility of observational detection of the fragments in discs viewed through the outflow cavity at a distance of 250 pc. We demonstrate that one hour of integration time with the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) is sufficient to detect the fragments with masses as low as 1.5 MJup at orbital distances up to 800 AU from the protostar. The ALMA resolution sets the limit on the minimum orbital distance of detectable fragments. For the adopted resolution of our simulated ALMA images of 0.1"", the fragments can be detected at distances down to 50 AU. At smaller distances, the fragments usually merge with the central density peak. The likelihood for detecting the fragments reduces significantly for a lower resolution of 0.5"". Some of the most massive fragments, regardless of their orbital distance, can produce characteristic peaks at approximately 5 micron and hence their presence can be indirectly inferred from the observed spectral energy distributions of protostars.",13,[],1
1301.3673,astro-ph,"The Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) are features in the matter power spectrum on scales of order 100-150 h-1 Mpc that promise to be a powerful tool to constrain and test cosmological models. The BAO have attracted such attention that future upcoming surveys have been designed with the BAO at the forefront of the primary science goals. Recent studies have advocated the use of a spherical-Fourier Bessel (sFB) expansion for future wide field surveys that cover both wide and deep regions of the sky necessitating the simultaneous treatment of the spherical sky geometry as well as the extended radial coverage. Ignoring the possible effects of growth, which is not expected to be significant at low redshifts, we present an extended analysis of the BAOs using the sFB formalism by taking into account the role of non-linearities and linear redshift distortions in the oscillations observed in the galaxy power spectrum. The sFB power spectrum has both radial and tangential dependence and it has been shown that in the limit that we approach a deep survey the sFB power spectrum is purely radial and collapses to the Cartesian Fourier power spectrum. This radialisation of information is shown to hold even in the presence of redshift space distortions (RSD) and 1-loop corrections to the galaxy power spectrum albeit with modified tangential and radial dependence. As per previous studies we find that the introduction of non-linearities leads to a damping of the oscillations in the matter power spectrum.",13,[],1

Up to 40% of the initial core mass may be ejected through this outflow. The primary difficulty in performing these simulations is maintaining the divergence free constraint of the magnetic field, and to address this issue, we have developed a new divergence cleaning method which has allowed us to stably follow the evolution of these protostellar jets for long periods. The simulations performed of supersonic MHD turbulence are able to exponentially amplify magnetic energy by up to 10 orders of magnitude via turbulent dynamo.

1306.6190,astro-ph,"We investigate the evolution of magnetohydrodynamic/hydromagnetic perturbations in the presence of stochastic noise in rotating shear flows. The particular emphasis is the flows whose angular velocity decreases but specific angular momentum increases with increasing radial coordinate. Such flows, however, are Rayleigh stable, but must be turbulent in order to explain astrophysical observed data and, hence, reveal a mismatch between the linear theory and observations/experiments. The mismatch seems to have been resolved, atleast in certain regimes, in the presence of weak magnetic field revealing magnetorotational instability. The present work explores the effects of stochastic noise on such magnetohydrodynamic flows, in order to resolve the above mismatch generically for the hot flows. We essentially concentrate on a small section of such a flow which is nothing but a plane shear flow supplemented by the Coriolis effect, mimicking a small section of an astrophysical accretion disk around a compact object. It is found that such stochastically driven flows exhibit large temporal and spatial auto-correlations and cross-correlations of perturbation and hence large energy dissipations of perturbation, which generate instability. Interestingly, auto-correlations and cross-correlations appear independent of background angular velocity profiles, which are Rayleigh stable, indicating their universality. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to understand the evolution of three-dimensional hydromagnetic perturbations in rotating shear flows in the presence of stochastic noise.",13,"['cond-mat', 'physics']",1

We utilize a Monte Carlo cosmic ray transport model for particle energies of 1 MeV < E < 1 GeV, and an analytic cosmic ray transport model for particle energies of 1 GeV < E < 1 TeV in order to investigate the cosmic ray enhancement of free electrons in substellar atmospheres of free-floating objects. The cosmic ray calculations are applied to Drift-Phoenix model atmospheres of an example brown dwarf with effective temperature Teff = 1500 K, and two example giant gas planets (Teff = 1000 K, 1500 K). For the model brown dwarf atmosphere, the electron fraction is enhanced significantly by cosmic rays when the pressure pgas < 10-2 bar. Our example giant gas planet atmosphere suggests that the cosmic ray enhancement extends to 10-4 - 10-2 bar, depending on the effective temperature. For the model atmosphere of the example giant gas planet considered here (Teff = 1000 K), cosmic rays bring the degree of ionization to fe ~ 10-8 when pgas < 10-8 bar, suggesting that this part of the atmosphere may behave as a weakly ionized plasma. Although cosmic rays enhance the degree of ionization by over three orders of magnitude in the upper atmosphere, the effect is not likely to be significant enough for sustained coupling of the magnetic field to the gas.",13,[],1
1309.4771,astro-ph,"The (absence of detecting) lensing dispersion of Supernovae type Ia (SNIa) can be used as a novel and extremely efficient probe of cosmology. In this preliminary example we analyze its consequences for the primordial power spectrum. The main setback is the knowledge of the power spectrum in the non-linear regime, 1 Mpc-1 < k < 102-103 Mpc-1 up to redshift of about unity. By using the lensing dispersion and conservative estimates in this regime of wavenumbers, we show how the current upper bound sigmamu(z=1) < 0.12on existing data gives strong indirect constraints on the primordial power spectrum. The probe extends our handle on the spectrum to a total of 12-15 inflation e-folds. These constraints are so strong that they are already ruling out a large portion of the parameter space allowed by PLANCK for running alpha = d ns / d ln k and running of running beta = d2 ns / d ln k2. The bounds follow a linear relation to a very good accuracy. A conservative bound disfavors any enhancement above the line beta(k0)=0.036-0.42 alpha(k0) and a realistic estimate disfavors any enhancement above the line beta(k0)=0.022-0.44 alpha(k0).",13,"['gr-qc', 'hep-ph', 'hep-th']",1

We find that the simulated power spectra show a broad feature at high frequency, which increases in amplitude with the inclination of the observer. We show that this high-frequency feature is a product of the Doppler effect and that its location is a function of the mass and spin of the black hole.

The survey would identify over 250 disk-lens/disk-source microlensing events per year that peak at r<19, including 10% reaching the high magnification A>100 that makes them especially sensitive to planets. Intensive followup of these events would be required to find planets, similar to what is done presently for Galactic bulge microlensing. The same data would enable a wealth of other science, including detection of isolated black holes, systematic study of brown-dwarf binaries, a pre-explosion lightcurve of the next Galactic supernova, pre-explosion lightcurves of stellar mergers, early nova lightcurves, proper motions of many more stars than can be reached by GAIA, and probably much more. As usual, the most exciting discoveries from probing the huge parameter space encompassed by Galactic-plane stellar populations might well be serendipitous. Unfortunately, the LSST collaboration plans to exclude the first and fourth quadrants of the Galactic plane from their ""synoptic"" observations because the DC image that resulted from repeated observations would be limited by crowding.

1302.4678,astro-ph,"We present a radio polarization study of SN 1006, based on combined VLA and ATCA observations at 20 cm that resulted in sensitive images with an angular resolution of 10 arcsec. The fractional polarization in the two bright radio and X-ray lobes of the SNR is measured to be 0.17, while in the southeastern sector, where the radio and non-thermal X-ray emission are much weaker, the polarization fraction reaches a value of 0.6 - 0.2, close to the theoretical limit of 0.7. We interpret this result as evidence of a disordered, turbulent magnetic field in the lobes, where particle acceleration is believed to be efficient, and a highly ordered field in the southeast, where the acceleration efficiency has been shown to be very low. Utilizing the frequency coverage of our observations, an average rotation measure of ~12 rad/m2 is determined from the combined data set, which is then used to obtain the intrinsic direction of the magnetic field vectors. While the orientation of magnetic field vectors across the SNR shell appear radial, a large fraction of the magnetic vectors lie parallel to the Galactic Plane. Along the highly polarized southeastern rim, the field is aligned tangent to the shock, and therefore also nearly parallel to the Galactic Plane. These results strongly suggest that the ambient field surrounding SN 1006 is aligned with this direction (i.e., from northeast to southwest) and that the bright lobes are due to a polar cap geometry. Our study establishes that the most efficient particle acceleration and generation of magnetic turbulence in SN 1006 is attained for shocks in which the magnetic field direction and shock normal are quasi-parallel, while inefficient acceleration and little to no generation of magnetic turbulence obtains for the quasi-perpendicular case.",13,[],1

1305.2668,astro-ph,"We present the results of observations toward a low-mass Class-0/I protostar, [BHB2007]#11 (afterwards B59#11) at the nearby (d=130 pc) star forming region, Barnard 59 (B59) in the Pipe Nebula with the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) 10 m telescope (~22"" resolution) in CO(3--2), HCO, H13CO(4--3), and 1.1 mm dust-continuum emissions. We also show Submillimeter Array (SMA) data in 12CO, 13CO, C18O(2--1), and 1.3 mm dust-continuum emissions with ~5"" resolution. From ASTE CO(3--2) observations, we found that B59#11 is blowing a collimated outflow whose axis lies almost on the plane of the sky. The outflow traces well a cavity-like structure seen in the 1.1 mm dust-continuum emission. The results of SMA 13CO and C18O(2--1) observations have revealed that a compact and elongated structure of dense gas is associated with B59#11, which is oriented perpendicular to the outflow axis. There is a compact dust condensation with a size of 350x180 AU seen in the SMA 1.3 mm continuum map, and the direction of its major axis is almost the same as that of the dense gas elongation. The distributions of 13CO and C18O emission also show the velocity gradients along their major axes, which are considered to arise from the envelope/disk rotation. From the detailed analysis of the SMA data, we infer that B59#11 is surrounded by a Keplerian disk with a size of less than 350 AU. In addition, the SMA CO(2--1) image shows a velocity gradient in the outflow along the same direction as that of the dense gas rotation. We suggest that this velocity gradient shows a rotation of the outflow.",13,[],1
1309.6110,astro-ph,"We investigate the magnetic field which is generated by turbulent motions of a weakly ionized gas. Galactic molecular clouds give us an example of such a medium. As in the Kazantsev-Kraichnan model we assume a medium to be homogeneous and a neutral gas velocity field to be isotropic and delta-correlated in time. We take into consideration the presence of a mean magnetic field, which defines a preferred direction in space and eliminates isotropy of magnetic field correlators. Evolution equations for the anisotropic correlation function are derived. Isotropic cases with zero mean magnetic field as well as with small mean magnetic field are investigated. It is shown that stationary bounded solutions exist only in the presence of the mean magnetic field for the Kolmogorov neutral gas turbulence. The dependence of the magnetic field fluctuations amplitude on the mean field is calculated. The stationary anisotropic solution for the magnetic turbulence is also obtained for large values of the mean magnetic field.",13,[],1
1311.7451,astro-ph,"Radio source counts constrain galaxy populations and evolution, as well as the global star formation history. However, there is considerable disagreement among the published 1.4-GHz source counts below 100 microJy. Here we present a statistical method for estimating the microJy and even sub-microJy source count using new deep wide-band 3-GHz data in the Lockman Hole from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We analyzed the confusion amplitude distribution P(D), which provides a fresh approach in the form of a more robust model, with a comprehensive error analysis. We tested this method on a large-scale simulation, incorporating clustering and finite source sizes. We discuss in detail our statistical methods for fitting using Monte Carlo Markov chains, handling correlations, and systematic errors from the use of wide-band radio interferometric data. We demonstrated that the source count can be constrained down to 50 nJy, a factor of 20 below the rms confusion. We found the differential source count near 10 microJy to have a slope of -1.7, decreasing to about -1.4 at fainter flux densities. At 3GHz the rms confusion in an 8arcsec FWHM beam is ~ 1.2 microJy/beam, and a radio background temperature ~ 14mK. Our counts are broadly consistent with published evolutionary models. With these results we were also able to constrain the peak of the Euclidean normalized differential source count of any possible new radio populations that would contribute to the cosmic radio background down to 50 nJy.",13,[],1
1304.6981,astro-ph,"The structure of the coronal magnetic field prior to eruptive processes and the conditions for the onset of eruption are important issues that can be addressed through studying the magnetohydrodynamic stability and evolution of nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) models. This paper uses data-constrained NLFFF models of a solar active region that erupted on 2010 April 8 as initial condition in MHD simulations. These models, constructed with the techniques of flux rope insertion and magnetofrictional relaxation, include a stable, an approximately marginally stable, and an unstable configuration. The simulations confirm previous related results of magnetofrictional relaxation runs, in particular that stable flux rope equilibria represent key features of the observed pre-eruption coronal structure very well and that there is a limiting value of the axial flux in the rope for the existence of stable NLFFF equilibria. The specific limiting value is located within a tighter range, due to the sharper discrimination between stability and instability by the MHD description. The MHD treatment of the eruptive configuration yields very good agreement with a number of observed features like the strongly inclined initial rise path and the close temporal association between the coronal mass ejection and the onset of flare reconnection. Minor differences occur in the velocity of flare ribbon expansion and in the further evolution of the inclination; these can be eliminated through refined simulations. We suggest that the slingshot effect of horizontally bent flux in the source region of eruptions can contribute significantly to the inclination of the rise direction. Finally, we demonstrate that the onset criterion formulated in terms of a threshold value for the axial flux in the rope corresponds very well to the threshold of the torus instability in the considered active region.",13,[],1

In this paper we perform a detailed analysis/comparison of measurements provided by the two instruments and taken during the extended site testing campaign carried out on 2007 at Cerro Paranal and promoted by the European Southern Observatory (ESO). The main and final goal of the study is to provide a detailed estimation of the measurements reliability i.e dispersion of turbulence measurements done by the two instruments at different heights above the ground. This information is directly related to our ability in estimating the absolute value of the turbulence stratification. To better analyse the uncertainties between the MASS and the GS we took advantage of the availability of measurements taken during the same campaign by a third independent instrument (DIMM - Differential Imaging Motion Monitor) measuring the integrated turbulence extended on the whole 20 km.

While NEAs are being discovered at a rate of 1000/year, only a ~75/year have well-measured rotation periods and shapes. Not only can the Kepler mission greatly increase the numbers of well-determined NEA rotation periods (to >1000 in 5 years), but may do so with order-of-magnitude greater precision than is routinely achieved from the ground. This will enable 3-D tomographic maps to be produced for the ~250 of the brighter NEAs.

1305.0029,astro-ph,Cosmic strings are topological defects which can be formed as a result of phase transitions with a spontaneous symmetry breaking in the early Universe. The possibility of the generation of a magnetic field around a cosmic string on the Grand Unification energy scale (GUT scale) in the early Universe immediately after the termination of the deconfinement-confinement phase transition has been analyzed. It is found that a circular current and a magnetic field directed along the string are induced around the string in the vacuum of a pseudoscalar matter consisting of charged pions. We also have studied the interaction between the magnetic flux tube surrounding the string (the string magnetosphere) and the cosmic plasma in the early Universe. A possibility of magnetization of the cosmic plasma surrounding the string owing to its interaction with the string magnetic field has been analyzed.,13,[],1
1306.5122,astro-ph,"The explosion energy and the ejecta mass of a type IIP supernova make up the basis for the theory of explosion mechanism. So far, these parameters have only been determined for seven events. Type IIP supernova 2008in is another well-observed event for which a detailed hydrodynamic modeling can be used to derive the supernova parameters. Hydrodynamic modeling was employed to describe the bolometric light curve and the expansion velocities at the photosphere level. A time-dependent model for hydrogen ionization and excitation was applied to model the Halpha and Hbeta line profiles. We found an ejecta mass of 13.6 Msun, an explosion energy of 5.05x1050 erg, a presupernova radius of 570 Rsun, and a radioactive Ni-56 mass of 0.015 Msun. The estimated progenitor mass is 15.5 Msun. We uncovered a problem of the Halpha and Hbeta description at the early phase, which cannot be resolved within a spherically symmetric model. The presupernova of SN 2008in was a normal red supergiant with the minimum mass of the progenitor among eight type IIP supernovae explored by means of the hydrodynamic modeling.

1311.5041,astro-ph,"Diagnostic diagrams of forbidden lines have been a useful tool for observers in astrophysics for many decades now. They are used to obtain information on the basic physical properties of thin gaseous nebulae. Some diagnostic diagrams are in wavelength domains which were difficult to take either due to missing wavelength coverage or low resolution of older spectrographs. Furthermore, most of the diagrams were calculated using just the species involved as a single atom gas, although several are affected by well-known fluorescence mechanisms as well. Additionally the atomic data have improved up to the present time. Aim of this work was a recalculation of well-known, but also of sparsely used, unnoted diagnostics diagrams. The new diagrams provide observers with modern, easy-to-use recipes to determine electron temperature and densities. The new diagnostic diagrams are calculated using large grids of parameter space in the photoionization code CLOUDY. For a given basic parameter (e.g. electron density or temperature) the solutions with cooling-heating-equilibrium are chosen to derive the diagnostic diagrams. Empirical numerical functions are fitted to provide formulas usable in e.g. data reduction pipelines.

Other spirals correspond to 13%, whereas elliptical galaxies comprise only 11% of the objects.

1304.4978,astro-ph,"Recently, the gravitational instability (GI) model of giant planet and brown dwarf formation has been revisited and recast into what is often referred to as the ""tidal downsizing"" hypothesis. The fragmentation of self-gravitating protostellar discs into gravitationally bound embryos - with masses of a few to tens of Jupiter masses, at semi major axes above 30 - 40 au - is followed by grain sedimentation inside the embryo, radial migration towards the central star and tidal disruption of the embryo's upper layers. The properties of the resultant object depends sensitively on the timescales upon which each process occurs. Therefore, GI followed by tidal downsizing can theoretically produce objects spanning a large mass range, from terrestrial planets to giant planets and brown dwarfs. Whether such objects can be formed in practice, and what proportions of the observed population they would represent, requires a more involved statistical analysis.   We present a simple population synthesis model of star and planet formation via GI and tidal downsizing. We couple a semi-analytic model of protostellar disc evolution to analytic calculations of fragmentation, initial embryo mass, grain growth and sedimentation, embryo migration and tidal disruption. While there are key pieces of physics yet to be incorporated, it represents a first step towards a mature statistical model of GI and tidal downsizing as a mode of star and planet formation.   We show results from four runs of the population synthesis model, varying the opacity law and the strength of migration, as well as investigating the effect of disc truncation during the fragmentation process. Our early results suggest that GI plus tidal downsizing is not the principal mode of planet formation, but remains an excellent means of forming gas giant planets, brown dwarfs and low mass stars at large semimajor axes.

1310.2172,astro-ph,"We present an analysis of the clustering of galaxies from z ~ 2 to the present day using the WIRCam Deep Survey (WIRDS). WIRDS combines deep near-infrared data with the deep optical data from the CFHTLS Deep fields, providing a photometric data-set over an effective area of 2.4 sq. deg., from which accurate photometric redshifts and stellar masses can be estimated. We use the data to calculate the angular correlation function for galaxy samples split by star-formation activity, stellar mass and redshift. We estimate the real-space clustering for each sample, determining clustering lengths and power-law slopes. For galaxies selected by constant mass, we find that the clustering scale shows no evolution up to z ~ 2. Splitting the galaxy sample by mass, we see that higher mass galaxies have larger clustering scales at all redshifts. We use our results to test the GALFORM semi-analytical galaxy formation model and find the two are consistent. We split the galaxy population into passive and star-forming populations and find that the passive galaxy population shows a significantly larger clustering scale at all redshifts than the star-forming population below masses of ~equation, showing that even at z ~ 2 passive galaxies exist in denser environments than the bulk of the star-forming galaxy population. For star-forming galaxies with stellar masses equation, we find a clustering strength of ~8Mpc/h across all redshifts, comparable to the measurements for the passive population. Also, for star-forming galaxies we see that clustering strength increases for higher stellar mass systems, however there is little sign of a mass dependence in passive galaxies. Finally, we investigate the connection between galaxy stellar mass and dark matter halo mass, showing a clear correlation between the two in both the WIRDS data and the GALFORM predictions.",13,[],1
1307.3420,astro-ph,"The high spatial and line sensitivity of ALMA opens the possibility of resolving emission from molecules in circumstellar disks. With an understanding of physical conditions under which molecules have high abundance, they can be used as direct tracers of distinct physical regions. In particular, DCO is expected to have an enhanced abundance within a few Kelvin of the CO freezeout temperature of 19 K, making it a useful probe of the cold disk midplane. We compare ALMA line observations of HD 163296 to a grid of models. We vary the upper- and lower-limit temperatures of the region in which DCO is present as well as the abundance of DCO in order to fit channel maps of the DCO J=5-4 line. To determine the abundance enhancement compared to the general interstellar medium, we carry out similar fitting to HCO J=4-3 and H13CO J=4-3 observations. ALMA images show centrally peaked extended emission from HCO and H13CO. DCO emission lies in a resolved ring from ~110 to 160 AU. The outer radius approximately corresponds to the size of the CO snowline as measured by previous lower resolution observations of CO lines in this disk. The ALMA DCO data now resolve and image the CO snowline directly. In the best fitting models, HCO exists in a region extending from the 19 K isotherm to the photodissociation layer with an abundance of 3x10-10 relative to H2. DCO exists within the 19-21 K region of the disk with an abundance ratio [DCO] / [HCO] = 0.3. This represents a factor of 104 enhancement of the DCO abundance within this narrow region of the HD 163296 disk. Such a high enhancement has only previously been seen in prestellar cores. The inferred abundances provide a lower limit to the ionization fraction in the midplane of the cold outer disk (approximately greater than 4x10-10), and suggest the utility of DCO as a tracer of its parent molecule H2D.

1303.4000,cond-mat,"Within the Free-Volume Asakura-Oosawa-Vrij (FVAO) theory of colloid-polymer mixtures, we show that unphysical gas-liquid binodals predicted in the regime of small attraction range (i.e. polymer size) are caused in part by the use of the Carnahan-Starling (CS) hard sphere (HS) reference free energy. Replacement of the CS expression with an alternative dramatically affects predicted phase behaviour and, for polydisperse colloid, the resultant fractionation predictions. Although short-range attractions render FVAO, as a perturbative HS-based theory, less accurate anyway, we argue that the particular effects of CS in this regime are an important consideration -- usually ignored -- in the evaluation of such theories. We refer to a variety of literature exhibiting similarly inaccurate gas-liquid binodals, and suggest CS's status as the de facto choice of hard sphere reference should be carefully considered where short-range attractions are present.",13,['physics'],8

However, the effect of these strong critical fluctuations on the superconducting condensate below equation is less well established. Here we report measurements of the magnetic penetration depth in heavy-fermion, iron-pnictide, and organic superconductors located close to antiferromagnetic quantum critical points showing that the superfluid density in these nodal superconductors universally exhibit, unlike the expected equation-linear dependence, an anomalous 3/2 power-law temperature dependence over a wide temperature range. We propose that this non-integer power-law can be explained if a strong renormalization of effective Fermi velocity due to quantum fluctuations occurs only for momenta equation close to the nodes in the superconducting energy gap equation.

1305.7450,cond-mat,"Ionic transport in nanopores or nanochannels is key to many cellular processes and is now being explored as a method for DNA/polymer sequencing and detection. Although apparently simple in its scope, the study of ionic dynamics in confined geometries has revealed interesting new phenomena that have an almost one-to-one correspondence with the quantum regime. The picture that emerges is that ions can form two `quasi-particle' states, one in which they surround themselves with other ions of opposite charge - ionic atmosphere - and one in which semi-bound water molecules form layers at different distances from the ions - hydration layers. The second state gives rise to two additional effects. In the first, which is a single quasi-particle effect, the ionic conductance through a nanopore is predicted to be `quantized' as a function of pore radius, with the corresponding `quantization units' not related to universal constants - like the Plank constant and the elementary charge - but rather to the radii of the hydration layers. The second effect instead involves the many-body interaction among ionic quasi-particles of the same sign, and occurs when the pore has a finite capacitance to accommodate ions so that there is a threshold concentration beyond which ions of the same sign are not energetically allowed to enter the pore. Similar to the electron transport case, the ionic counterpart appears only in the `quantum' regime, when the hydration layers forming the ionic quasi-particles need to break in order to pass through the pore. Here, we review all these phenomena, and discuss the conditions under which they may be detected making the analogy with the electronic transport case.

The spin electromagnetic fields turn out to be expressed in terms of a Rashba-induced effective vector potential, and thus they satisfy the Maxwell's equation.

This universal state is similar to the lowest-energy Caroli-de Gennes-Martricon bound state in a vortex core, but is bound to localized impurities. We argue that the observation of such a universal bound state can be a clear signature for identifying topological superfluids. We theoretically examine our argument for a spin-orbit coupled ultracold atomic Fermi gas trapped in a two-dimensional harmonic potential, by performing extensive self-consistent calculations within the mean-field Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory.

1309.6412,cond-mat,"We report on total-energy electronic-structure calculations in the density-functional theory performed for both monolayer and bilayer silicene on Ag(111) surfaces. The rt3 x rt3 structure observed experimentally and argued to be the monolayer silicene in the past [Chen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 085504 (2013)] is identified as the bilayer silicene on the Ag(111) surface. The identification is based on our accurate density-functional calculations in which three approximations, the local density approximation, the generalized-gradient approximation, and the van-der-Waals-density-functional approximation, to the exchange-correlation energy have been carefully examined. We find that the structural tristability exists for the rt3 x rt3 bilayer silicene. The calculated energy barriers among the three stable structures are in the range of 7 - 9 meV per Si atom, indicating possible flip-flop motions among the three. We have found that the flip-flop motion between the two of the three structures produces the honeycomb structure in the STM images, whereas the motion among the three does the 1 x 1 structure. We have found that the electron states which effectively follow Dirac equation in the freestanding silicene couple with the substrate Ag orbitals due to the bond formation, and shift downwards deep in the valence bands. This feature is common to all the stable or metastable silicene layer on the Ag(111) substrate.",13,[],8
1306.2154,cond-mat,"Differences in core level binding energies between atoms belonging to the same chemical species can be related to differences in their intra- and extra-atomic charge distributions, and differences in how their core holes are screened. With this in mind, we consider the charge-excess functional model (CEFM) for net atomic charges in alloys [E. Bruno et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 166401 (2003)]. We begin by deriving the CEFM energy function in order to elucidate the approximations which underpin this model. We thereafter consider the particular case of the CEFM in which the strength of the `local interactions' within all atoms are the same. We show that for binary alloys the ground state charges of this model can be expressed in terms of charge transfer between all pairs of unlike atoms analogously to the linear charge model [R. Magri et al., Phys. Rev. B 42, 11388 (1990)]. Hence the model considered is a generalization of the linear charge model for alloys containing more than two chemical species. We then determine the model's unknown `geometric factors' over a wide range of parameter space. These quantities are linked to the nature of charge screening in the model, and we illustrate that the screening becomes increasingly universal as the strength of the local interactions is increased. We then use the model to derive analytical expressions for various physical quantities, including the Madelung energy and the disorder broadening in the core level binding energies. These expressions are applied to ternary random alloys, for which it is shown that the Madelung energy and magnitude of disorder broadening are maximized at the composition at which the two species with the largest `electronegativity difference' are equal, while the remaining species having a vanishing concentration. This result is somewhat counterintuitive with regards to the disorder broadening since it does not...",13,[],8

The zero bias peak (ZBP) (a) appears above a threshold parallel bulk Zeeman field, (b) is stable for a range of bulk field before splitting, (c) disappears with rotation of the bulk Zeeman field, and, (d) is robust to weak disorder fluctuations. The ZBPs from the nanowire ends are also expected to produce splitting oscillations with the applied field similar to those from Majorana fermions. We find that the only unambiguous way to distinguish these trivial ZBPs (of height 4e2/h) from those arising from Majorana fermions (of height 2e2/h) is by comparing the (zero temperature) peak height and/or through an interference experiment.",13,[],8

Unlike the conventional triple-helix structure where its three strands of spheres are packed densely to form triads of close-packed, mutually touching spheres, in this novel helical phase only two of its three strands of spheres are packed in this densest arrangement and the overall structure resembles a hybrid of the single and the double helix. This article explains how this previously unknown structure can be constructed via the abovementioned sequential deposition of spheres, which involves manipulating the positions of a few spheres to create a template for the deposition process.

One of the oldest and structurally simplest hidden-order compounds, CeB6, became famous for an elusive phase that was attributed to the antiferroquadrupolar ordering of cerium-4f moments. In its ground state, CeB6 also develops a more usual antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. Hence, its essential low-temperature physics was always considered to be solely governed by AFM interactions between the dipolar and multipolar Ce moments. Here we overturn this established perspective by uncovering an intense ferromagnetic (FM) low-energy collective mode that dominates the magnetic excitation spectrum of CeB6. Our inelastic neutron-scattering data reveal that the intensity of this FM excitation by far exceeds that of conventional spin-wave magnons emanating from the AFM wave vectors, thus placing CeB6 much closer to a FM instability than could be anticipated. This propensity of CeB6 to ferromagnetism may account for much of its unexplained behavior, such as the existence of a pronounced electron spin resonance, and should lead to a substantial revision of existing theories that have so far largely neglected the role of FM interactions.",13,[],8

We show that even a single particle strongly modifies the detachment dynamics. The particle perturbs the thinning of the thread and a large droplet of fluid around the particle is formed. This perturbation leads to an acceleration of the detachment of the droplet compared to the detachment ob- served for a pure fluid. We quantify this acceleration for single particles of different sizes and link it to similar ob- servations for suspensions of small volume fractions.

Here we experimentally investigate the critical currents of superconducting films with a conformal array of nanoscale holes that have non-uniform density while preserving the local ordering. We find that the conformal array of nanoscle holes provides a more significant critical current enhancement at high magnetic fields.

1311.2164,cond-mat,"Structural, energetic and tribological characteristics of double-layer graphene with commensurate and incommensurate krypton spacers of nearly monolayer coverage are studied within the van der Waals-corrected density functional theory. It is shown that when the spacer is in the commensurate phase, the graphene layers have the AA stacking. For this phase, the barriers to relative in-plane translational and rotational motion and the shear mode frequency of the graphene layers are calculated. For the incommensurate phase, both of the barriers are found to be negligibly small. A considerable change of tunneling conductance between the graphene layers separated by the commensurate krypton spacer at their relative subangstrom displacement is revealed by the use of the Bardeen method.

The XMCD experiments performed at the M4,5 absorption edges of Np and Pu allow us to determine the spectroscopic branching ratio, which gives information on the coupling scheme in these materials. In all materials the intermediate coupling scheme is found appropriate. Comparison with the SQUID data for NpOs2 and PuFe2 allows a determination of the individual orbital and spin magnetic moments and the magnetic dipole contribution mmd. The resulting orbital and spin magnetic moments are in good agreement with earlier values determined by neutron diffraction, and the values of mmd are non-negligible, and close to those predicted for intermediate coupling. There is a comparatively large induced moment on the Os atom in NpOs2 such that the Os contribution to the total moment per formula unit is ~30% of the total. The spin and orbital moments at the Os site are parallel, in contrast to the anti-parallel configuration of Os impurities in 3d ferromagnetic transition metals. Calculations using the LDAU technique are reported.

1307.2242,cond-mat,"We study density wave instabilities in a doubly-degenerate Fermi-Fermi mixture with equation symmetry on a square lattice. For sufficiently large on-site inter-species repulsion, when the two species of fermions are both at half-filling, two conventional (equation-wave) number density waves are formed with a equation-phase difference between them to minimize the inter-species repulsion. Upon moving one species away from half-filling, an unconventional density wave with equation-wave symmetry emerges. When both species are away from the vicinity of half-filling, superconducting instabilities dominate. We present results of a functional renormalization-group calculation that maps out the phase diagram at weak couplings. Also, we provide a simple explanation for the emergence of the equation-density wave phase based on a four-patch model. We find a robust and general mechanism for equation-density-wave formation that is related to the shape and size of the Fermi surfaces. The density imbalance between the two species of fermions in the vicinity of half-filling leads to phase-space discrepancy for different inter-species Umklapp couplings. Using a phase space argument for leading corrections in the one-loop renormalization group approach to fermions, we show that the phase-space discrepancy in our system causes opposite flows for the two leading intra-species Umklapp couplings and that this triggers the equation-density-wave instability.",13,[],8

The zero temperature value of the large gap equation, which seems to follow a BCS-like behavior, results to be equation(0) = 17 cmequation. For the small gap, for which equation(0) = 8 cmequation, the temperature dependence cannot be clearly established. These gap values and those reported in the literature for the BaFeequationCoequationAsequation system by using infrared spectroscopy, when put together as a function of Tequation, show a tendency to cluster along two main curves, providing a unified perspective of the measured optical gaps.

PL spectra for MoS2 films deposited on SiO2 substrates are found to vary widely. This film-to-film variation is suppressed by additional capping of MoS2 with SiO2 and SiN, improving mechanical coupling of MoS2 with surrounding dielectrics. We show that the observed PL non-uniformities are related to strong variation in the local electron charging of MoS2 films. In completely encapsulated films, negative charging is enhanced leading to uniform optical properties. Observed great sensitivity of optical characteristics of 2D films to surface interactions has important implications for optoelectronics applications of layered materials.",13,[],8

I compare simulation results with spectral analysis of the networks and show that the quenched mean-field (QMF) approximation provides a reliable, relatively fast method to explore activity clustering. This suggests that QMF can be used for describing rare-region effects due to network inhomogeneities. Finite size study of the QMF shows the expected disappearance of the epidemic threshold equation in the thermodynamic limit and an inverse participation ratio equation, meaning localization in case of disassortative weight scheme. Contrary, for the multiplicative weights and the unweighted trees this value vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, suggesting only weak rare region effects in agreement with the dynamical simulations. Strong corrections to the mean-field behavior in case of disassortative weights explains the concave shape of the order parameter equation at the transition point.

In this paper, we enhance the capability of a MoD system by deploying robotic shared vehicles that can autonomously cruise the streets to be hailed by users. A key challenge to managing the MoD system effectively is that of real-time, fine-grained mobility demand sensing and prediction. This paper presents a novel decentralized data fusion and active sensing algorithm for real-time, fine-grained mobility demand sensing and prediction with a fleet of autonomous robotic vehicles in a MoD system. Our Gaussian process (GP)-based decentralized data fusion algorithm can achieve a fine balance between predictive power and time efficiency. We theoretically guarantee its predictive performance to be equivalent to that of a sophisticated centralized sparse approximation for the GP model: The computation of such a sparse approximate GP model can thus be distributed among the MoD vehicles, hence achieving efficient and scalable demand prediction. Though our decentralized active sensing strategy is devised to gather the most informative demand data for demand prediction, it can achieve a dual effect of fleet rebalancing to service the mobility demands. Empirical evaluation on real-world mobility demand data shows that our proposed algorithm can achieve a better balance between predictive accuracy and time efficiency than state-of-the-art algorithms.",13,[],7
1310.5035,cs,"Many problems in machine learning and other fields can be (re)for-mulated as linearly constrained separable convex programs. In most of the cases, there are multiple blocks of variables. However, the traditional alternating direction method (ADM) and its linearized version (LADM, obtained by linearizing the quadratic penalty term) are for the two-block case and cannot be naively generalized to solve the multi-block case. So there is great demand on extending the ADM based methods for the multi-block case. In this paper, we propose LADM with parallel splitting and adaptive penalty (LADMPSAP) to solve multi-block separable convex programs efficiently. When all the component objective functions have bounded subgradients, we obtain convergence results that are stronger than those of ADM and LADM, e.g., allowing the penalty parameter to be unbounded and proving the sufficient and necessary conditions for global convergence. We further propose a simple optimality measure and reveal the convergence rate of LADMPSAP in an ergodic sense. For programs with extra convex set constraints, with refined parameter estimation we devise a practical version of LADMPSAP for faster convergence. Finally, we generalize LADMPSAP to handle programs with more difficult objective functions by linearizing part of the objective function as well. LADMPSAP is particularly suitable for sparse representation and low-rank recovery problems because its subproblems have closed form solutions and the sparsity and low-rankness of the iterates can be preserved during the iteration. It is also highly parallelizable and hence fits for parallel or distributed computing. Numerical experiments testify to the advantages of LADMPSAP in speed and numerical accuracy.",13,"['math', 'stat']",7

We introduce the beyond worst-case synthesis problem, which is to construct strategies that guarantee some quantitative requirement in the worst-case while providing an higher expected value against a particular stochastic model of the environment given as input. This problem is relevant to produce system controllers that provide nice expected performance in the everyday situation while ensuring a strict (but relaxed) performance threshold even in the event of very bad (while unlikely) circumstances.

1306.3532,cs,"In this paper we present a novel probabilistic sampling-based motion planning algorithm called the Fast Marching Tree algorithm (FMT*). The algorithm is specifically aimed at solving complex motion planning problems in high-dimensional configuration spaces. This algorithm is proven to be asymptotically optimal and is shown to converge to an optimal solution faster than its state-of-the-art counterparts, chiefly PRM* and RRT*. The FMT* algorithm performs a ""lazy"" dynamic programming recursion on a predetermined number of probabilistically-drawn samples to grow a tree of paths, which moves steadily outward in cost-to-arrive space. As a departure from previous analysis approaches that are based on the notion of almost sure convergence, the FMT* algorithm is analyzed under the notion of convergence in probability: the extra mathematical flexibility of this approach allows for convergence rate bounds--the first in the field of optimal sampling-based motion planning. Specifically, for a certain selection of tuning parameters and configuration spaces, we obtain a convergence rate bound of order equation, where equation is the number of sampled points, equation is the dimension of the configuration space, and equation is an arbitrarily small constant. We go on to demonstrate asymptotic optimality for a number of variations on FMT*, namely when the configuration space is sampled non-uniformly, when the cost is not arc length, and when connections are made based on the number of nearest neighbors instead of a fixed connection radius. Numerical experiments over a range of dimensions and obstacle configurations confirm our theoretical and heuristic arguments by showing that FMT*, for a given execution time, returns substantially better solutions than either PRM* or RRT*, especially in high-dimensional configuration spaces and in scenarios where collision-checking is expensive.",13,[],7

Of particular importance is one such evidence integration formulation, produced under a belief oriented interpretation, which incorporates both modus ponens and modus tollens inferential mechanisms, allows integration of conditioned and unconditioned knowledge without resorting to iterative or sequential approximations, and produces elementary mass distributions as outputs using similar distributions as inputs.",13,[],7

Instead of inducing this knowledge in the form of graphs, as in much of the previous work, in our method, distributed representations of event realizations are computed based on distributed representations of predicates and their arguments, and then these representations are used to predict prototypical event orderings. The parameters of the compositional process for computing the event representations and the ranking component of the model are jointly estimated from texts.

In particular, we give a simple nonadaptive sampling scheme where the singular values of equation are estimated within relative error with constant probability. Our proven bounds focus on the MapReduce framework, which has become the de facto tool for handling such large matrices that cannot be stored or even streamed through a single machine.   On the way, we give a general method to compute equation. We preserve singular values of equation with equation relative error with shuffle size equation and reduce-key complexity equation. We further show that if only specific entries of equation are required and equation has nonnegative entries, then we can reduce the shuffle size to equation and reduce-key complexity to equation, where equation is the minimum cosine similarity for the entries being estimated. All of our bounds are independent of equation, the larger dimension. We provide open-source implementations in Spark and Scalding, along with experiments in an industrial setting.",13,['math'],7

1305.6489,cs,"Sensor placement for the purpose of detecting/tracking news outbreak and preventing rumor spreading is a challenging problem in a large scale online social network (OSN). This problem is a kind of subset selection problem: choosing a small set of items from a large population so to maximize some prespecified set function. However, it is known to be NP-complete. Existing heuristics are very costly especially for modern OSNs which usually contain hundreds of millions of users. This paper aims to design methods to find \emphgood solutions that can well trade off efficiency and accuracy. We first show that it is possible to obtain a high quality solution with a probabilistic guarantee from a ""\em candidate set"" of the underlying social network. By exploring this candidate set, one can increase the efficiency of placing social sensors. We also present how this candidate set can be obtained using ""\em graph sampling"", which has an advantage over previous methods of not requiring the prior knowledge of the complete network topology. Experiments carried out on two real datasets demonstrate not only the accuracy and efficiency of our approach, but also effectiveness in detecting and predicting news outbreak.",13,['physics'],7
1312.0650,cs,"Access to online contents represents a large share of the Internet traffic. Most such contents are multimedia items which are user-generated, i.e., posted online by the contents' owners. In this paper we focus on how those who provide contents can leverage online platforms in order to profit from their large base of potential viewers.   Actually, platforms like Vimeo or YouTube provide tools to accelerate the dissemination of contents, i.e., recommendation lists and other re-ranking mechanisms. Hence, the popularity of a content can be increased by paying a cost for advertisement: doing so, it will appear with some priority in the recommendation lists and will be accessed more frequently by the platform users.   Ultimately, such acceleration mechanism engenders a competition among online contents to gain popularity. In this context, our focus is on the structure of the acceleration strategies which a content provider should use in order to optimally promote a content given a certain daily budget. Such a best response indeed depends on the strategies adopted by competing content providers. Also, it is a function of the potential popularity of a content and the fee paid for the platform advertisement service.   We formulate the problem as a differential game and we solve it for the infinite horizon case by deriving the structure of certain Nash equilibria of the game.",13,[],7

That algorithm learns networks based on penalized likelihood scores, which include the BIC/MDL score and various approximations to the Bayesian score.

It is shown that the well-known re-encoding projection due to Koetter et al. leads to one type of such prefactors. The new type of Sierpinski prefactors is introduced. The latter are based on the fact that many binomial coefficients in the Hasse derivative associated with the Guruswami-Sudan interpolation step are zero modulo the base field characteristic.

Common tasks then are to devise a classifier deciding which of the clusters a new point is associated to, finding outliers with respect to the clusters, or identifying the type of clustering used for the partition.   One of the common kinds of clusterings are (balanced) least-squares assignments with respect to a given set of sites. For these, there is a 'separating power diagram' for which each cluster lies in its own cell.   In the present paper, we aim for efficient algorithms for outlier detection and the computation of thresholds that measure how similar a clustering is to a least-squares assignment for fixed sites. For this purpose, we devise a new model for the computation of a 'soft power diagram', which allows a soft separation of the clusters with 'point counting properties'; e.g. we are able to prescribe how many points we want to classify as outliers.   As our results hold for a more general non-convex model of free sites, we describe it and our proofs in this more general way.

In this paper, we consider the problem of automatically correcting an unrealizable specification given in the generalized reactivity (1) fragment of linear temporal logic by adding assumptions on the environment. When a temporal-logic specification is unrealizable, the synthesis algorithm computes a counter-strategy as a witness.

In particular, using GPUs for general purpose computing has brought forth several success stories with respect to time taken, cost, power, and other metrics.

As CPUs evolve and also offer matching computational resources, it is important to also include CPUs in the computation. We call this the hybrid computing model. Indeed, most computer systems of the present age offer a degree of heterogeneity and therefore such a model is quite natural.   We reevaluate the claim of a recent paper by Lee et al.(ISCA 2010). We argue that the right question arising out of Lee et al. (ISCA 2010) should be how to use a CPUGPU platform efficiently, instead of whether one should use a CPU or a GPU exclusively. To this end, we experiment with a set of 13 diverse workloads ranging from databases, image processing, sparse matrix kernels, and graphs.

The efficacy of the proposed solution approach is verified with theoretical analysis and numerical case studies.,13,['math'],7
1307.0276,cs,"This paper considers the controllability analysis and fault tolerant control problem for a class of hexacopters. It is shown that the considered hexacopter is uncontrollable when one rotor fails, even though the hexacopter is over-actuated and its controllability matrix is row full rank. According to this, a fault tolerant control strategy is proposed to control a degraded system, where the yaw states of the considered hexacopter are ignored. Theoretical analysis indicates that the degraded system is controllable if and only if the maximum lift of each rotor is greater than a certain value. The simulation and experiment results on a prototype hexacopter show the feasibility of our controllability analysis and degraded control strategy.",13,[],7
1304.6693,cs,"A transmitter Alice may wish to reliably transmit a message to a receiver Bob over a binary symmetric channel (BSC), while simultaneously ensuring that her transmission is deniable from an eavesdropper Willie. That is, if Willie listening to Alice's transmissions over a ""significantly noisier"" BSC than the one to Bob, he should be unable to estimate even whether Alice is transmitting. We consider two scenarios. In our first scenario, we assume that the channel transition probability from Alice to Bob and Willie is perfectly known to all parties. Here, even when Alice's (potential) communication scheme is publicly known to Willie (with no common randomness between Alice and Bob), we prove that over 'n' channel uses Alice can transmit a message of length O(sqrtn) bits to Bob, deniably from Willie. We also prove information-theoretic order-optimality of this result. In our second scenario, we allow uncertainty in the knowledge of the channel transition probability parameters. In particular, we assume that the channel transition probabilities for both Bob and Willie are uniformly drawn from a known interval. Here, we show that, in contrast to the previous setting, Alice can communicate O(n) bits of message reliably and deniably (again, with no common randomness). We give both an achievability result and a matching converse for this setting. Our work builds upon the work of Bash et al on AWGN channels (but with common randomness) and differs from other recent works (by Wang et al and Bloch) in two important ways - firstly our deniability metric is variational distance (as opposed to Kullback-Leibler divergence), and secondly, our techniques are significantly different from these works.",13,['math'],7

1304.4535,cs,"Some mixtures, such as colloids like milk, blood, and gelatin, have homogeneous appearance when viewed with the naked eye, however, to observe them at the nanoscale is possible to understand the heterogeneity of its components. The same phenomenon can occur in pattern recognition in which it is possible to see heterogeneous patterns in texture images. However, current methods of texture analysis can not adequately describe such heterogeneous patterns. Common methods used by researchers analyse the image information in a global way, taking all its features in an integrated manner. Furthermore, multi-scale analysis verifies the patterns at different scales, but still preserving the homogeneous analysis. On the other hand various methods use textons to represent the texture, breaking texture down into its smallest unit. To tackle this problem, we propose a method to identify texture patterns not small as textons at distinct scales enhancing the separability among different types of texture. We find sub patterns of texture according to the scale and then group similar patterns for a more refined analysis. Tests were performed in four static texture databases and one dynamic one. Results show that our method provides better classification rate compared with conventional approaches both in static and in dynamic texture.",13,[],7
1309.5138,cs,"The aim of static analysis is to infer invariants about programs that are precise enough to establish semantic properties, such as the absence of run-time errors. Broadly speaking, there are two major branches of static analysis for imperative programs. Pointer and shape analyses focus on inferring properties of pointers, dynamically-allocated memory, and recursive data structures, while numeric analyses seek to derive invariants on numeric values. Although simultaneous inference of shape-numeric invariants is often needed, this case is especially challenging and is not particularly well explored. Notably, simultaneous shape-numeric inference raises complex issues in the design of the static analyzer itself.   In this paper, we study the construction of such shape-numeric, static analyzers. We set up an abstract interpretation framework that allows us to reason about simultaneous shape-numeric properties by combining shape and numeric abstractions into a modular, expressive abstract domain. Such a modular structure is highly desirable to make its formalization and implementation easier to do and get correct. To achieve this, we choose a concrete semantics that can be abstracted step-by-step, while preserving a high level of expressiveness. The structure of abstract operations (i.e., transfer, join, and comparison) follows the structure of this semantics. The advantage of this construction is to divide the analyzer in modules and functors that implement abstractions of distinct features.",13,[],7

The configuration of the scalar field depends on the slice of the AdS spacetime. These branes are supported by the tension and not coupled to the scalar field. The Minkowski brane solution can be obtained when the brane tension is tuned to the bulk contributions. Once this tuning relation is broken, the de Sitter brane solutions are obtained. The de Sitter brane solutions have two branches. One has the smooth limit to the case where the scalar field becomes trivial, while the other branch does not. The latter branch has the upper bound on the brane tension, where the expansion rate vanishes.

The Reissner-Nordstrom dynamics exhibit saddle-center, transcritical, pseudo-transcritical, and additional bifurcations that combine all three previous bifurcations in various combinations. Periastron precession in the Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime is analyzed using the phase-plane and bifurcation techniques and extended to include a bifurcation point of the dynamics. A numerical solution at these parameter values illustrates that such orbits typically yield a much larger precession value compared to the standard value for timelike, precession. The acausal geodesics considered by Brigman are also discussed and their precession value is calculated.",13,[],13
1303.2993,gr-qc,"We consider stationary, cylindrically symmetric configurations in general relativity and formulate necessary conditions for the existence of rotating cylindrical wormholes. It is shown that in a comoving reference frame the rotational part of the gravitational field is separated from its static part and forms an effective stress-energy tensor with exotic properties, which favors the existence of wormhole throats. Exact vacuum and scalar-vacuum solutions (with a massless scalar) are considered as examples, and it turns out that even vacuum solutions can be of wormhole nature. However, solutions obtainable in this manner cannot have well-behaved asymptotic regions, which excludes the existence of wormhole entrances appearing as local objects in our Universe. To overcome this difficulty, we try to build configurations with flat asymptotic regions by the cut-and-paste procedure: on both sides of the throat, a wormhole solution is matched to a properly chosen region of flat space at some surfaces equation and equation. It is shown, however, that if we describe the throat region with vacuum or scalar-vacuum solutions, one or both thin shells appearing on equation and equation inevitably violate the null energy condition. In other words, although rotating wormhole solutions are easily found without exotic matter, such matter is still necessary for obtaining asymptotic flatness.",13,['astro-ph'],13

However, a complete proof of this hypothesis is still lacking and the validity of the conjecture has therefore remained one of the most important open questions in general relativity. In this study we analyze a gedanken experiment which is designed to challenge cosmic censorship by trying to overcharge a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole: a charged shell is lowered \it adiabatically into the charged black hole. The mass-energy delivered to the black hole can be red-shifted by letting the dropping point of the shell approach the black-hole horizon. On the other hand, the electric charge of the shell is not red-shifted by the gravitational field of the black hole. It therefore seems, at first sight, that the charged shell is not hindered from entering the black hole, overcharging it and removing its horizon. However, in the present study we prove that the exposure of a naked singularity to distant observers is actually excluded due to the formation of a new (and \it larger) horizon around the original black hole.

1312.3253,gr-qc,"I show that the gravitational dynamics in a bulk region of space can be connected to a thermodynamic description in the boundary of that region, thereby providing clear physical interpretations of several mathematical features of classical general relativity: (1) The Noether charge contained in a bulk region, associated with a specific time evolution vector field, has a direct thermodynamic interpretation as the gravitational heat content of the boundary surface. (2) This result, in turn, shows that all static spacetimes maintain holographic equipartition; in these spacetimes, the number of degrees of freedom in the boundary is equal to the number of degrees of freedom in the bulk. (3) In a general, evolving spacetime, the rate of change of gravitational momentum is related to the difference between the number of bulk and boundary degrees of freedom. It is this departure from the holographic equipartition which drives the time evolution of the spacetime. (4) When the equations of motion hold, the (naturally defined) total energy of the gravity plus matter within a bulk region, will be equal to the boundary heat content. (5) After motivating the need for an alternate description of gravity (if we have to solve the cosmological constant problem), I describe a thermodynamic variational principle based on null surfaces to achieve this goal. The concept of gravitational heat density of the null surfaces arises naturally from the Noether charge associated with the null congruence. The null surface variational principle, in fact, extremises the total heat content of the matter plus gravity system. Several variations on this theme and implications are described.

1304.5675,gr-qc,"Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), the inspirals of compact objects into supermassive black holes, are important gravitational wave sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We study the performance of various post-Newtonian (PN) template families relative to the high precision numerical waveforms in the context of EMRI parameter estimation with LISA. Expressions for the time domain waveforms TaylorT1, TaylorT2, TaylorT3, TaylorT4 and TaylorEt are derived up to 22PN order, i.e equation (equation is the characteristic velocity of the binary) beyond the Newtonian term, for a test particle in a circular orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. The phase difference between the above 22PN waveform families and numerical waveforms are evaluated during two-year inspirals for two prototypical EMRI systems with mass ratios equation and equation. We find that the dephases (in radians) for TaylorT1 and TaylorT2, respectively, are about equation (equation) and equation (equation) for mass ratio equation (equation). This suggests that using 22PN TaylorT1 or TaylorT2 waveforms for parameter estimation of EMRIs will result in accuracies comparable to numerical waveform accuracy for most of the LISA parameter space. On the other hand, from the dephase results, we find that TaylorT3, TaylorT4 and TaylorEt fare relatively poorly as one approaches the last stable orbit. This implies that, as for comparable mass binaries using the 3.5PN phase of waveforms, the 22PN TaylorT3 and TaylorEt approximants do not perform well enough for the EMRIs. The reason underlying the poor performance of TaylorT3, TaylorT4 and TaylorEt relative to TaylorT1 and TaylorT2 is finally examined.",13,[],13

Therefore, they are expected to experience the full collision history propagating through and interacting with the QCD medium. The parton energy loss, which is sensitive to the transport coefficients of the produced medium, can be studied experimentally by measuring the nuclear modication factor (equation) which accounts for the modication of the heavy-flavoured hadron yield in Pb-Pb collisions with respect to pp collisions.

We report on the first measurement of the form factor of neutral kaons at the large timelike momentum transfer of equation GeVequation by measuring the cross section for equation at equation GeV using CLEO-c data with an integrated luminosity of 586 pbequation. We obtain equation, with a 90% C.L. interval of equation. This is nearly an order of magnitude smaller than equation, and indicates that the effect of equation breaking is small.

While prior studies have indicated the presence of light flavor quark (2SC) or symmetric color-flavor-locked (CFL) pairing at low temperatures, we find that in the absence of a local color neutrality constraint the inclusion of the Polyakov loop gives rise to phases in which all quark colors and flavors pair, but with unequal magnitudes. We study this asymmetric color-flavor-locked (ACFL) phase, which can exist even for equal mass quarks, identifying its location in the phase diagram, the order of the associated phase transitions, and its symmetry breaking pattern, which proves to be the intersection of the symmetry groups of the 2SC and CFL phases. We also investigate the effects of the strange quark mass on this new phase and the QCD phase diagram generally. Finally, we analyze the effect of a local color neutrality constraint on these phases of asymmetric pairing. We observe that for massless quarks the neutrality constraint renders the 2SC phase energetically unfavorable, eliminating it at low temperatures, and giving rise to the previously proposed low temperature critical point, with associated continuity between the hadronic and ACFL phases.

For the decay width into the channel equation, we find the value equation MeV, which is much smaller than the total experimental width equation MeV.

1306.6474,hep-ph,Neutral mesons exhibit a phenomenon called flavour mixing. As a consequence of a second order weak process the flavour eigenstates corresponding to the meson and its anti-meson are superpositions of two mass eigenstates. A meson produced in a flavour state changes into an anti-meson and back again as a function of time. Such flavour oscillations are considered sensitive probes of physics beyond the Standard Model. In this brief review I summarize the status of experimental constraints on mixing parameters in the Bs meson system.,13,[],2

Motivated by this possibility, we revisit the annihilation of a 10 GeV neutralino DM in the MSSM via stau exchange. The required stau masses and mixing, consistent with LEP direct search and electroweak precision constraints, are correlated with a possible enhancement of the Higgs decay rate to two photons.

In particular, for a physical pion mass, the distribution which includes the effect of mesonic fluctuations, differs considerably from both, the mean-field and Skellam distributions. The latter is considered as a reference for a non-critical behavior. A characteristic feature of the net quark number probability distribution is that, in the vicinity of the chiral crossover transition in the O(4) universality class, it is narrower than the corresponding mean-field and Skellam function.

Our framework is based on B-L extension of the Standard Model. The construction ensures the absence of any mixing between active neutrinos and the aforementioned dark matter field. This circumvents the usual constraints on the mass of warm dark matter imposed by X-ray observations. We show that over-abundance of thermally produced warm dark matter (which nevertheless do not reach chemical equilibrium) can be reduced to an acceptable range in the presence of a moduli field decaying into radiation --- though only when the reheat temperature is low enough. Our warm dark matter candidate can also be produced directly from the decay of the moduli field during reheating.

We use as basis of states, equation, equation states, with equation baryon charmed states belonging to the 20 representations of SU(4) with equation. In addition we also include the equation and equation states. The inclusion of these coupled channels is demanded by heavy quark spin symmetry, since in the large equation limit the equation and equation states are degenerate and are obtained from each other by means of a spin rotation, under which QCD is invariant. The novelty in the work is that we use dynamics from the extrapolation of the local hidden gauge model to SU(4) and we show that this dynamics fully respects the constraints of heavy quark spin symmetry.   With the full space of states demanded by the heavy quark spin symmetry and the dynamics of the local hidden gauge we look for states dynamically generated and find four basic states which are bound, corresponding to equation, equation, equation and equation, decaying mostly into equation and equation. All the states appear in isospin equation and we find no bound states or resonances in equation.

Both diffractive bremsstrahlung (Drell-Hiida-Deck--type model), photon-photon and photon-omega exchange mechanisms are included in the calculation.

The corresponding differential cross sections in rapidities and transverse momenta of outgoing protons and pions as well as relative azimuthal angle between outgoing protons are calculated for RHIC and LHC energies. The hadronic bremsstrahlung contributions dominate at large (forward, backward) pion rapidities. The diffractive nonresonant background contributes at small equation invariant mass and could be therefore misinterpreted as the Roper resonance. We predict strong dependence of the slope in equation (squared four-momentum transfer between ingoing and outgoing proton) on the mass of the supplementary excited equation system. At high energies and midrapidities, the photon-photon contribution dominates over the diffractive components, however, the corresponding cross section is rather small. The photon-odderon and odderon-photon contributions are included in addition and first estimates (upper limits) of their contributions to rapidity and transverse momentum distribution of neutral pions are presented. We suggest a search for the odderon contribution at midrapidity and at equation 0.5 GeV. Our predictions are ready for verification at RHIC and LHC.

We consider GGM models with 3, 5 and 6 input parameters and reduce the fine-tuning by assuming simple relations between them at the high scale. We are able to find solutions which give the correct value of the light Higgs mass and are less fine-tuned than models with standard gauge mediation (and with gravity mediation), however one never finds fine-tung measure lower than about equation if one neglects the data on equation and and about four times more if one takes the constraint given by equation into account. In general the current equation data push the models towards the high fine-tuning region. It is interesting to note, that once one removes the contributions to the finetuning induced by equation and equation, then in the case with neglected equation constraint one can easily find realistic vacua with fine-tuning of order 1 or lower, while the fine-tung remains always large when the equation constraint is enforced. One should note, that in the last case even a small shift of the light Higgs mass towards smaller values both reduces fine-tuning and helps to improve agreement of a model with equation data.",13,[],2

While the perpendicular component of the magnetic field tends to make the chiral symmetry breaking stronger, the effect of the parallel component of the field in these planar systems is to weaken the chiral symmetry through the enhancement of the Zeeman energy term. We show that this competing effect, when combined also with temperature and chemical potential, can lead to a rich phase diagram, with the emergence of multiple critical points and reentrant phase transitions. We also study how the presence of these multiple critical points and reentrant phases can manifest in the quantum Hall effect.

1306.4931,hep-ph,"We describe a region of the No-Scale F-SU(5) supersymmetric model with TeV-scale vector-like matter multiplets that is potentially opaque to LHC observations based upon top quark reconstruction.

For unboosted gluino pair-production, this could render two soft top quarks in the dominant 4-top signature, greatly reducing the likelihood for discrimination from the combinatoric background. We therefore suggest that caution is warranted when gluino exclusion bounds on models possessing a similar spectral character (gluino heavier than the light stop but lighter than all other squarks) using multijet SUSY search tactics.

Moreover, our analysis unveils additional gapped Goldstones, naturally as light as the others, but this time with a model-dependent gap. Their exact number cannot be inferred solely from the symmetry breaking pattern either, but rather depends on the details of the symmetry breaking mechanism--a statement that we explicitly verify with a number of examples.

Above the phase transition the ghost form factor remains infrared divergent but its infrared exponent is approximately halved. The gluon energy being infrared divergent in the confined phase becomes infrared finite in the deconfined phase. Furthermore, the effective potential of the order parameter for confinement is calculated for SUequation Yang-Mills theory in the Hamiltonian approach by compactifying one spatial dimension and using a background gauge fixing.

Nonetheless the low-energy effective theory proposed originally by Scherk and Schwarz is a gauged supergravity that describes supersymmetry breaking and moduli lifting for all values of the structure constants.

The bottom line is that upon expanding in powers of 1/L the energy levels of long (closed) strings (where L is the length of the string), all the terms up to (and including) order 1/L5 are universal. We argue that for excited strings in D>3 space-time dimensions there is a universal deviation at order 1/L5 from the naive formula that is usually used to fit lattice results. For D=3 this naive formula is valid even at order 1/L5. At order 1/L7 non-universal terms generically appear in all cases.

When the original CFT is that of N conformal complex scalar or fermion fields, the U(N) singlet sector of the induced 3-d gauge theory is dual to Vasiliev's theory in AdS4 with alternate boundary conditions on the spin s massless gauge field. We test this correspondence by calculating the leading term in letter F for large N. We show that the coefficient of (1/2)\log N in letter F is equal to the number of spin s-1 gauge parameters that act trivially on the spin s gauge field. We discuss generalizations of these results to 3-d gauge theories including Chern-Simons terms and to theories where s is half-integer. We also argue that the Weyl anomaly a-coefficients of conformal spin s theories in even dimensions d, such as that of the Weyl-squared gravity in d=4, can be efficiently calculated using massless spin s fields in AdSd1 with alternate boundary conditions. Using this method we derive a simple formula for the Weyl anomaly a-coefficients of the d=4 Fradkin-Tseytlin conformal higher-spin gauge fields. Similarly, using alternate boundary conditions in AdS3 we reproduce the well-known central charge c=-26 of the bc ghosts in 2-d gravity, as well as its higher-spin generalizations.",13,[],4

Our methods naturally permit us to treat certain classes of distributions (resp., measures) for the coefficients equation and equation and hence considerably extend the scope of this (generalized) eigenvalue problem, without having to change the underlying Hilbert space equation. Our approach relies on rewriting the eigenvalue problem equation in the form equation, equation, and a careful study of (appropriate realizations of) the operator equation in equation.   In the course of our treatment we employ a supersymmetric formalism which permits us to factor the second-order operator equation into a product of two first-order operators familiar from (and inspired by) Miura's transformation linking the KdV and mKdV hierarchy of nonlinear evolution equations.

An unknown subset of sensors are compromised and will send arbitrarily modified and even artificially generated signals to the control center. It is shown that the performance of the the so-called CUSUM statistic, which is optimal when all sensors are honest, will be significantly degraded in the presence of even a single dishonest sensor. In particular, instead of in a logarithmically the detection delay grows linearly with the average run length (ARL) to false alarm.

We also compare two partial characteristics of convex bodies in terms of largest balls and maximum volume ellipsoids contained in them and show that, in general, they do not coincide. Separable states, mixed-unitary channels and k-entangled states are also considered as examples of our techniques.",13,"['math', 'quant-ph']",3

1305.4473,math-ph,"Beginning with Anderson (1972), spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in infinite quantum systems is often put forward as an example of (asymptotic) emergence in physics, since in theory no finite system should display it. Even the correspondence between theory and reality is at stake here, since numerous real materials show SSB in their ground states (or equilibrium states at low temperature), although they are finite. Thus against what is sometimes called `Earman's Principle', a genuine physical effect (viz. SSB) seems theoretically recovered only in some idealization (namely the thermodynamic limit), disappearing as soon as the the idealization is removed. We review the well-known arguments that (at first sight) no finite system can exhibit SSB, using the formalism of algebraic quantum theory in order to control the thermodynamic limit and unify the description of finite- and infinite-volume systems. Using the striking mathematical analogy between the thermodynamic limit and the classical limit, we show that a similar situation obtains in quantum mechanics (which typically forbids SSB) versus classical mechanics (which allows it). This discrepancy between formalism and reality is quite similar to the measurement problem, and hence we address it in the same way, adapting an argument of the author and Reuvers (2013) that was originally intended to explain the collapse of the wave-function within conventional quantum mechanics. Namely, exponential sensitivity to (asymmetric) perturbations of the (symmetric) dynamics as the system size increases causes symmetry breaking already in finite but very large quantum systems. This provides continuity between finite- and infinite-volume descriptions of quantum systems featuring SSB and hence restores Earman's Principle (at least in this particularly threatening case).",13,['math'],3

1304.4982,math-ph,Correlation matrices are a standard tool in the analysis of the time evolution of complex systems in general and financial markets in particular. Yet most analysis assume stationarity of the underlying time series. This tends to be an assumption of varying and often dubious validity. The validity of the assumption improves as shorter time series are used. If many time series are used this implies an analysis of highly singular correlation matrices. We attack this problem by using the so called \it power map which was introduced to reduce noise. Its non-linearity breaks the degeneracy of the zero eigenvalues and we analyze the sensitivity of the so emerging spectra to correlations.

It is known that when the symmetry algebra is large enough, symmetry may fully prescribe the dynamics. However, the way this is borne out in two dimensional hydrodynamics, both classical and quantum, is not fully understood. Here we take a step in clarifying this issue, by focusing on a particular example, namely that of a two dimensional phase space liquid which emerges when one considers the Calogero model, a many-body one-dimensional system interacting through an inverse square law potential. We demonstrate how the symmetry algebra of conserved quantities of the one dimensional system is expressed in terms of the incompressible Euler hydrodynamics of point vortices in phase space.

1302.6384,math-ph,"This paper aims at advancing the field of electro-sensing. It exhibits the physical mechanism underlying shape perception for weakly electric fish. These fish orient themselves at night in complete darkness by employing their active electrolocation system. They generate a stable, high-frequency, weak electric field and perceive the transdermal potential modulations caused by a nearby target with different admittivity than the surrounding water. In this paper, we explain how weakly electric fish might identify and classify a target, knowing by advance that the latter belongs to a certain collection of shapes. Our model of the weakly electric fish relies on differential imaging, i.e., by forming an image from the perturbations of the field due to targets, and physics-based classification. The electric fish would first locate the target using a specific location search algorithm. Then it could extract, from the perturbations of the electric field, generalized (or high-order) polarization tensors of the target. Computing, from the extracted features, invariants under rigid motions and scaling yields shape descriptors. The weakly electric fish might classify a target by comparing its invariants with those of a set of learned shapes. On the other hand, when measurements are taken at multiple frequencies, the fish might exploit the shifts and use the spectral content of the generalized polarization tensors to dramatically improve the stability with respect to measurement noise of the classification procedure in electro-sensing. Surprisingly, it turns out that the first-order polarization tensor at multiple frequencies could be enough for the purpose of classification. A procedure to eliminate the background field in the case where the permittivity of the surrounding medium can be neglected, and hence improve further the stability of the classification process, is also discussed.",13,['math'],3

The weight however is non-standard and can be expressed in terms of the Meijer G-function. The explicit knowledge of all eigenvalue correlation functions and the corresponding kernel allows us to take various large equation (and equation) limits at fixed equation. At strong non-unitarity, with equation finite, the eigenvalues condense on a domain inside the unit circle. At the edge and in the bulk we find the same universal microscopic kernel as for a single complex non-Hermitian matrix from the Ginibre ensemble. At the origin we find the same new universality classes labelled by equation as for the product of equation matrices from the Ginibre ensemble. Keeping a fixed size of truncation, equation, when equation goes to infinity leads to weak non-unitarity, with most eigenvalues on the unit circle as for unitary matrices.

As a result comes the supersymmetric trivialization of the so-called sharp trace and sharp determinant of the GTO, with the former being the Witten index, which is also the stochastic generalization of the Lefschetz index so that it equals the Euler characteristic of the (closed) phase space for any flow vector field, noise metric, and temperature. The enabled possibility to apply the spectral theorems of the DS theory to the Fokker-Planck operators allows to extend the previous picture of the spontaneous topological supersymmetry (Q-symmetry) breaking onto the situations with negative ground state's attenuation rate. The later signifies the exponential growth of the number of periodic solutions/orbits in the large time limit, which is the unique feature of chaotic behavior proving that the spontaneous breakdown of Q-symmetry is indeed the field-theoretic definition and stochastic generalization of the concept of deterministic chaos. In addition, the previously proposed low-temperature classification of SDEs, i.e., thermodynamic equilibrium / noise-induced chaos ((anti)instanton condensation, intermittent) / ordinary chaos (non-integrability of the flow vector field), is complemented by the discussion of the high-temperature regime where the sharp boundary between the noise-induced and ordinary chaotic phases must smear out into a crossover, and at even higher temperatures the Q-symmetry is restored.

For each isolated family of magnetic Bloch bands we derive an effective Hamiltonian that is unitarily equivalent to the restriction of the Schrodinger operator to a corresponding almost invariant subspace. At leading order, our effective Hamiltonian can be interpreted as the Peierls substitution Hamiltonian widely used in physics for non-magnetic Bloch bands. However, while for non-magnetic Bloch bands the corresponding result is well understood, for magnetic Bloch bands it is not clear how to even define a Peierls substitution Hamiltonian beyond a formal expression. The source of the difficulty is a topological obstruction: magnetic Bloch bundles are generically not trivializable. As a consequence, Peierls substitution Hamiltonians for magnetic Bloch bands turn out to be pseudodifferential operators acting on sections of non-trivial vector bundles over a two-torus, the reduced Brillouin zone. Part of our contribution is the construction of a suitable Weyl calculus for such pseudos. As an application of our results we construct a new family of canonical one-band Hamiltonians equation for magnetic Bloch bands with Chern number equation that generalizes the Hofstadter model equation for a single non-magnetic Bloch band. It turns out that equation is isospectral to equation for any equation and all spectra agree with the Hofstadter spectrum depicted in his famous black and white butterfly. However, the resulting Chern numbers of subbands, corresponding to Hall conductivities, depend on equation and equation, and thus the models lead to different colored butterflies.",13,"['math', 'quant-ph']",3

The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Cartan matrix are used to determine the set of orthonormal vectors in nD Euclidean space which lead suitable choices for the projection subspaces. The maximal dihedral subgroup of the Coxeter-Weyl group is identified to determine the symmetry of the quasicrystal structure.

The action in this case is an integral of a differential form over a surface in phase space.

By introducing an auxiliary parameter (denoted by equation), whose flow corresponds to the so-called squared eigenfunction symmetry of KP hierarchy, we find the tau-function for this extended KP hierarchy. It is shown that the bilinear identities will generate all the Hirota's bilinear equations for the zero-curvature forms of the extended KP hierarchy, which includes two types of KP equation with self-consistent sources (KPSCS).

1312.4256,nlin,"This is a review of the theory of the modulational instability in idealised fluid models of strongly magnetised plasmas and reduced models of geophysical fluid dynamics, particularly the role it plays in the formation of zonal flows. The discussion focusses on the Charney-Hasegawa-Mima and Hasegawa-Wakatani models. Particular attention is paid to the wave turbulence - zonal flow feedback loop whereby large scale zonal flows which are initially generated by modulational instability of small-scale drift/Rossby waves tend to subsequently suppress these small scale waves by their shearing action. This negative feedback can result in a dynamic equilibrium in which large scale zonal flows grow by drawing energy from small scale turbulence but suppress the small scale turbulence in the process until a balance is reached. In this regime, the level of small scale turbulence is greatly reduced compared to the level one would observe in the absence of the zonal flows.",13,['physics'],9

Based on this information, we design agent-level hybrid control policies that leverage the surrounding fluid dynamics and inherent environmental noise to enable the team to maintain a desired distribution in the workspace. We establish the stability properties of the ensemble dynamics of the distributed control policies. Since realistic quasi-geostrophic ocean models predict double-gyre flow solutions, we use a wind-driven multi-gyre flow model to verify the feasibility of the proposed distributed control strategy and compare the proposed control strategy with a baseline deterministic allocation strategy. Lastly, we validate the control strategy using actual flow data obtained by our coherent structure experimental testbed.",13,[],9

Based on the value of the frequency of the forcing function relative to the cutoff frequency, the system can be categorized by the presence and magnitude of each type of DRT. Furthermore, we investigate and quantify how varying additional parameters such as the biharmonic weight affects DRT velocity and magnitude.

In rocking ratchets the asymmetry is induced through a proper choice of external forces and modulations of nonlinear symmetric potentials. The ratchet currents thus obtained in systems as different as semiconductors, Josephson junctions, optical lattices, or ferrofluids, show a set of universal features. A satisfactory explanation for them has challenged theorist for decades, and so far we still lack a general theory of this phenomenon. Here we provide such a theory by exploring ---through functional analysis--- the constraints that the simple assumption of time-shift invariance of the ratchet current imposes on its dependence on the external drivings. Because the derivation is based on so general a principle, the resulting expression is valid irrespective of the details and the nature of the physical systems to which it is applied, and of whether they are classical, quantum, or stochastic. The theory also explains deviations observed from universality under special conditions, and allows to make predictions of phenomena not yet observed in any experiment or simulation.",13,['cond-mat'],9

Via a multi-scale expansion, we derived a longwave, strongly nonlinear, and strongly anisotropic evolution PDE for the step profile. Written in terms of the step slope, the PDE can be represented in the form similar to a convective Cahn-Hilliard equation. We performed the linear stability analysis and computed the nonlinear dynamics. Linear stability depends on whether the stiffness is minimum or maximum in the direction of the step growth. It also depends nontrivially on the combination of the anisotropy strength parameter and the atomic flux from the terrace to the step. Computations show formation and coarsening of a hill-and-valley structure superimposed onto a large-wavelength profile, which independently coarsens.

Stationary propagation of the front is accompanied by formation of a non-stationary oscillatory tail with complicated internal structure. We demonstrate that the structure of the oscillatory tail is related to a relationship between phase and group velocities of the oscillations. We suggest also an approximate analytic procedure, which allows one to determine all basic characteristics of the propagation process: velocity and width of the front, frequency and amplitude of the after-front oscillations, as well as the structure of the oscillatory tail.

We discuss that, for a finite length, maximum Lempel-Ziv sequences can be built from a well defined generating algorithm, which makes them of low Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity, quite the opposite to randomness. It will be discussed that Lempel-Ziv measure is, in this sense, less general than Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity, as it can be fooled by an intelligent enough agent. The latter will be shown to be the case for the binary expansion of certain irrational numbers. Maximum Lempel-Ziv sequences induce a normalization that gives good estimates of entropy rate for several sources, while keeping bounded values for all sequence length, making it an alternative to other normalization schemes in use.",13,"['cs', 'math']",9

More generally, we urge future researchers to exercise caution in the use of advanced mathematical tools such as nonlinear dynamics and in particular to verify that the elementary conditions for their valid application have been met.",13,"['math', 'physics']",9

1311.6347,nucl-th,"The shear viscosity of the quark-gluon plasma is predicted to be lower than the collisional viscosity for weak coupling. The estimated ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density is rather close to the ratio calculated by N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory for strong coupling, which indicates that the quark-gluon plasma might be strongly coupled. However, in presence of momentum anisotropy, the Weibel instability can arise and drive the turbulent transport. Shear viscosity can be lowered by enhanced collisionality due to turbulence, but the decorrelation time and its relation to underlying dynamics and color-magnetic fields have not been calculated self-consistently. In this paper, we use resonance broadening theory for strong turbulence to calculate the anomalous viscosity of the quark-gluon plasma for nonequilibrium. For saturated Weibel instability, we estimate the scalings of the decorrelation rate and viscosity and compare these with collisional transport. This calculation yields an explicit connection between the underlying momentum space anisotropy and the viscosity anomaly.",13,[],11

1306.2368,nucl-th,"We study vector meson photoproduction from the deuteron at high momentum transfer, accompanied by break-up of the deuteron into a proton and neutron. The large equation involved allows one of the nucleons to be identified as struck, and the other as a spectator to the equation subprocess. Corrections to the plane wave impulse approximation involve final state interactions (FSIs) between the struck nucleon or the vector meson, either of which is energetic, with the slow spectator nucleon. In this regime, the eikonal approximation is valid, so is employed to calculate the cross-section for the reaction. Due to the high-energy nature of the FSIs, the maxima of the rescatterings are located at nearly transverse directions of the fast hadrons. This results in two peaks in the angular distribution of the spectator nucleon, each corresponding to either the equation-equation or the equation-equation rescattering. The equation-equation peak provides a new means of probing the equation-equation interaction. This is checked for near-threshold equation and equation photoproduction reactions which demonstrate that the equation-equation peak can be used to extract the largely unknown amplitudes of equation-equation and equation-equation interactions.   Two additional phenomena are observed when extending the calculation of equation photoproduction to the sub-threshold and high-energy domains. In the first case we observe overall suppression of FSI effects due to a restricted phase space for sub-threshold production in the rescattering amplitude.

Terms of second order in Knudsen number give rise to non-hyperbolic (and thus acausal) behavior and must be neglected in (numerical) solutions of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics. The coefficients of the terms which are of the order of the product of Knudsen and inverse Reynolds numbers have been explicitly computed in the above reference, in the limit of a massless Boltzmann gas. Terms of second order in inverse Reynolds number arise from the collision term in the Boltzmann equation, upon expansion to second order in deviations from the single-particle distribution function in local thermodynamical equilibrium. In this work, we compute these second-order terms for a massless Boltzmann gas with constant scattering cross section. Consequently, we assess their relative importance in comparison to the terms which are of the order of the product of Knudsen and inverse Reynolds numbers.",13,"['hep-ph', 'physics']",11

Indeed, nuclear matter traditionally addressed by mean-field models is uniform while clusters are known to exist in the dilute baryonic matter which constitutes the main component of compact objects outer shells. In the present work we investigate the meaning of symmetry energy in the case of clusterized systems and the sensitivity of the proto-neutron star composition and equation of state to the effective interaction. To this aim an improved Nuclear Statistical Equilibrium (NSE) model is developed, where the same effective interaction is consistently used to determine the clusters and unbound particles energy functionals in the self-consistent mean-field approximation. In the same framework, in-medium modifications to the cluster energies due to the presence of the nuclear gas are evaluated. We show that the excluded volume effect does not exhaust the in-medium effects and an extra isospin and density dependent energy shift has to be considered to consistently determine the composition of subsaturation stellar matter.

These PSD transfer functions relate the PSDs of the respective measurements to the PSDs of the noisy input currents. With homogeneously distributed input currents across the neuronal membrane we find that all PSD transfer functions express asymptotic high-frequency 1/falpha power laws.

But in some cases, as for the nocturnal planetary boundary layer, a stable and well-ordered flow can develop intense and sporadic bursts of turbulent activity which disappear slowly in time. This phenomenon is ill-understood and poorly modeled; and yet, it is central to our understanding of weather and climate dynamics. We present here a simple model which shows that in stably stratified turbulence, the stronger bursts can occur when the flow is expected to be more stable. The bursts are generated by a rapid non-linear amplification of energy stored in waves, and are associated with energetic interchanges between vertical velocity and temperature (or density) fluctuations. Direct numerical simulations on grids of 20483 points confirm this somewhat paradoxical result of measurably stronger events for more stable flows, displayed not only in the temperature and vertical velocity derivatives, but also in the amplitude of the fields themselves.",13,[],5
1307.2201,physics,"This paper is concerned with a way of thinking about the standard model that explains the existence of three fermion families and the value of the fine structure constant. The main idea is that the ultraviolet divergences that we encounter in the quantum field theories of the standard model, when interpreted appropriately, have a deep physical significance that leads to new relationships between the physical and bare masses quarks and leptons. This interpretation is based on the assumption of a quantum gravity induced ultraviolet cutoff at the Planck scale and a novel approach to mass renormalization in which the usual perturbation series for the self-mass of a quark or lepton is rearranged and formally summed. Perturbing around the formally summed expression leads to self-consistency equations for the physical quark and lepton masses with multiple solutions that lie outside the reach of conventional perturbation theory. When applied to the standard model at the lowest level of approximation, this approach explains how three generations of charged leptons with a mass spectrum and a value of the fine structure constant in rough agreement with experiment can emerge from a universal bare mass and bare electromagnetic charge. This approach also explains how three generations of physical quark doublets (six flavors) can emerge from a universal bare doublet and bare color charge. Finally, it explains the origin of mixing (and CP violation) and the absence of flavor-changing neutral currents.",13,['hep-ph'],5
1305.6809,physics,"In this work we define single-particle potentials for a positron and a positronium atom interacting with light atoms (H, He, Li and Be) by inverting a single-particle Schrodinger equation. For this purpose, we use accurate energies and positron densities obtained from the many-body wavefunction of the corresponding positronic systems. The introduced potentials describe the exact correlations for the calculated systems including the formation of a positronium atom. We show that the scattering lengths and the low-energy s-wave phase shifts from accurate many-body calculations are well accounted for by the introduced potential. We also calculate self-consistent two-component density-functional theory positron potentials and densities for the bound positronic systems within the local density approximation. They are in a very good agreement with the many-body results, provided that the finite-positron-density electron-positron correlation potential is used, and they can also describe systems comprising a positronium atom. We argue that the introduced single-particle positron potentials defined for single molecules are transferable to the condensed phase when the inter-molecular interactions are weak. When this condition is fulfilled, the total positron potential can be constructed in a good approximation as the superposition of the molecular potentials.",13,['cond-mat'],5
1310.6316,physics,"The theoretical and experimental study of energy transfer in photosynthesis has revealed an interesting transport regime, which lies at the borderline between classical transport dynamics and quantum-mechanical interference effects. Dissipation is caused by the coupling of electronic degrees of freedom to vibrational modes and leads to a directional energy transfer from the antenna complex to the target reaction-center. The dissipative driving is robust and does not rely on fine-tuning of specific vibrational modes. For the parameter regime encountered in the biological systems new theoretical tools are required to directly compare theoretical results with experimental spectroscopy data. The calculations require to utilize massively parallel graphics processor units (GPUs) for efficient and exact computations.",13,[],5
1303.5683,physics,"A composite impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) communication system is presented. The proposed system model aims to transmit UWB pulses over several kilometers through free-space optical (FSO) links and depending on the link design, the electrical estimates of the FSO system can be directly used or distributed to end-user through radio-frequency (RF) links over short ranges. However, inhomogeneities on the FSO transmission path cause random fluctuations in the received signal intensity and these effects induced by atmospheric turbulence closely effect the system performance. Several distinct probability distributions based on experimental measurements are used to characterize FSO channels and using these probabilistic models, detection error probability analysis of the proposed system for different link designs are carried out under weak, moderate and strong turbulence conditions. The results of the analysis show that depending on the atmospheric conditions, system performance of the composite link can have high error floors due to the false estimates of FSO link. The system performance can be improved by employing error control coding techniques. One simple solution employing a convolutional encoder and Viterbi decoder pair is also analyzed in this thesis. Another important system parameter that is the average channel capacity of the FSO system is analyzed under weak and moderate turbulence conditions. Theoretical derivations that are verified via simulation results indicate a reliable high data rate communication system that is effective in long distances.",13,[],5

However, the performance requirements on TPC for new high-rate particle experiments greatly exceed the abilities of traditional TPC read out by multi-wire proportional chamber (MWPC). Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detector has great potential to improve TPC performances when used as amplification device.

1301.1829,physics,"Molecular dynamics simulation is utilized to investigate the ionic transport of NaCl in solution through a graphene nanopore under an applied electric field. Results show the formation of concentration polarization layers in the vicinity of the graphene sheet. The non-uniformity of the ion distribution gives rise to an electric pressure which drives vortical motions in the fluid if the electric field is sufficiently strong to overcome the influence of viscosity and thermal fluctuations. The relative importance of hydrodynamic transport and thermal fluctuations in determining the pore conductivity is investigated. A second important effect that is observed is the mass transport of water through the nanopore, with an average velocity proportional to the applied voltage and independent of the pore diameter. The flux arises as a consequence of the asymmetry in the ion distribution with respect to reflection about the plane of the graphene sheet. The accumulation of liquid molecules in the vicinity of the nanopore due to reorientation of the water dipoles by the local electric field is seen to result in a local increasein the liquid density. Results confirm that the electric conductance is proportional to the nanopore diameter for the parameter regimes that we simulated. The occurrence of fluid vortices is found to result in an increase in the effective electrical conductance.",13,['q-bio'],5

1307.0912,physics,"We review the literature on the gender gap on concept inventories in physics. Across studies of the most commonly used mechanics concept inventories, the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) and Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation (FMCE), mens average pretest scores are always higher than womens, and in most cases mens posttest scores are higher as well. The weighted average gender difference on these tests is 13% for pretest scores, 12% for posttest scores, and 6% for normalized gain. This difference is much smaller than the average difference in normalized gain between traditional lecture and interactive engagement (25%), but it is large enough that it could impact the results of studies comparing the effectiveness of different teaching methods. There is sometimes a gender gap on commonly used electromagnetism concept inventories, but it is usually much smaller and sometimes is zero or favors women. The weighted average gender difference on these tests is 3.7% for pretest scores, 8.5% for posttest scores, and 6% for normalized gain. Based on our analysis of 26 published articles, no single factor is sufficient to explain the gap. Several high-profile studies that have claimed to account for or reduce the gender gap have failed to be replicated in subsequent studies, suggesting that isolated claims of explanations of the gender gap should be interpreted with caution. Other factors, such as gender differences in background preparation, scores on different kinds of assessment, and splits between how students respond to test questions when answering for themselves or for a scientist do contribute to a difference between male and female responses, but the size of these differences is smaller than the size of the overall gender gap, suggesting that the gender gap is most likely due to the combination of many small factors rather than any one factor that can easily be modified.",13,[],5

1307.0131,physics,"Cells of almost all solid tissues are connected with gap junctions which permit the direct transfer of ions and small molecules, integral to regulating coordinated function in the tissue. The pancreatic islets of Langerhans are responsible for secreting the hormone insulin in response to glucose stimulation. Gap junctions are the only electrical contacts between the beta-cells in the tissue of these excitable islets. It is generally believed that they are responsible for synchrony of the membrane voltage oscillations among beta-cells, and thereby pulsatility of insulin secretion. Most attempts to understand connectivity in islets are often interpreted, bottom-up, in terms of measurements of gap junctional conductance. This does not, however explain systematic changes, such as a diminished junctional conductance in type 2 diabetes. We attempt to address this deficit via the model presented here, which is a learning theory of gap junctional adaptation derived with analogy to neural systems. Here, gap junctions are modelled as bonds in a beta-cell network, that are altered according to homeostatic rules of plasticity. Our analysis reveals that it is nearly impossible to view gap junctions as homogeneous across a tissue. A modified view that accommodates heterogeneity of junction strengths in the islet can explain why, for example, a loss of gap junction conductance in diabetes is necessary for an increase in plasma insulin levels following hyperglycemia.",13,['q-bio'],5

1307.0274,physics,"The study of the gravitational redshift\,---\,a relative wavelength increase of equation was predicted for solar radiation by Einstein in 1908\,---\,is still an important subject in modern physics. In a dispute whether or not atom interferometry experiments can be employed for gravitational redshift measurements, two research teams have recently disagreed on the physical cause of the shift. Regardless of any discussion on the interferometer aspect\,---\,we find that both groups of authors miss the important point that the ratio of gravitational to the electrostatic forces is generally very small. For instance, the gravitational force acting on an electron in a hydrogen atom situated in the Sun's photosphere to the electrostatic force between the proton and the electron is approximately equation. A comparison of this ratio with the predicted and observed solar redshift indicates a discrepancy of many orders of magnitude. Here we show, with Einstein's early assumption of the frequency of spectral lines depending only on the generating ion itself as starting point, that a solution can be formulated based on a two-step process in analogy with Fermi's treatment of the Doppler effect. It provides a sequence of physical processes in line with the conservation of energy and momentum resulting in the observed shift and does not employ a geometric description. The gravitational field affects the release of the photon and not the atomic transition. The control parameter is the speed of light. The atomic emission is then contrasted with the gravitational redshift of matter-antimatter annihilation events.",13,[],5
1302.1498,physics,"Ninety years ago, in 1922, Alexander Friedman (1888-1925) demonstrated for the first time that the General Relativity equations admit non-static solutions and thus the Universe may expand, contract, collapse, and even be born. The fundamental equations he derived still provide the basis for the current cosmological theories of the Big Bang and the Accelerating Universe. Later, in 1924, he was the first to realize that General Relativity allows the Universe to be infinite. Friedman's ideas initially met strong resistance from Einstein, yet from 1931 he became their staunchest supporter. This essay connects Friedman's cosmological ideas with the 1998-2004 results of the astronomical observations that led to the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. It also describes Friedman's little known topological ideas of how to check General Relativity in practice and compares his contributions to those of Georges Lemaitre.

1309.4862,physics,"The scaling exponent of a hierarchy of cities used to be regarded as a fractal parameter. The Pareto exponent was treated as the fractal dimension of size distribution of cities, while the Zipf exponent was treated as the reciprocal of the fractal dimension. However, this viewpoint is not exact. In this paper, I will present a new interpretation of the scaling exponent of rank-size distributions. The ideas from fractal measure relation and the principle of dimension consistency are employed to explore the essence of Pareto's and Zipf's scaling exponents. The Pareto exponent proved to be a ratio of the fractal dimension of a network of cities to the average dimension of city population. Accordingly, the Zipf exponent is the reciprocal of this dimension ratio. On a digital map, the Pareto exponent can be defined by the scaling relation between a map scale and the corresponding number of cities based on this scale. The cities of the United States of America in 1900, 1940, 1960, and 1980 and Indian cities in 1981, 1991, and 2001 are utilized to illustrate the geographical spatial meaning of Pareto's exponent. The results suggest that the Pareto exponent of city-size distribution is not a fractal dimension, but a ratio of the urban network dimension to the city population dimension.

1305.5215,physics,"Though three distinct wounding mechanisms (permanent cavity, temporary cavity, and ballistic pressure wave) are described in the wound ballistics literature, they all have their physical origin in the retarding force between bullet and tissue as the bullet penetrates. If the bullet path is the same, larger retarding forces produce larger wounding effects and a greater probability of rapid incapacitation. By Newton's third law, the force of the bullet on the tissue is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force of the tissue on the bullet. For bullets penetrating with constant mass, the retarding force on the bullet can be determined by frame by frame analysis of high speed video of the bullet penetrating a suitable tissue simulant such as calibrated 10% ballistic gelatin. Here the technique is demonstrated with 9mm NATO bullets, 32 cm long blocks of gelatin, and a high speed video camera operating at 20,000 frames per second. It is found that different 9mm NATO bullets have a wide variety of potential for wounding and rapid incapacitation. This technique also determines the energy transfer in the first 15 cm and/or first 30 cm of tissue, which are important parameters in estimating the probability of rapid incapacitation in some of the ARL/BRL models. This method predicts that some 9mm bullets have a much higher probability of rapid incapacitation than others and the rank ordering of bullet effectiveness is in agreement with other studies.",13,[],5

We illustrate these ideas using one of the simplest models of an electron-proton multi-fluid plasma for the case where there is no magnetic field or a constant normal magnetic field present. We show that the travelling waves can be reduced to a single first order differential equation governing the dynamics. We also show that the equations admit a multi-symplectic Hamiltonian formulation in which both the space and time variables can act as the evolution variable. An integral equation useful for calculating adiabatic, electrostatic solitary wave signatures for multi-fluid plasmas with arbitrary mass ratios is presented. The integral equation arises naturally from a fluid dynamics approach for a two fluid plasma, with a given mass ratio of the two species (e.g. the plasma could be an electron proton or an electron positron plasma). Besides its intrinsic interest, the integral equation solution provides a useful analytical test for numerical codes that include a proton-electron mass ratio as a fundamental constant, such as for particle in cell (PIC) codes.

1301.5747,physics,"We apply renormalized entropy as a complexity measure to the logistic and sine-circle maps. In the case of logistic map, renormalized entropy decreases (increases) until the accumulation point (after the accumulation point up to the most chaotic state) as a sign of increasing (decreasing) degree of order in all the investigated periodic windows, namely, period-2, 3, and 5, thereby proving the robustness of this complexity measure. This observed change in the renormalized entropy is adequate, since the bifurcations are exhibited before the accumulation point, after which the band-merging, in opposition to the bifurcations, is exhibited. In addition to the precise detection of the accumulation points in all these windows, it is shown that the renormalized entropy can detect the self-similar windows in the chaotic regime by exhibiting abrupt changes in its values. Regarding the sine-circle map, we observe that the renormalized entropy detects also the quasi-periodic regimes by showing oscillatory behavior particularly in these regimes. Moreover, the oscillatory regime of the renormalized entropy corresponds to a larger interval of the nonlinearity parameter of the sine-circle map as the value of the frequency ratio parameter reaches the critical value, at which the winding ratio attains the golden mean.",13,"['cond-mat', 'nlin']",5
1312.6338,physics,"The Adaptive Two-Regime Method (ATRM) is developed for hybrid (multiscale) stochastic simulation of reaction-diffusion problems. It efficiently couples detailed Brownian dynamics simulations with coarser lattice-based models. The ATRM is a generalization of the previously developed Two-Regime Method [Flegg et al, Journal of the Royal Society Interface, 2012] to multiscale problems which require a dynamic selection of regions where detailed Brownian dynamics simulation is used. Typical applications include a front propagation or spatio-temporal oscillations. In this paper, the ATRM is used for an in-depth study of front propagation in a stochastic reaction-diffusion system which has its mean-field model given in terms of the Fisher equation [Fisher, Annals of Eugenics, 1937]. It exhibits a travelling reaction front which is sensitive to stochastic fluctuations at the leading edge of the wavefront. Previous studies into stochastic effects on the Fisher wave propagation speed have focused on lattice-based models, but there has been limited progress using off-lattice (Brownian dynamics) models, which suffer due to their high computational cost, particularly at the high molecular numbers that are necessary to approach the Fisher mean-field model. By modelling only the wavefront itself with the off-lattice model, it is shown that the ATRM leads to the same Fisher wave results as purely off-lattice models, but at a fraction of the computational cost. The error analysis of the ATRM is also presented for a morphogen gradient model.",13,['q-bio'],5

1312.7812,physics,"The so-called Localized Waves (LW), and the ""Frozen Waves"" (FW), have arisen significant attention in the areas of Optics and Ultrasound, because of their surprising energy localization properties. The LWs resist the effects of diffraction for large distances, and possess an interesting self-reconstruction (self-healing) property, after obstacles with size smaller than the antenna's; while the FWs, a sub-class of theirs, offer the possibility of arbitrarily modeling the field longitudinal intensity pattern inside a prefixed interval, for instance 0 < z < L, of the wave propagation axis. More specifically, the FWs are localized fields ""at rest"", that is, with a static envelope (within which only the carrier wave propagates), and can be endowed moreover with a high transverse localization. In this paper we investigate by simulated experiments, various cases of generation of ultrasonic FW fields, with frequency fo = 1 MHz in a water-like medium, taking account of the effects of attenuation. We present results of FWs for distances up to L=80 mm, in attenuating media with absorption coefficients alpha in the range 70 < alpha < 170 dB/m. Such simulated FW fields are constructed by using a procedure developed by us, via appropriate finite superpositions of monochromatic ultrasonic Bessel beams. We pay due attention to the selection of the FW parameters, constrained by the tight restrictions imposed by experimental Acoustics, and to some practical implications of the transducer design. The energy localization properties of the Frozen Waves can find application even in many medical apparatus, such as bistouries or acoustic tweezers, and for treatment of diseased tissues (in particular, for the destruction of tumor cells, without affecting the surrounding tissues; besides for a safe kidney stone shuttering, etcetera).",13,[],5
1310.6201,physics,"The mechanical properties of PC12 living cells have been studied at the nanoscale with a Force Feedback Microscope using two experimental approaches. Firstly, the local mechanical impedance of the cell membrane has been mapped simultaneously to the cell morphology at constant force. As the force of the interaction is gradually increased, we observed the appearance of the sub-membrane cytoskeleton. We shall compare the results obtained with this method with the measurement of other existing techniques. Secondly, a spectroscopic investigation has been performed varying the indentation of the tip in the cell membrane and consequently the force applied on it. In contrast with conventional dynamic atomic force microscopy techniques, here the small oscillation amplitude of the tip is not necessarily imposed at the cantilever first eigenmode. This allows the user to arbitrarily choose the excitation frequency in developing spectroscopic AFM techniques. The mechanical response of the PC12 cell membrane is found to be frequency dependent in the 1 kHz - 10 kHz range. The damping coefficient is reproducibly observed to decrease when the excitation frequency is increased.",13,[],5

1305.6228,physics,"Agglomerative clustering is a well established strategy for identifying communities in networks. Communities are successively merged into larger communities, coarsening a network of actors into a more manageable network of communities. The order in which merges should occur is not in general clear, necessitating heuristics for selecting pairs of communities to merge. We describe a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on a local optimality property. For each edge in the network, we associate the modularity change for merging the communities it links. For each community vertex, we call the preferred edge that edge for which the modularity change is maximal. When an edge is preferred by both vertices that it links, it appears to be the optimal choice from the local viewpoint. We use the locally optimal edges to define the algorithm: simultaneously merge all pairs of communities that are connected by locally optimal edges that would increase the modularity, redetermining the locally optimal edges after each step and continuing so long as the modularity can be further increased. We apply the algorithm to model and empirical networks, demonstrating that it can efficiently produce high-quality community solutions. We relate the performance and implementation details to the structure of the resulting community hierarchies. We additionally consider a complementary local clustering algorithm, describing how to identify overlapping communities based on the local optimality condition.",13,"['cond-mat', 'cs']",5

Some theories were suggested deriving the Anderson formula or a similar one. The recent two Earth flybys of the spacecraft Rosetta showed no measurable anomaly, although the Anderson formula predicted distinct effects for both flybys. The Busack formula predicted the null results, so the notion of a possibly correct formula or of an error of the older measuring software was supported. The forthcoming Earth flyby of Juno gives a good opportunity to decide this question or give rise to enhanced theory, because the orbit parameters are very similar to earlier flybys with notable effects.

1308.3290,physics,"This paper puts forth a coarse grid projection (CGP) multiscale method to accelerate computations of quasigeostrophic (QG) models for large scale ocean circulation. These models require solving an elliptic sub-problem at each time step, which takes the bulk of the computational time. The method we propose here is a modular approach that facilitates data transfer with simple interpolations and uses black-box solvers for solving the elliptic sub-problem and potential vorticity equations in the QG flow solvers. After solving the elliptic sub-problem on a coarsened grid, an interpolation scheme is used to obtain the fine data for subsequent time stepping on the full grid. The potential vorticity field is then updated on the fine grid with savings in computational time due to the reduced number of grid points for the elliptic solver. The method is applied to both single layer barotropic and two-layer stratified QG ocean models for mid-latitude oceanic basins in the beta plane, which are standard prototypes of more realistic ocean dynamics. The method is found to accelerate these computations while retaining the same level of accuracy in the fine-resolution field. A linear acceleration rate is obtained for all the cases we consider due to the efficient linear-cost fast Fourier transform based elliptic solver used. We expect the speed-up of the CGP method to increase dramatically for versions of the method that use other, suboptimal, elliptic solvers, which are generally quadratic cost. It is also demonstrated that numerical oscillations due to lower grid resolutions, in which the Munk scales are not resolved adequately, are effectively eliminated with CGP method.",13,[],5

In this paper we explore the possibility to go well beyond such nominal peak current level. In order to illustrate the potential of the European XFEL accelerator complex we consider a bunch with 0.25 nC charge, compressed up to a peak current of 45 kA. An advantage of operating at such high peak current is the increase of the x-ray output peak power without any modification to the baseline design. Based on start-to-end simulations, we demonstrate that such high peak current, combined with undulator tapering, allows one to achieve up to a 100-fold increase in a peak power in the conventional SASE regime, compared to the nominal mode of operation. In particular, we find that 10 TW-power level, femtosecond x-ray pulses can be generated in the photon energy range between 3 keV and 5 keV, which is optimal for single biomolecule imaging. Our simulations are based on the exploitation of all the 21 cells foreseen for the SASE3 undulator beamline, and indicate that one can achieve diffraction to the desired resolution with 15 mJ (corresponding to about 3e13 photons) in pulses of about 3 fs, in the case of a 100 nm focus at the photon energy of 3.5 keV.",13,[],5

1306.5075,q-bio,"Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) is widely used to assess the presence of long-range temporal correlations in time series. Signals with long-range temporal correlations are typically defined as having a power law decay in their autocorrelation function. The output of DFA is an exponent, which is the slope obtained by linear regression of a log-log fluctuation plot against window size. However, if this fluctuation plot is not linear, then the underlying signal is not self-similar, and the exponent has no meaning. There is currently no method for assessing the linearity of a DFA fluctuation plot. Here we present such a technique, called ML-DFA. We scale the DFA fluctuation plot to construct a likelihood function for a set of alternative models including polynomial, root, exponential, logarithmic and spline functions. We use this likelihood function to determine the maximum likelihood and thus to calculate values of the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria, which identify the best fit model when the number of parameters involved is taken into account and over-fitting is penalised. This ensures that, of the models that fit well, the least complicated is selected as the best fit. We apply ML-DFA to synthetic data from FARIMA processes and sine curves with DFA fluctuation plots whose form has been analytically determined, and to experimentally collected neurophysiological data.

Instead, the problem of signal detection is one of model-selection. Here we explore the use of the Bayesian odds-ratio (OR), which is the ratio of posterior probabilities of a signal-plus-noise model over a noise-only model. We demonstrate this method by applying it to simulated electroencephalographic (EEG) signals based on the P300 response, which is widely used in both Brain Computer Interface (BCI) and Brain Machine Interface (BMI) systems. The efficacy of this algorithm is demonstrated by comparing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the OR-based (logOR) filter to the usual correlation method where we find a significant improvement in P300 detection. The logOR filter promises to improve the accuracy and speed of the detection of evoked brain responses in BCI/BMI applications as well the detection of template signals in general.",13,"['physics', 'stat']",10
1312.2041,q-bio,"Modern population genetics studies typically involve genome-wide genotyping of individuals from a diverse network of ancestries. An important, unsolved problem is how to formulate and estimate probabilistic models of observed genotypes that allow for complex population structure. We formulate two general probabilistic models, and we propose computationally efficient algorithms to estimate them. First, we show how principal component analysis (PCA) can be utilized to estimate a general model that includes the well-known Pritchard-Stephens-Donnelly mixed-membership model as a special case. Noting some drawbacks of this approach, we introduce a new ""logistic factor analysis"" (LFA) framework that seeks to directly model the logit transformation of probabilities underlying observed genotypes in terms of latent variables that capture population structure. We demonstrate these advances on data from the human genome diversity panel and 1000 genomes project, where we are able to identify SNPs that are highly differentiated with respect to structure while making minimal modeling assumptions.",13,['stat'],10

1309.5033,q-bio,"Bacterial spores in a metabolically dormant state can survive long periods without nutrients under extreme environmental conditions. The molecular basis of spore dormancy is not well understood, but the distribution and physical state of water within the spore is thought to play an important role. Two scenarios have been proposed for the spore's core region, containing the DNA and most enzymes. In the gel scenario, the core is a structured macromolecular framework permeated by mobile water. In the glass scenario, the entire core, including the water, is an amorphous solid and the quenched molecular diffusion accounts for the spore's dormancy and thermal stability. Here, we use equationH magnetic relaxation dispersion to selectively monitor water mobility in the core of Bacillus subtilis spores in the presence and absence of core Mnequation ions. We also report and analyze the solid-state equationH NMR spectrum from these spores. Our NMR data clearly support the gel scenario with highly mobile core water (~ 25 ps average rotational correlation time). Furthermore, we find that the large depot of manganese in the core is nearly anhydrous, with merely 1.7 % on average of the maximum sixfold water coordination.",13,['physics'],10

A major component of identifiability analysis is determining the identifiable parameter combinations, the functional forms for the dependencies between unidentifiable parameters. Identifiable combinations can help in model reparameterization and also in determining which parameters may be experimentally measured to recover model identifiability. Several numerical approaches to determining identifiability of differential equation models have been developed, however the question of determining identifiable combinations remains incompletely addressed. In this paper, we present a new approach which uses parameter subset selection methods based on the Fisher Information Matrix, together with the profile likelihood, to effectively estimate identifiable combinations.

1302.0255,q-bio,"Understanding models which represent the invasion of network-based systems by infectious agents can give important insights into many real-world situations, including the prevention and control of infectious diseases and computer viruses. Here we consider Markovian susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) dynamics on finite strongly connected networks, applicable to several sexually transmitted diseases and computer viruses. In this context, a theoretical definition of endemic prevalence is easily obtained via the quasi-stationary distribution (QSD). By representing the model as a percolation process and utilising the property of duality, we also provide a theoretical definition of invasion probability. We then show that, for undirected networks, the probability of invasion from any given individual is equal to the (probabilistic) endemic prevalence, following successful invasion, at the individual (we also provide a relationship for the directed case). The total (fractional) endemic prevalence in the population is thus equal to the average invasion probability (across all individuals). Consequently, for such systems, the regions or individuals already supporting a high level of infection are likely to be the source of a successful invasion by another infectious agent. This could be used to inform targeted interventions when there is a threat from an emerging infectious disease.",13,['math'],10
1303.4981,q-bio,"Network analysis provides a powerful framework for the interpretation of genome-wide data. While static network approaches have proved fruitful, there is increasing interest in the insights gained from the analysis of cellular networks under different conditions. In this work, we study the effect of stress on cellular networks in fission yeast. Stress elicits a sophisticated and large scale cellular response, involving a shift of resources from cell growth and metabolism towards protection and maintenance. Previous work has suggested that these changes can be appreciated at the network level.   In this paper, we study two types of cellular networks: gene co-regulation networks and weighted protein interaction networks. We show that in response to oxidative stress, the co-regulation networks re-organize towards a more modularised structure: while sets of genes become more tightly co-regulated, co-regulation between these modules is decreased. This shift translates into longer average shortest path length, increased transitivity, and decreased modular overlap in these networks. We also find a similar change in structure in the weighted protein interaction network in response to both oxidative stress and nitrogen starvation, confirming and extending previous findings.   These changes in network structure could represent an increase in network robustness and/or the emergence of more specialised functional modules. Additionally, we find stress induces tighter co-regulation of non-coding RNAs, decreased functional importance of splicing factors, as well as changes in the centrality of genes involved in chromatin organization, cytoskeleton organization, cell division, and protein turnover.",13,[],10
1311.4514,q-bio,"It is now well established that the cell is a highly crowded environment. Yet, the effects of crowding on the dynamics of signaling pathways, gene regulation networks and metabolic networks are still largely unknown. Crowding can alter both molecular diffusion and the equilibria of biomolecular reactions. In this review, we first discuss how diffusion can affect biochemical networks. Diffusion of transcription factors can increase noise in gene expression, while diffusion of proteins between intracellular compartments or between cells can reduce concentration fluctuations. In push-pull networks diffusion can impede information transmission, while in multi-site protein modification networks diffusion can qualitatively change the macroscopic response of the system, such as the loss or emergence of bistability. Moreover, diffusion can directly change the metabolic flux. We describe how crowding affects diffusion, and thus how all these phenomena are influenced by crowding. Yet, a potentially more important effect of crowding on biochemical networks is mediated via the shift in the equilibria of bimolecular reactions, and we provide computational evidence that supports this idea. Finally, we discuss how the effects of crowding can be incorporated in models of biochemical networks.",13,[],10

The results suggest, in a simplified model, that the prevalence of sexual species in nature can be a natural and necessary consequence of the discrete character of the nonlinear interactions between couples and their pathogens/parasites. Mapped into a field theory, the stochastic processes performed by the species are described by continuous fields in space and time. The way that the model's parameters scale with subsequent iterations of the renormalization group gives us information about the stationary emergent properties of the complex interacting systems modeled.

It is based on the non-linear degenerate cross diffusion model proposed by Kawasaki et al. (J. of Theor. Biol. 188(2) 1997) and it includes a suitable nutrient chemotactic term compatible with such type of diffusion. High resolution numerical simulations using Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) of the new model are presented, showing that the chemotactic term enhances the velocity of propagation of the colony envelope for dense-branching morphologies. In addition, the chemotaxis seems to stabilize the formation of branches in the soft-agar, low-nutrient regime. An asymptotic estimation predicts the growth velocity of the colony envelope as a function of both the nutrient concentration and the chemotactic sensitivity. For fixed nutrient concentrations, the growth velocity is an increasing function of the chemotactic sensitivity.",13,"['nlin', 'physics']",10
1311.4843,q-bio,"Annotations of gene structures and regulatory elements can inform genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, choosing the relevant annotations for interpreting an association study of a given trait remains challenging. We describe a statistical model that uses association statistics computed across the genome to identify classes of genomic element that are enriched or depleted for loci that influence a trait. The model naturally incorporates multiple types of annotations. We applied the model to GWAS of 18 human traits, including red blood cell traits, platelet traits, glucose levels, lipid levels, height, BMI, and Crohn's disease. For each trait, we evaluated the relevance of 450 different genomic annotations, including protein-coding genes, enhancers, and DNase-I hypersensitive sites in over a hundred tissues and cell lines. We show that the fraction of phenotype-associated SNPs that influence protein sequence ranges from around 2% (for platelet volume) up to around 20% (for LDL cholesterol); that repressed chromatin is significantly depleted for SNPs associated with several traits; and that cell type-specific DNase-I hypersensitive sites are enriched for SNPs associated with several traits (for example, the spleen in platelet volume). Finally, by re-weighting each GWAS using information from functional genomics, we increase the number of loci with high-confidence associations by around 5%.",13,[],10
1308.0798,q-bio,"Very low levels of genetic diversity have been reported in vertebrates with large genomes, notably salamanders and lungfish [1-3]. Interpreting differences in heterozygosity, which reflects genetic diversity in a population, is complicated because levels of heterozygosity vary widely between conspecific populations, and correlate with many different physiological and demographic variables such as body size and effective population size. Here we return to the question of genetic variability in salamanders and report on the relationship between evolutionary rates and genome sizes in five different salamander families. We found that rates of evolution are exceptionally low in salamanders as a group. Evolutionary rates are as low as those reported for cartilaginous fish, which have the slowest rates recorded so far in vertebrates [4]. We also found that, independent of life history, salamanders with the smallest genomes (14 pg) are evolving at rates two to three times faster than salamanders with the largest genomes (>50 pg). After accounting for evolutionary duration, we conclude that more recently evolved species have correspondingly smaller genomes compared to older taxa and concomitantly higher rates of mutation and evolution.",13,[],10

1309.2618,q-bio,"Weak-signal detection and single-particle selection from low-contrast micrographs of frozen hydrated biomolecules by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) presents a practical challenge. Cryo-EM image contrast degrades as the size of biomolecules of structural interest decreases. When the image contrast falls into a range where the location or presence of single particles becomes ambiguous, a need arises for objective computational approaches to detect weak signal and to select and verify particles from these low-contrast micrographs. Here we propose an objective validation scheme for low-contrast particle selection using a combination of two different target functions. In an implementation of this dual-target function (DTF) validation, a first target function of fast local correlation was used to select particles through template matching, followed by signal validation through a second target function of maximum likelihood. By a systematic study of simulated data, we found that such an implementation of DTF validation is capable of selecting and verifying particles from cryo-EM micrographs with a signal-to-noise ratio as low as 0.002. Importantly, we demonstrated that DTF validation can robustly evade over-fitting or reference bias from the particle-picking template, allowing true signal to emerge from amidst heavy noise in an objective fashion. The DTF approach allows efficient assembly of a large number of single-particle cryo-EM images of smaller biomolecules or specimens containing contrast-degrading agents like detergents in a semi-automatic manner.",13,[],10
1305.6697,q-bio,"Alan Turing's work in Morphogenesis has received wide attention during the past 60 years. The central idea behind his theory is that two chemically interacting diffusible substances are able to generate stable spatial patterns, provided certain conditions are met. Turing's proposal has already been confirmed as a pattern formation mechanism in several chemical and biological systems and, due to their wide applicability, there is a great deal of interest in deciphering how to generate specific patterns under controlled conditions. However, techniques allowing one to predict what kind of spatial structure will emerge from Turing systems, as well as generalized reaction-diffusion systems, remain unknown. Here, we consider a generalized reaction diffusion system on a planar domain and provide an analytic criterion to determine whether spots or stripes will be formed. It is motivated by the existence of an associated energy function that allows bringing in the intuition provided by phase transitions phenomena. This criterion is proved rigorously in some situations, generalizing well known results for the scalar equation where the pattern selection process can be understood in terms of a potential. In more complex settings it is investigated numerically.

1306.4402,q-bio,"Using theoretical arguments and extensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of a coarse-grained three-dimensional off-lattice model of a letter-hairpin, we demonstrate that the equilibrium critical force, equation, needed to unfold the biopolymer increases non-linearly with increasing volume fraction occupied by the spherical macromolecular crowding agent. Both scaling arguments and MC simulations show that the critical force increases as equation. The exponent equation is linked to the Flory exponent relating the size of the unfolded state of the biopolymer and the number of amino acids. The predicted power law dependence is confirmed in simulations of the dependence of the isothermal extensibility and the fraction of native contacts on equation. We also show using MC simulations that equation is linearly dependent on the average osmotic pressure (equation) exerted by the crowding agents on the letter-hairpin. The highly significant linear correlation coefficient of 0.99657 between equation and equation makes it straightforward to predict the dependence of the critical force on the density of crowders.

However, each peptide's possibility to be detected was severely influenced by the peptide physicochemical properties, which confounded the results of MS accounting. Using about a million peptide identification generated by four different kinds of proteomic platforms, we successfully identified >16,000 proteotypic peptides.

We used the data of peptides (provides by CAS lab) to derive the best model from different kinds of methods.

In principle, it can be evaluated using known pedigrees, as IBD segments are by definition inherited without recombination down a family tree. We extracted 25,432 genotyped European individuals containing 2,952 father-mother-child trios from the 23andMe, Inc. dataset. We then used GERMLINE, a widely used IBD detection method, to detect IBD segments within this cohort. Exploiting known familial relationships, we identified a false positive rate over 67% for 2-4 centiMorgan (cM) segments, in sharp contrast with accuracies reported in simulated data at these sizes. Nearly all false positives arose from the allowance of haplotype switch errors when detecting IBD, a necessity for retrieving long (> 6 cM) segments in the presence of imperfect phasing. We introduce HaploScore, a novel, computationally efficient metric that scores IBD segments proportional to the number of switch errors they contain. Applying HaploScore filtering to the IBD data at a precision of 0.8 produced a 13-fold increase in recall when compared to length-based filtering. We replicate the false IBD findings and demonstrate the generalizability of HaploScore to alternative data sources using an independent cohort of 555 European individuals from the 1000 Genomes project. HaploScore can improve the accuracy of segments reported by any IBD detection method, provided that estimates of the genotyping error rate and switch error rate are available.",13,[],10

One can analyze neural excitability in the deterministic model by using a separation of time scales involving a fast voltage variable and a slow recovery variable, which represents the fraction of open Potassium channels. In the stochastic setting, spontaneous excitation is initiated by ion channel noise. If the recovery variable is constant during initiation, the spontaneous activity rate can be calculated using Kramer's rate theory. The validity of this assumption in the stochastic model is examined using a systematic perturbation analysis. We find that in most physically relevant cases, this assumption breaks down, requiring an alternative to Kramers theory for excitable systems with one deterministic fixed point.

1310.1853,q-bio,"We investigate the dynamics of cancer initiation in a mathematical model with one driver mutation and several passenger mutations. Our analysis is based on a multi type branching process: We model individual cells which can either divide or undergo apoptosis. In case of a cell division, the two daughter cells can mutate, which potentially confers a change in fitness to the cell. In contrast to previous models, the change in fitness induced by the driver mutation depends on the genetic context of the cell, in our case on the number of passenger mutations. The passenger mutations themselves have no or only a very small impact on the cell's fitness. While our model is not designed as a specific model for a particular cancer, the underlying idea is motivated by clinical and experimental observations in Burkitt Lymphoma. In this tumor, the hallmark mutation leads to deregulation of the MYC oncogene which increases the rate of apoptosis, but also the proliferation rate of cells. This increase in the rate of apoptosis hence needs to be overcome by mutations affecting apoptotic pathways, naturally leading to an epistatic fitness landscape. This model shows a very interesting dynamical behavior which is distinct from the dynamics of cancer initiation in the absence of epistasis. Since the driver mutation is deleterious to a cell with only a few passenger mutations, there is a period of stasis in the number of cells until a clone of cells with enough passenger mutations emerges. Only when the driver mutation occurs in one of those cells, the cell population starts to grow rapidly.",13,[],10
1311.3717,q-bio,"Metagenomics is an emerging field of molecular biology concerned with analyzing the genomes of environmental samples comprising many different diverse organisms.

In deep high-throughput sequencing experiments, the volume of the raw reads is extremely high, frequently exceeding 600 Gb. With an ever increasing demand for storing such reads for future studies, the issue of efficient metagenomic compression becomes of paramount importance. We present the first known approach to metagenome read compression, termed MCUIUC (Metagenomic Compression at UIUC). The gist of the proposed algorithm is to perform classification of reads based on unique organism identifiers, followed by reference-based alignment of reads for individually identified organisms, and metagenomic assembly of unclassified reads. Once assembly and classification are completed, lossless reference based compression is performed via positional encoding.

Temperature elevation, whether passive or through exercise, resulted in significant concentration increase of structurally transformed erythrocytes (echinocytes) and vesicles in blood.

Thermodynamic analysis of experimental and literature data showed that erythrocyte transformation, vesicle release and other associated processes are driven by entropy with enthalpy-entropy compensation.

1301.5948,q-bio,"Practical application of genomic-based risk stratification to clinical diagnosis is appealing yet performance varies widely depending on the disease and genomic risk score (GRS) method. Celiac disease (CD), a common immune-mediated illness, is strongly genetically determined and requires specific HLA haplotypes. HLA testing can exclude diagnosis but has low specificity, providing little information suitable for clinical risk stratification. Using six European CD cohorts, we provide a proof-of-concept that statistical learning approaches which simultaneously model all SNPs can generate robust and highly accurate predictive models based on genome-wide SNP profiles. The high predictive capacity replicated both in cross-validation within each cohort (AUC of 0.87-0.89) and in independent replication across cohorts (AUC of 0.86-0.9), despite differences in ethnicity. The models explained 30-35% of disease variance and up to equation of heritability. The GRS's utility was assessed in different clinically relevant settings. Comparable to HLA typing, the GRS can be used to identify individuals without CD with equation negative predictive value however, unlike HLA typing, patients can also be stratified into categories of higher-risk for CD who would benefit from more invasive and costly definitive testing. The GRS is flexible and its performance can be adapted to the clinical situation by adjusting the threshold cut-off. Despite explaining a minority of disease heritability, our findings indicate a predictive GRS provides clinically relevant information to improve upon current diagnostic pathways for CD, and support further studies evaluating the clinical utility of this approach in CD and other complex diseases.",13,['stat'],10
1304.5008,q-bio,"Zero-lag synchronization between distant cortical areas has been observed in a diversity of experimental data sets and between many different regions of the brain. Several computational mechanisms have been proposed to account for such isochronous synchronization in the presence of long conduction delays: Of these, the phenomenon of ""dynamical relaying"" - a mechanism that relies on a specific network motif - has proven to be the most robust with respect to parameter mismatch and system noise. Surprisingly, despite a contrary belief in the community, the common driving motif is an unreliable means of establishing zero-lag synchrony. Although dynamical relaying has been validated in empirical and computational studies, the deeper dynamical mechanisms and comparison to dynamics on other motifs is lacking. By systematically comparing synchronization on a variety of small motifs, we establish that the presence of a single reciprocally connected pair - a ""resonance pair"" - plays a crucial role in disambiguating those motifs that foster zero-lag synchrony in the presence of conduction delays (such as dynamical relaying) from those that do not (such as the common driving triad). Remarkably, minor structural changes to the common driving motif that incorporate a reciprocal pair recover robust zero-lag synchrony. The findings are observed in computational models of spiking neurons, populations of spiking neurons and neural mass models, and arise whether the oscillatory systems are periodic, chaotic, noise-free or driven by stochastic inputs. The influence of the resonance pair is also robust to parameter mismatch and asymmetrical time delays amongst the elements of the motif. We call this manner of facilitating zero-lag synchrony resonance-induced synchronization, outline the conditions for its occurrence, and propose that it may be a general mechanism to promote zero-lag synchrony in the brain.",13,"['cond-mat', 'nlin', 'physics']",10

Based on two different, bioinformatics-related applications we illustrate how the proposed method can be efficiently used to identify clusters with proven real-life relevance.",13,[],10
1310.8634,q-bio,"Speciation is driven by many different factors. Among those are trade-offs between different ways an organism utilizes resources, and these trade-offs can constrain the manner in which selection can optimize traits. Limited migration among allopatric populations and species interactions can also drive speciation, but here we ask if trade-offs alone are sufficient to drive speciation in the absence of other factors. We present a model to study the effects of trade-offs on specialization and adaptive radiation in asexual organisms based solely on competition for limiting resources, where trade-offs are stronger the greater an organism's ability to utilize resources. In this model resources are perfectly substitutable, and fitness is derived from the consumption of these resources. The model contains no spatial parameters, and is therefore strictly sympatric. We quantify the degree of specialization by the number of ecotypes formed and the niche breadth of the population, and observe that these are sensitive to resource influx and trade-offs. Resource influx has a strong effect on the degree of specialization, with a clear transition between minimal diversification at high influx and multiple species evolving at low resource influx. At low resource influx the degree of specialization further depends on the strength of the trade-offs, with more ecotypes evolving the stronger trade-offs are. The specialized organisms persist through negative frequency-dependent selection. In addition, by analyzing one of the evolutionary radiations in greater detail we demonstrate that a single mutation alone is not enough to establish a new ecotype, even though phylogenetic reconstruction identifies that mutation as the branching point. Instead, it takes a series of additional mutations to ensure the stable coexistence of the new ecotype in the background of the existing ones, reminiscent of a recent observa",13,[],10
1309.2686,q-bio,"During migration, amoeboid cells perform a cycle of quasi-periodic repetitive events (motility cycle). the cell length and the strain energy exchanged with the substrate oscillate in time with an average frequency, f, on top of which are imposed smaller random fluctuations. the fact that a considerable portion of the changes in cell shape are due to periodic repetitive events enables the use of conditional statistics methods to analyze the network of biochemical processes involved in cell motility. taking advan- tage of this cyclic nature, we apply Principal Component analysis (PCa) and phase- average statistics to analyze the dominant modes of shape change and their association to the activity and localization of molecular motors.

1310.7682,q-bio,"We outline the rationale and preliminary results of using the state context property (SCOP) formalism, originally developed as a generalization of quantum mechanics, to describe the contextual manner in which concepts are evoked, used and combined to generate meaning. The quantum formalism was developed to cope with problems arising in the description of (i) the measurement process, and (ii) the generation of new states with new properties when particles become entangled. Similar problems arising with concepts motivated the formal treatment introduced here. Concepts are viewed not as fixed representations, but entities existing in states of potentiality that require interaction with a context-a stimulus or another concept-to 'collapse' to an instantiated form (e.g. exemplar, prototype, or other possibly imaginary instance). The stimulus situation plays the role of the measurement in physics, acting as context that induces a change of the cognitive state from superposition state to collapsed state. The collapsed state is more likely to consist of a conjunction of concepts for associative than analytic thought because more stimulus or concept properties take part in the collapse. We provide two contextual measures of conceptual distance-one using collapse probabilities and the other weighted properties-and show how they can be applied to conjunctions using the pet fish problem.",13,"['cs', 'quant-ph']",10
1307.0869,q-bio,"With the astonishing rate that the genomic and metagenomic sequence data sets are accumulating, there are many reasons to constrain the data analyses. One approach to such constrained analyses is to focus on select subsets of gene families that are particularly well suited for the tasks at hand. Such gene families have generally been referred to as marker genes. We are particularly interested in identifying and using such marker genes for phylogenetic and phylogeny-driven ecological studies of microbes and their communities. We therefore refer to these as PhyEco (for phylogenetic and phylogenetic ecology) markers. The dual use of these PhyEco markers means that we needed to develop and apply a set of somewhat novel criteria for identification of the best candidates for such markers. The criteria we focused on included universality across the taxa of interest, ability to be used to produce robust phylogenetic trees that reflect as much as possible the evolution of the species from which the genes come, and low variation in copy number across taxa. We describe here an automated protocol for identifying potential PhyEco markers from a set of complete genome sequences. The protocol combines rapid searching, clustering and phylogenetic tree building algorithms to generate protein families that meet the criteria listed above. We report here the identification of PhyEco markers for different taxonomic levels including 40 for all bacteria and archaea, 114 for all bacteria, and much more for some of the individual phyla of bacteria. This new list of PhyEco markers should allow much more detailed automated phylogenetic and phylogenetic ecology analyses of these groups than possible previously.",13,[],10

Recently, other cues have been shown to guide cells in vitro, including stiffness/adhesion gradients or micro-patterned adhesive motifs. However, the cellular mechanism leading to these biased migrations remains unknown, and, often, even the direction of motion is unpredictable. In this study, we show the key role of fluctuating protrusions on ratchet-like structures in driving NIH3T3 cell migration. We identified the concept of efficient protrusion and an associated direction index. Our analysis of the protrusion statistics facilitated the quantitative prediction of cell trajectories in all investigated conditions. We varied the external cues by changing the adhesive patterns. We also modified the internal cues using drug treatments, which modified the protrusion activity. Stochasticity affects the short- and long-term steps. We developed a theoretical model showing that an asymmetry in the protrusion fluctuations is sufficient for predicting all measures associated with the long-term motion, which can be described as a biased persistent random walk.",13,[],10

We calculate exactly the steady state frequency in a nonrecombining population when population size is infinite and for a neutral finite population, and obtain bounds on the fraction of deleterious mutations. We also find that for small and very large populations, the number of deleterious mutations depends weakly on recombination, but for moderately large populations, recombination alleviates the effect of deleterious mutations. An analytical argument shows that recombination decreases disadvantageous mutations appreciably when beneficial mutations are rare as is the case in adapting microbial populations, whereas it has a moderate effect on codon bias where the mutation rates between the preferred and unpreferred codons are comparable.",13,['cond-mat'],10

To take full advantage of the new generation of microelectrodes with hundreds or even thousands of electrode contacts, an accurate quantitative link between what is measured and the underlying neural circuit activity is needed. Here we address the question of how the observed frequency dependence of recorded local field potentials (LFPs) should be interpreted. By use of a well-established biophysical modeling scheme, combined with detailed reconstructed neuronal morphologies, we find that correlations in the synaptic inputs onto a population of pyramidal cells may significantly boost the low-frequency components of the generated LFP. We further find that these low-frequency components may be less `local' than the high-frequency LFP components in the sense that (1) the size of signal-generation region of the LFP recorded at an electrode is larger and (2) that the LFP generated by a synaptically activated population spreads further outside the population edge due to volume conduction.",13,[],10
1308.4433,q-bio,"Computational methods are needed to differentiate the small fraction of missense mutations that contribute to disease by disrupting protein function from neutral variants. We describe several complementary methods using large-scale homology modeling of human protein complexes to detect non-neutral mutations. Importantly, unlike sequence conservation-based methods, this structure-based approach provides experimentally testable biochemical mechanisms for mutations in disease. Specifically, we infer metal ion, small molecule, protein-protein, and nucleic acid binding sites by homology and find that disease-associated missense mutations are more prevalent in each class of binding site than are neutral mutations. Importantly, our approach identifies considerably more binding sites than those annotated in the RefSeq database. Furthermore, an analysis of metal ion and protein-protein binding sites predicted by machine learning shows a similar preponderance of disease-associated mutations in these sites. We also derive a statistical score for predicting how mutations affect metal ion binding and find many dbSNP mutations that likely disrupt ion binding but were not previously considered deleterious. We also cluster mutations in the protein structure to discover putative functional regions. Finally, we develop a machine learning predictor for detecting disease-associated missense mutations and show that it outperforms two other prediction methods on an independent test set.",13,[],10
1303.5111,q-bio,"Several studies have shown that bursting neurons can encode information in the number of spikes per burst: As the stimulus varies, so does the length of individual bursts. The represented stimuli, however, vary substantially among different sensory modalities and different neurons. The goal of this paper is to determine which kind of stimulus features can be encoded in burst length, and how those features depend on the mathematical properties of the underlying dynamical system. We show that the initiation and termination of each burst is triggered by specific stimulus features whose temporal characteristsics are determined by the types of bifurcations that initiate and terminate firing in each burst. As only a few bifurcations are possible, only a restricted number of encoded features exists. Here we focus specifically on describing parabolic, square-wave and elliptic bursters. We find that parabolic bursters, whose firing is initiated and terminated by saddle-node bifurcations, behave as prototypical integrators: Firing is triggered by depolarizing stimuli, and lasts for as long as excitation is prolonged. Elliptic bursters, contrastingly, constitute prototypical resonators, since both the initiating and terminating bifurcations possess well-defined oscillation time scales. Firing is therefore triggered by stimulus stretches of matching frequency and terminated by a phase-inversion in the oscillation. The behavior of square-wave bursters is somewhat intermediate, since they are triggered by a fold bifurcation of cycles of well-defined frequency but are terminated by a homoclinic bifurcation lacking an oscillating time scale. These correspondences show that stimulus selectivity is determined by the type of bifurcations. We also demonstrate that additional biological properties that do not modify the bifurcation structure play a minor role in stimulus encoding.",13,[],10

1301.4298,q-bio,"In the course of animal development, the shape of tissue emerges in part from mechanical and biochemical interactions between cells. Measuring stress in tissue is essential for studying morphogenesis and its physical constraints. Experimental measurements of stress reported thus far have been invasive, indirect, or local. One theoretical approach is force inference from cell shapes and connectivity, which is non-invasive, can provide a space-time map of stress and relies on prefactors. Here, to validate force- inference methods, we performed a comparative study of them. Three force-inference methods, which differ in their approach of treating indefiniteness in an inverse problem between cell shapes and forces, were tested by using two artificial and two experimental data sets. Our results using different datasets consistently indicate that our Bayesian force inference, by which cell-junction tensions and cell pressures are simultaneously estimated, performs best in terms of accuracy and robustness.

1307.1736,q-bio,"Interactions among multiple infectious agents are increasingly recognized as a fundamental issue in the understanding of key questions in public health, regarding pathogen emergence, maintenance, and evolution. The full description of host-multipathogen systems is however challenged by the multiplicity of factors affecting the interaction dynamics and the resulting competition that may occur at different scales, from the within-host scale to the spatial structure and mobility of the host population. Here we study the dynamics of two competing pathogens in a structured host population and assess the impact of the mobility pattern of hosts on the pathogen competition. We model the spatial structure of the host population in terms of a metapopulation network and focus on two strains imported locally in the system and having the same transmission potential but different infectious periods. We find different scenarios leading to competitive success of either one of the strain or to the codominance of both strains in the system. The dominance of the strain characterized by the shorter or longer infectious period depends exclusively on the structure of the population and on the the mobility of hosts across patches. The proposed modeling framework allows the integration of other relevant epidemiological, environmental and demographic factors opening the path to further mathematical and computational studies of the dynamics of multipathogen systems.",13,['physics'],10

This paper introduces a new, cognitively inspired framework for chronicling material cultural history, building on Lipo's (2005) network-based computational approach.

1307.7785,q-bio,"Synfire chains are thought to underlie precisely-timed sequences of spikes observed in various brain regions and across species. How they are formed is not understood. Here we analyze self-organization of synfire chains through the spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) of the synapses, axon remodeling, and potentiation decay of synaptic weights in networks of neurons driven by noisy external inputs and subject to dominant feedback inhibition. Potentiation decay is the gradual, activity-independent reduction of synaptic weights over time. We show that potentiation decay enables a dynamic and statistically stable network connectivity when neurons spike spontaneously. Periodic stimulation of a subset of neurons leads to formation of synfire chains through a random recruitment process, which terminates when the chain connects to itself and forms a loop. We demonstrate that chain length distributions depend on the potentiation decay. Fast potentiation decay leads to long chains with wide distributions, while slow potentiation decay leads to short chains with narrow distributions. We suggest that the potentiation decay, which corresponds to the decay of early long-term potentiation of synapses (E-LTP), is an important synaptic plasticity rule in regulating formation of neural circuity through STDP.",13,[],10

1308.2134,q-bio,"Background: Recent assays for individual-specific genome-wide DNA methylation profiles have enabled epigenome-wide association studies to identify specific CpG sites associated with a phenotype. Computational prediction of CpG site-specific methylation levels is important, but current approaches tackle average methylation within a genomic locus and are often limited to specific genomic regions. Results: We characterize genome-wide DNA methylation patterns, and show that correlation among CpG sites decays rapidly, making predictions solely based on neighboring sites challenging. We built a random forest classifier to predict CpG site methylation levels using as features neighboring CpG site methylation levels and genomic distance, and co-localization with coding regions, CGIs, and regulatory elements from the ENCODE project, among others. Our approach achieves 91% -- 94% prediction accuracy of genome-wide methylation levels at single CpG site precision. The accuracy increases to 98% when restricted to CpG sites within CGIs. Our classifier outperforms state-of-the-art methylation classifiers and identifies features that contribute to prediction accuracy: neighboring CpG site methylation status, CpG island status, co-localized DNase I hypersensitive sites, and specific transcription factor binding sites were found to be most predictive of methylation levels. Conclusions: Our observations of DNA methylation patterns led us to develop a classifier to predict site-specific methylation levels that achieves the best DNA methylation predictive accuracy to date. Furthermore, our method identified genomic features that interact with DNA methylation, elucidating mechanisms involved in DNA methylation modification and regulation, and linking different epigenetic processes.",13,[],10

Here we study how evolution of gene regulation in a single-cell eukaryote S. cerevisiae is affected by the interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their cognate genomic sites. Our study is informed by high-throughput in vitro measurements of TF-DNA binding interactions and by a comprehensive collection of genomic binding sites. Using an evolutionary model for monomorphic populations evolving on a fitness landscape, we infer fitness as a function of TF-DNA binding energy for a collection of 12 yeast TFs, and show that the shape of the predicted fitness functions is in broad agreement with a simple thermodynamic model of two-state TF-DNA binding. However, the effective temperature of the model is not always equal to the physical temperature, indicating selection pressures in addition to biophysical constraints caused by TF-DNA interactions. We find little statistical support for the fitness landscape in which each position in the binding site evolves independently, showing that epistasis is common in evolution of gene regulation. Finally, by correlating TF-DNA binding energies with biological properties of the sites or the genes they regulate, we are able to rule out several scenarios of site-specific selection, under which binding sites of the same TF would experience a spectrum of selection pressures depending on their position in the genome. These findings argue for the existence of universal fitness landscapes which shape evolution of all sites for a given TF, and whose properties are determined in part by the physics of protein-DNA interactions.",13,[],10

In this article we present a theoretical investigation of efficiency of a kinetic proofreading mechanism that employs hydrolysis of the wrong substrate as the discriminatory step in enzyme catalytic reactions. We consider aminoacylation of tRNAIle which is a crucial step in protein synthesis and for which experimental results are now available. We present an augmented kinetic scheme and then employ methods of stochastic simulation algorithm to obtain time dependent concentrations of different substances involved in the reaction and their rates of formation. We obtain the rates of product formation and ATP hydrolysis for both correct and wrong substrates (isoleucine and valine in our case), in single molecular enzyme as well as ensemble enzyme kinetics. The present theoretical scheme correctly reproduces (i) the amplitude of the discrimination factor in the overall rates between isoleucine and valine which is obtained as (1.8 \times 102).(4.33 \times 102) = 7.8 \times 104, (ii) the rates of ATP hydrolysis for both Ile and Val at different substrate concentrations in the aminoacylation of tRNAIle. The present study shows a non-michaelis type dependence of rate of reaction on tRNAIle concentration in case of valine.

1312.6321,q-bio,"Virophages are viruses that rely on the replication machinery of other viruses to reproduce within eukaryotic hosts. Two different modes of coinfection have been posited based on experimental observation. In one mode, the virophage and virus enter the host independently. In the other mode, the virophage adheres to the virus so both virophage and virus enter the host together. Here we ask: what are the ecological effects of these different modes of coinfection? In particular, what ecological effects are common to both infection modes, and what are the differences particular to each mode? We develop a pair of biophysically motivated ODE models of viral-host population dynamics, corresponding to dynamics arising from each mode of infection. We find both modes of coinfection allow for the coexistence of the virophage, virus, and host either at a stable fixed point or through cyclical dynamics. In both models, virophage tend to be the most abundant population and their presence always reduces the viral abundance and increases the host abundance. However, we do find qualitative differences between models. For example, via extensive sampling of biologically relevant parameter space, we only observe bistability when the virophage and virus enter the host together. We discuss how such differences may be leveraged to help identify modes of infection in natural environments from population level data.",13,[],10

""Well-temperate"" phage from our title is characterized by the best long-term population growth rate. We show that it is realized when the lysogenization frequency is approximately equal to the probability of lytic population collapse.

For a given density matrix and any general SIC-POVM, the so-called index of coincidence of generated probability distribution is exactly calculated. Using this result, we obtain state-dependent entropic bounds for a single general SIC-POVM. Lower entropic bounds are derived in terms of the R\'enyi equation-entropies for equation and the Tsallis equation-entropies for equation. A lower bound on the min-entropy of a SIC-POVM is separately examined. For a pair of general SIC-POVMs, entropic uncertainty relations of the Maassen-Uffink type are considered.",13,"['math-ph', 'math']",6
1307.4407,quant-ph,"Quantum transport and other phenomena are typically modeled by coupling the system of interest to an environment, or bath, held at thermal equilibrium. Realistic bath models are at least as challenging to construct as models for the quantum systems themselves, since they must incorporate many degrees of freedom that interact with the system on a wide range of timescales. Owing to computational limitations, the environment is often modeled with simple functional forms, with a few parameters fit to experiment to yield semi-quantitative results. Growing computational resources have enabled the construction of more realistic bath models from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In this paper, we develop a numerical technique to construct these atomistic bath models with better accuracy and decreased cost. We apply a novel signal processing technique, known as super-resolution, combined with a dictionary of physically-motivated bath modes to derive spectral densities from MD simulations. Our approach reduces the required simulation time and provides a more accurate spectral density than can be obtained via standard Fourier transform methods. Moreover, the spectral density is provided as a convenient closed-form expression which yields an analytic time-dependent bath kernel. Exciton dynamics of the Fenna-Matthews-Olsen light-harvesting complex are simulated with a second order time-convolutionless master equation, and spectral densities constructed via super-resolution are shown to reproduce the dynamics using only a quarter of the amount of MD data.",13,['physics'],6

1311.6321,quant-ph,"Circuit cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) is proving to be a powerful platform to implement quantum feedback control schemes due to the ability to control superconducting qubits and microwaves in a circuit. Here, we present a simple and promising quantum feedback control scheme for deterministic generation and stabilization of a three-qubit equation state in the superconducting circuit QED system. The control scheme is based on continuous joint Zeno measurements of multiple qubits in a dispersive regime, which enables us not only to infer the state of the qubits for further information processing but also to create and stabilize the target equation state through adaptive quantum feedback control. We simulate the dynamics of the proposed quantum feedback control scheme using the quantum trajectory approach with an effective stochastic maser equation obtained by a polaron-type transformation method and demonstrate that in the presence of moderate environmental decoherence, the average state fidelity higher than equation can be achieved and maintained for a considerable long time (much longer than the single-qubit decoherence time). This control scheme is also shown to be robust against measurement inefficiency and individual qubit decay rate differences. Finally, the comparison of the polaron-type transformation method to the commonly used adiabatic elimination method to eliminate the cavity mode is presented.",13,['cond-mat'],6

Gaining information about the momentum distribution by means of the particular experimental setup is thus possible with negligible impact on the position distribution. Furthermore, we construct explicitly a class of states simultaneously localised on periodic sets in position and momentum space, which are therefore eigenstates of the observables being measured jointly (to a good approximation) in multi-slit interferometry.

We model the process using coupled-mode equations appropriate for wave mixing in a uniform second- order nonlinear optical medium pumped by a strong laser pulse. We find Green functions describing the process, and employ Schmidt (singular- value) decompositions thereof to quantify its viability in functioning as a coherent waveform discriminator. We define a selectivity figure of merit in terms of the Schmidt coefficients, and use it to compare and contrast various parameter regimes via extensive numerical computations. We identify the most favorable regime (at least in the case of no pump chirp) and derive the complete analytical solution for the same. We bound the maximum achievable selectivity in this parameter space. We show that including a frequency chirp in the pump does not improve selectivity in this optimal regime. We also find an operating regime in which high-efficiency frequency conversion without temporal-shape selectivity can be achieved while preserving the shapes of a wide class of input pulses.

Here, we quantify this by the reduction in any one of the family of R\'enyi entropies equation, with equation, at some terminal time, revealing the rich structure of stochastic quantum control even for this simple problem. We generalize Jacobs' original argument, which was for (the unique) impurity measure with a linear evolution map under his protocol, by replacing linearity with convexity, thereby making it applicable to R\'enyi entropies equation for equation in a finite interval about equation. Even with this generalization, Jacobs' argument fails to identify the surprising fact, which we prove by Bellman's principle of dynamic programming, that his protocol is globally optimal for all R\'enyi entropies whose decrease is locally maximized by that protocol. Also surprisingly, even though there is a range of R\'enyi entropies whose decrease is always locally maximized by the null-control protocol, that null-control protocol cannot be shown to be globally optimal in any instance.

1303.0808,quant-ph,"Since a quantum measurement generally disturbs the state of a quantum system, one might think that it should not be possible for a sender and receiver to communicate reliably when the receiver performs a large number of sequential measurements to determine the message of the sender. We show here that this intuition is not true, by demonstrating that a sequential decoding strategy works well even in the most general ""one-shot"" regime, where we are given a single instance of a channel and wish to determine the maximal number of bits that can be communicated up to a small failure probability. This result follows by generalizing a non-commutative union bound to apply for a sequence of general measurements. We also demonstrate two ways in which a receiver can recover a state close to the original state after it has been decoded by a sequence of measurements that each succeed with high probability.

This sum decreases as equation as long as equation. This scaling prediction is tested by performing large-scale simulations which solve the time-dependent Schrodinger equation for a ring of spin-1/2 particles, four of them belonging to equation and the others to equation. Provided that the time evolution drives the whole system from the initial state toward a state which has similar properties as states belonging to the class of quantum states for which we derived the scaling relationship, the scaling prediction holds.

1302.6389,quant-ph,An ideal source of entangled photon pairs combines the perfect symmetry of an atom with the convenient electrical trigger of light sources based on semiconductor quantum dots. We create a naturally symmetric quantum dot cascade that emits highly entangled photon pairs on demand. Our source consists of strain-free GaAs dots self-assembled on a triangular symmetric (111)A surface. The emitted photons strongly violate Bell's inequality and reveal a fidelity to the Bell state as high as 86 (-2) % without postselection. This result is an important step towards scalable quantum-communication applications with efficient sources.,13,['cond-mat'],6
1305.4904,quant-ph,"A pair of recent articles concluded that the D-Wave One machine actually operates in the quantum regime, rather than performing some classical evolution.

1302.2477,quant-ph,"A complete suppression of the exponential decay in a qubit (interacting with a squeezed vacuum reservoir) can be achieved by frequent measurements of adequately chosen observables. The observables and initial states (Zeno subspace) for which the effect occurs depend on the squeezing parameters of the bath. We show thesequantum Zeno dynamics to be substantially different for selective and non-selective measurements. In either case, the approach to the Zeno limit for a finite number of measurements is also studied numerically. The calculation is extended from one to two qubits, where we see both Zeno and anti-Zeno effects depending on the initial state. The reason for the striking differences with the situation in closed systems is discussed.",13,['cond-mat'],6
1302.4709,quant-ph,"We consider a real massless scalar field in 31 dimensions satisfying a Robin boundary condition at a nonrelativistic moving mirror. Considering vacuum as the initial field state, we compute explicitly the number of particles created per unit frequency and per unit solid angle, exhibiting in this way the angular dependence of the spectral distribution. The well known cases of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions may be reobtained as particular cases from our results. We show that the particle creation rate can be considerably reduced (with respect to the Dirichlet and Neumann cases) for particular values of the Robin parameter. Our results extend for 31 dimensions previous results found in the literature for 11 dimensions. Further, we also show that this inhibition of the dynamical Casimir effect occurs for different angles of particle emission.",13,['hep-th'],6
1312.2012,quant-ph,"N00N states -- maximally path-entangled states of N photons -- exhibit spatial interference patterns sharper than any classical interference pattern. This is known as super-resolution. However, even with perfectly efficient number-resolving detectors, the detection efficiency of all previously demonstrated methods to measure such interference decreases exponentially with the number of photons in the N00N state, often leading to the conclusion that N00N states are unsuitable for spatial measurements. Here, we create spatial super-resolution fringes with two-, three-, and four-photon N00N states, and demonstrate a scalable implementation of the so-called 'optical centroid measurement' which provides an in-principle perfect detection efficiency. Moreover, we compare the N00N-state interference to the corresponding classical super-resolution interference. Although both provide the same increase in spatial frequency, the visibility of the classical fringes decreases exponentially with the number of detected photons, while the visibility of our experimentally measured N00N-state super-resolution fringes remains approximately constant with N. Our implementation of the optical centroid measurement is a scalable method to measure high photon-number quantum interference, an essential step forward for quantum-enhanced measurements, overcoming what was believed to be a fundamental challenge to quantum metrology.",13,[],6
1311.6696,quant-ph,"The approximate contraction of a Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) tensor network is a fundamental ingredient of any PEPS algorithm, required for the optimization of the tensors in ground state search or time evolution, as well as for the evaluation of expectation values. An exact contraction is in general impossible, and the choice of the approximating procedure determines the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm. We analyze different previous proposals for this approximation, and show that they can be understood via the form of their environment, i.e. the operator that results from contracting part of the network. This provides physical insight into the limitation of various approaches, and allows us to introduce a new strategy, based on the idea of clusters, that unifies previous methods. The resulting contraction algorithm interpolates naturally between the cheapest and most imprecise and the most costly and most precise method. We benchmark the different algorithms with finite PEPS, and show how the cluster strategy can be used for both the tensor optimization and the calculation of expectation values. Additionally, we discuss its applicability to the parallelization of PEPS and to infinite systems (iPEPS).",13,['cond-mat'],6

Moreover, they are closely related to various energetic density-functionals of quantum systems. Here we find sharp upper bounds to these quantities in terms of the second order moment equation for general spherically symmetric potentials, which substantially improve previous results of this type, by means of the R\'enyi maximization procedure with a covariance constraint due to Costa, Hero and Vignat \citeCosHer03. The contributions to these bounds coming from the radial and angular parts of the physical wavefunctions are explicitly given.",13,[],6
1309.3924,quant-ph,"We determine how a system composed of two nonidentical two-level atoms with different resonance frequencies and different damping rates could work as a nano-antenna for controlled mode switching and light routing. We calculate the angular distribution of the emitted field detected in a far-field zone of the system including the direct interatomic interactions and arbitrary linear dimensions of the system. The calculation is carried out in terms of the symmetric and antisymmetric modes of the two atom system. We find that as long as the atoms are identical, the emission cannot be switched between the symmetric and antisymmetric modes. The switching may occur when the atoms are non-identical and the emission can then be routed to different modes by changing the relative ratio of the atomic frequencies, or damping rates or by a proper tuning of the laser frequency to the atomic resonance frequencies. It is shown that in the case of atoms of different resonance frequencies but equal damping rates, the light routing is independent of the frequency of the driving laser field. It depends only on the sign of the detuning between the atomic resonance frequencies. In the case of atoms of different damping rates, the emission can be switched between different modes by changing the laser frequency from the blue to red detuned from the atomic resonance. The effect of the interatomic interactions is also considered and it is found that in the case of unequal resonance frequencies of the atoms, the interactions slightly modify the visibility of the intensity pattern. The case of unequal damping rates of the atoms is affected rather more drastically, the light routing becoming asymmetric under the dipole-dipole interaction with the enhanced intensities of the modes turned towards the atom of smaller damping rate.",13,[],6
1309.0613,quant-ph,"Photon-echo based quantum memories use inhomogeneously broadened, optically thick ensembles of absorbers to store a weak optical signal and employ various protocols to rephase the atomic coherences for information retrieval. We study the application of two consecutive, frequency-chirped control pulses for coherence rephasing in an ensemble with a 'natural' inhomogeneous broadening. Although propagation effects distort the two control pulses differently, chirped pulses that drive adiabatic passage can rephase atomic coherences in an optically thick storage medium. Combined with spatial phase mismatching techniques to prevent primary echo emission, coherences can be rephased around the ground state to achieve secondary echo emission with close to unit efficiency. Potential advantages over similar schemes working with equation-pulses include greater potential signal fidelity, reduced noise due to spontaneous emission and better capability for the storage of multiple memory channels.",13,[],6
1311.1982,quant-ph,"We report on the demonstration of a light-matter interface coupling light to a single equation ion in free space. The interface is realized through a parabolic mirror partially surrounding the ion. It transforms a Laguerre-Gaussian beam into a linear dipole wave converging at the mirror's focus. By measuring the non-linear response of the atomic transition we deduce the power required for reaching an upper-level population of equation to be equation at half linewidth detuning from the atomic resonance. Performing this measurement while scanning the ion through the focus provides a map of the focal intensity distribution. From the measured power we infer a coupling efficiency of equation on the linear dipole transition when illuminating from half solid angle, being among the best coupling efficiencies reported for a single atom in free space.",13,['physics'],6
1305.6405,quant-ph,Spontaneous emission from crystal centers is influenced by both the photonic local density of states and non-radiative processes. Here we monitor the spontaneous emission of single nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers as their host diamond is reduced in size from a large monolithic crystal to a nanocrystal by successive cycles of oxidation. The size reduction induces a quenching of the NV radiative emission. New non-radiative channels lead to a decrease of the fluorescence intensity and the excited state lifetime. In one case we observe the onset of blinking which may provide a route to understand these additional non-radiative decay channels.,13,['cond-mat'],6

We prove that the existence of a strongly positive joint quantum measure -- the quantum analogue of a joint probability measure -- on a set of experimental probabilities implies the Navascues-Pironio-Acin (NPA) condition equation and is implied by the stronger NPA condition equation. A related condition is shown to be equivalent to equation.,13,['gr-qc'],6
1307.1541,quant-ph,"We study the ground state of two-component bosonic atoms in a one-dimensional optical lattice. By applying an external field to the atoms at one end of lattice, the atoms are transported and becomes localized at that site. The holes are then created in the remaining sites. The particle-hole superpositions are produced in this process. We investigate the entanglement entropy between the atoms in the two different parts of a lattice. A large degree of particle-hole entanglement is generated in the ground state. The particle-hole quantum correlations can be probed by the two-site parity correlation functions.

1310.2927,quant-ph,"Modern programming relies on our ability to treat preprogrammed functions as black boxes - we can invoke them as subroutines without knowing their physical implementation. Here we show it is generally impossible to execute an unknown quantum subroutine. This, as a special case, forbids applying black-box subroutines conditioned on an ancillary qubit. We explore how this limits many quantum algorithms - forcing their circuit implementation to be individually tailored to specific inputs and inducing failure if these inputs are not known in advance. We present a method to avoid this situation for certain computational problems. We apply this method to enhance existing quantum factoring algorithms; reducing their complexity, and the extent to which they need to be tailored to factor specific numbers. Thus, we highlight a natural property of classical information that fails in the advent of quantum logic; and simultaneously demonstrate how to mitigate its effects in practical situations.",13,[],6
1301.7351,quant-ph,"Despite high hopes for quantum computation in the 1990s, progress in the past decade has been slow; we still cannot perform computation with more than about three qubits and are no closer to solving problems of real interest than a decade ago. Separately, recent experiments in fluid mechanics have demonstrated the emergence of a full range of quantum phenomena from completely classical motion. We present two specific hypotheses. First, Kuramoto theory may give a basis for geometrical thinking about entanglement. Second, we consider a recent soliton model of the electron, in which the quantum-mechanical wave function is a phase modulation of a carrier wave. Both models are consistent with one another and with observation. Both models suggest how entanglement and decoherence may be related to device geometry. Both models predict that it will be difficult to maintain phase coherence of more than three qubits in the plane, or four qubits in a three-dimensional structure. The soliton model also shows that the experimental work which appeared to demonstrate a violation of Bell's inequalities might not actually do so; regardless of whether it is a correct description of the world, it exposes a flaw in the logic of the Bell tests. Thus the case for the security of EPR-based quantum cryptography has just not been made. We propose experiments in quantum computation to test this. Finally, we examine two possible interpretations of such soliton models: one is consistent with the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics, while the other is an entirely classical model in which we do not have to abandon the idea of a single world where action is local and causal.",13,"['cs', 'math-ph', 'math']",6
1312.4311,quant-ph,"Identical particles and entanglement are both fundamental components of quantum mechanics. However, when identical particles are condensed in a single spatial mode, the standard notions of entanglement, based on clearly identifiable subsystems, break down. This has led many to conclude that such systems have limited value for quantum information tasks, compared to distinguishable particle systems. To the contrary, we show that any entanglement formally appearing amongst the identical particles, including entanglement due purely to symmetrization, can be extracted into an entangled state of independent modes, which can then be applied to any task. In fact, the entanglement of the mode system is in one-to-one correspondence with the entanglement between the inaccessible identical particles. This settles the long-standing debate about the resource capabilities of such states, in particular spin-squeezed states of Bose-Einstein condensates, while also revealing a new perspective on how and when entanglement is generated in passive optical networks. Our results thus reveal new fundamental connections between entanglement, squeezing, and indistinguishability.",13,[],6

A critical energy separates two different phases, one in which the symmetry is broken. This critical behavior is ruled out as soon as the system is put in contact with a thermal bath. The critical point is crossed when a sufficent amount of work is performed on the system, keeping it isolated from the environment. Different phases are identified by means of an order parameter, which is only different from zero in the symmetry-breaking phase.
