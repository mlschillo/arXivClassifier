1603.05661,astro-ph,"With current space-based missions it is now possible to obtain age-sensitive asteroseismic information for tens of thousands of red giants. This provides a promising opportunity to study the Galactic structure and evolution. We use asteroseismic data of red giants, observed by Kepler, to test the current theoretical framework of modelling the Galaxy based on population synthesis modeling and the use of asteroseismic scaling relations for giants. We use the open source code Galaxia to model the Milky Way and find the distribution of the masses predicted by Galaxia to be systematically offset with respect to the seismically-inferred observed masses. The Galactic model overestimates the number of low mass stars, and these stars are predominantly old and of low metallicity. Using corrections to the equation scaling relation suggested by stellar models (available for download) significantly reduces the disagreement between predicted and observed masses. For a few cases where non-seismic mass estimates are available, the corrections to equation also improve the agreement between seismic and non-seismic mass estimates. The disagreement between predictions of the Galactic model and the observations is most pronounced for stars with equation and equation or for equation K. Altering the star formation rate in order to suppress stars older than 10 Gyr improves the agreement for mass but leads to inconsistent color distributions. We also tested the predictions of the TRILEGAL Galactic model. However, unlike \sl Galaxia, it had difficulties in reproducing the photometric properties of the Kepler Input Catalog because it overestimates the number of blue stars. We conclude that either the scaling relations and/or the Galactic models need to be revised to reconcile predictions of theory with asteroseismic observations.",16,[],1
1608.06836,astro-ph,"Kepler-20 is a solar-type star (V = 12.5) hosting a compact system of five transiting planets, all packed within the orbital distance of Mercury in our own Solar System. A transition from rocky to gaseous planets with a planetary transition radius of ~1.6 REarth has recently been proposed by several publications in the literature (Rogers 2015;Weiss & Marcy 2014). Kepler-20b (Rp ~ 1.9 REarth) has a size beyond this transition radius, however previous mass measurements were not sufficiently precise to allow definite conclusions to be drawn regarding its composition. We present new mass measurements of three of the planets in the Kepler-20 system facilitated by 104 radial velocity measurements from the HARPS-N spectrograph and 30 archival Keck/HIRES observations, as well as an updated photometric analysis of the Kepler data and an asteroseismic analysis of the host star (MStar = 0.948-0.051 Msun and Rstar = 0.964-0.018 Rsun). Kepler-20b is a 1.8680.066-0.034 REarth planet in a 3.7 day period with a mass of 9.701.41-1.44 MEarth resulting in a mean density of 8.21.5-1.3 g/cc indicating a rocky composition with an iron to silicate ratio consistent with that of the Earth. This makes Kepler-20b the most massive planet with a rocky composition found to date. Furthermore, we report the discovery of an additional non-transiting planet with a minimum mass of 19.963.08-3.61 MEarth and an orbital period of ~34 days in the gap between Kepler-20f (P ~ 11 days) and Kepler-20d (P ~ 78 days).",16,[],1
1604.06795,astro-ph,"We report Shanghai Tian Ma Radio Telescope detections of several long carbon-chain molecules at C and Ku band, including HC3N, HC5N, HC7N, HC9N, C3S, C6H and C8H toward the starless cloud Serpens South 1a. We detected some transitions (HC9N J=13-12 F=12-11 and F=14-13, H13CCCN J=2-1 F=1-0 and F=1-1, HC13CCN J=2-1 F=2-2, F=1-0 and F=1-1, HCC13CN J=2-1 F=1-0 and F=1-1) and resolved some hyperfine components (HC5N J=6-5 F=5-4, H13CCCN J=2-1 F=2-1) for the first time in the interstellar medium. The column densities of these carbon-chain molecules in a range of 1012-1013 cm-2 are comparable to two carbon-chain molecule rich sources, TMC-1 and Lupus-1A. The abundance ratios are 1.00:(1.110.15):(1.470.18) for [H13CCCN]:[HC13CCN]:[HCC13CN]. This result implies that the 13C isotope is also concentrated in the carbon atom adjacent to the nitrogen atom in HC3N in Serpens south 1a, which is similar to TMC-1. The [HC3N]/[H13CCCN] ratio of 789, the [HC3N]/[HC13CCN] ratio of 708, and the [HC3N]/[HCC13CN] ratio of 534 are also comparable to those in TMC-1. In any case, Serpens South 1a proves a testing ground for understanding carbon-chain chemistry.",16,[],1
1605.08968,astro-ph,"Pulsars are rapidly spinning and highly magnetized neutron stars, with highly stable rotational period and gradual spin-down over a long timescale due to the loss of radiation. Glitches refer to the events that suddenly increase the rotational speed of a pulsar. The exact causes of glitches and the resulting processes are not fully understood. It is generally believed that couplings between the normal matter and the superfluid components, and the starquakes, are the common causes of glitches. In this study, one famous glitching pulsar, PSR~J20214026, is investigated. PSR~J20214026 is the first variable gamma-ray pulsar observed by Fermi. From the gamma-ray observations, it is found that the pulsar experienced a significant flux drop, an increase in the spin-down rate, a change in the pulse profile and a shift in the spectral cut-off to a lower energy, simultaneously around 2011 October 16. To explain these effects on the high-energy emissions by the glitch of PSR~J20214026, we hypothesized the glitch to be caused by the rearrangement of the surface magnetic field due to the crustal plate tectonic activities on the pulsar which is triggered by a starquake. In this glitch event, the inclination angle of the magnetic dipole axis is slightly shifted. This proposition is then tested by numerical modeling using a three-dimensional two-layer outer gap model. The simulation results indicate that a modification of the inclination angle can affect the pulse profile and the spectral properties, which can explain the observation changes after the glitch.",16,[],1
1609.02283,astro-ph,"The mean alpha-to-iron abundance ratio ([equation/Fe]) of galaxies is sensitive to the chemical evolution processes at early time, and it is an indicator of star formation timescale (equation). Although the physical reason remains ambiguous, there is a tight relation between [equation/Fe] and stellar velocity dispersion (equation) among massive early-type galaxies (ETGs). However, no work has shown convincing results as to how this relation behaves at low masses. We assemble 15 data sets from the literature and build a large sample that includes 192 nearby low-mass (equation~\kms) ETGs. We find that the [equation/Fe]-equation relation generally holds for low-mass ETGs, except in extreme environments. Specifically, in normal galaxy cluster environments, the [equation/Fe]-equation relation and its intrinsic scatter are, within uncertainties, similar for low-mass and high-mass ETGs. However, in the most massive relaxed galaxy cluster in our sample, the zero point of the relation is higher and the intrinsic scatter is significantly larger. By contrast, in galaxy groups the zero point of the relation offsets in the opposite direction, again with substantial intrinsic scatter. The elevated [equation/Fe] of low-mass ETGs in the densest environments suggests that their star formation was quenched earlier than in high-mass ETGs. For the low-mass ETGs in the lowest density environments, we suggest that their more extended star formation histories suppressed their average [equation/Fe]. The large scatter in [equation/Fe] may reflect stochasticity in the chemical evolution of low-mass galaxies.",16,[],1
1610.05065,astro-ph,"Context. The Annular Groove Phase Mask (AGPM) is one possible implementation of the vector vortex coronagraph, where the helical phase ramp is produced by a concentric subwavelength grating. For several years, we have been manufacturing AGPMs by etching gratings into synthetic diamond substrates using inductively coupled plasma etching. Aims. We aim to design, fabricate, optimize, and evaluate new L-band AGPMs that reach the highest possible coronagraphic performance, for applications in current and forthcoming infrared high-contrast imagers. Methods. Rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) is used for designing the subwavelength grating of the phase mask. Coronagraphic performance evaluation is performed on a dedicated optical test bench. The experimental results of the performance evaluation are then used to accurately determine the actual profile of the fabricated gratings, based on RCWA modeling. Results. The AGPM coronagraphic performance is very sensitive to small errors in etch depth and grating profile. Most of the fabricated components therefore show moderate performance in terms of starlight rejection (a few 100:1 in the best cases). Here we present new processes for re-etching the fabricated components in order to optimize the parameters of the grating and hence significantly increase their coronagraphic performance. Starlight rejection up to 1000:1 is demonstrated in a broadband L filter on the coronagraphic test bench, which corresponds to a raw contrast of about 1e-5 at two resolution elements from the star for a perfect input wave front on a circular, unobstructed aperture. Conclusions. Thanks to their exquisite performance, our latest L-band AGPMs are good candidates for installation in state-of-the-art and future high-contrast thermal infrared imagers, such as METIS for the E-ELT.",16,[],1
1601.01165,astro-ph,"Dedispersion, the removal of deleterious smearing of impulsive signals by the interstellar matter, is one of the most intensive processing steps in any radio survey for pulsars and fast transients. We here present a study of the parallelization of this algorithm on many-core accelerators, including GPUs from AMD and NVIDIA, and the Intel Xeon Phi. We find that dedispersion is inherently memory-bound. Even in a perfect scenario, hardware limitations keep the arithmetic intensity low, thus limiting performance. We next exploit auto-tuning to adapt dedispersion to different accelerators, observations, and even telescopes. We demonstrate that the optimal settings differ between observational setups, and that auto-tuning significantly improves performance. This impacts time-domain surveys from Apertif to SKA.",16,[],1
1608.02980,astro-ph,"Optical spectroscopy study of the recent AG Peg outburst observed during the second half of 2015 is presented. Considerable variations of the intensity and the shape of the spectral features as well as the changes of the hot component parameters, caused by the outburst, are discussed and certain similarities between the outburst of AG Peg and the outburst of a classical symbiotic stars are shown. It seems that after the end of the symbiotic nova phase, AG Peg became a member of the classical symbiotic stars group.",16,[],1
1602.05961,astro-ph,"In recent work we proposed a novel theory of dark matter (DM) superfluidity that matches the successes of the LambdaCDM model on cosmological scales while simultaneously reproducing MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) phenomenology on galactic scales. The agents responsible for mediating the MONDian force law are superfluid phonons that couple to ordinary (baryonic) matter. In this paper we propose an alternative way for the MOND phenomenon to emerge from DM superfluidity. The central idea is to use higher-gradient corrections in the superfluid effective theory. These next-to-leading order terms involve gradients of the gravitational potential, and therefore effectively modify the gravitational force law. In the process we discover a novel mechanism for generating the non-relativistic MOND action, starting from a theory that is fully analytic in all field variables. The idea, inspired by the symmetron mechanism, uses the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry. For large acceleration, the symmetry is unbroken and the action reduces to Einstein gravity. For small acceleration, the symmetry is spontaneously broken and the action reduces to MONDian gravity. Cosmologically, however, the universe is always in the Einstein-gravity, symmetry-restoring phase. The expansion history and linear growth of density perturbations are therefore indistinguishable from LambdaCDM cosmology.",16,"['gr-qc', 'hep-th']",1
1609.01314,astro-ph,"The Qatar-2 transiting exoplanet system was recently observed by the \it Kepler telescope as part of \it K2 Campaign 6. The photometric time series has one-minute time sampling and a precision of about 690~ppm, after filtering out artifacts and spurious trends. We identify dozens of starspot-crossing events, when the planet eclipsed a relatively dark region of the stellar photosphere. The observed patterns in the sequence of these events demonstrate that the planet always transits over the same range of stellar latitudes, and therefore that the stellar obliquity is less than about 10equation. We support this conclusion with two different modeling approaches: one based on explicit identification and timing of the events, and the other based on fitting the light curves with a spotted-star model. We are also able to refine the usual transit parameters and measure the stellar rotation period (equation~days), corresponding to a 'gyrochronological' age of equation Gyr. Coherent flux variations with the same period as the transits are seen throughout the entire light curve. These variations are well modeled as the combined effects of ellipsoidal light variations (equation~ppm) and Doppler boosting (equation~ppm). The magnitudes of these effects are both consistent with a planetary mass of equation, which is in turn consistent with the mass determined by the Doppler technique. No occultations are detected, giving a 2equation upper limit of equation on the planet's visual geometric albedo. The measured transit times are consistent with a constant orbital period. In particular we find no evidence for orbital decay, although we are only able to place a weak lower bound on the relevant tidal quality factor: equation~(95\% confidence).",16,[],1
1611.01121,astro-ph,"The first peak s-process elements Rb, Sr, Y and Zr in the post-AGB star Sakurai's object (V4334 Sagittarii) have been proposed to be the result of i-process nucleosynthesis in a post-AGB very-late thermal pulse event. We estimate the nuclear physics uncertainties in the i-process model predictions to determine whether the remaining discrepancies with observations are significant and point to potential issues with the underlying astrophysical model. We find that the dominant source in the nuclear physics uncertainties are predictions of neutron capture rates on unstable neutron rich nuclei, which can have uncertainties of more than a factor 20 in the band of the i-process. We use a Monte Carlo variation of 52 neutron capture rates and a 1D multi-zone post-processing model for the i-process in Sakurai's object to determine the cumulative effect of these uncertainties on the final elemental abundance predictions. We find that the nuclear physics uncertainties are large and comparable to observational errors. Within these uncertainties the model predictions are consistent with observations. A correlation analysis of the results of our MC simulations reveals that the strongest impact on the predicted abundances of Rb, Sr, Y and Zr is made by the uncertainties in the (n,equation) reaction rates of equationBr, equationBr, equationKr, equationKr, equationKr, equationRb, equationSr, and equationSr. (abridged)",16,[],1
1611.09600,astro-ph,"The effective temperature (Teff) of the radiation field of the ionizing star(s) of a large sample of extragalactic HII regions was estimated using the R= log([OII](3727)/[OIII]5007) index. We used a grid of photoionization models to calibrate the Teff-R relation finding that it has a strong dependence with the ionizing parameter while it shows a weak direct dependence with the metallicity (variations in Z imply variations in U) of both the stellar atmosphere of the ionizing star and the gas phase of the HII region. Since the R index varies slightly with the Teff for values larger than 40 kK, the R index can be used to derive the Teff in 30-40 kK range. A large fraction of the ionization parameter variation is due to differences in the temperature of the ionizing stars and then the use of the (relatively) low Teff dependent S2=[S II](671731)/Ha emission-line ratio to derive the ionization parameter is preferable over others in the literature. We propose linear metallicity dependent relationships between S2 and U. Teff and metallicity estimations for a sample of 865 HII regions, whose emission-line intensities were compiled from the literature, do not show any Teff-Z correlation. On the other hand it seems to be hints of the presence of an anti-correlation between Teff-U. We found that the majority of the studied HII regions (87%) present Teff values in the range between 37 and 40 kK, with an average value of 38.5 kK. We also studied the variation of Teff as a function of the galactocentric distance for 14 spiral galaxies. Our results are in agreement with the idea of the existence of positive Teff gradients along the disk of spiral galaxies.",16,[],1
1601.04941,astro-ph,"We modify Einstein General Relativity by adding non-dynamical scalar fields to account simultaneously for both dark matter and dark energy. The dark energy in this case can be distributed in-homogeneously even within horizon scales. Its inhomogeneities can contribute to the late time integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, possibly removing some of the low multipole anomalies in the temperature fluctuations of the CMB spectrum.

1608.01780,astro-ph,"We find a new substellar companion to the Pleiades member star, Pleiades HII 3441, using the Subaru telescope with adaptive optics. The discovery is made as part of the high-contrast imaging survey to search for planetary-mass and substellar companions in the Pleiades and young moving groups. The companion has a projected separation of 0"".49 /- 0"".02 (66 /- 2 AU) and a mass of 68 /- 5 MJ based on three observations in the J-, H-, and KS-band. The spectral type is estimated to be M7 (~2700 K), and thus no methane absorption is detected in the H band. Our Pleiades observations result in the detection of two substellar companions including one previously reported among 20 observed Pleiades stars, and indicate that the fraction of substellar companions in the Pleiades is about 10.0 26.1/-8.8 %.

1609.03195,astro-ph,"We measure carbon and nitrogen abundances to equation 0.1 dex for 450,000 giant stars from their low-resolution (Requation1800) LAMOST DR2 survey spectra. We use these [C/M] and [N/M] measurements, together with empirical relations based on the APOKASC sample, to infer stellar masses and implied ages for 230,000 of these objects to 0.08 dex and 0.2 dex respectively. We use The Cannon, a data-driven approach to spectral modeling, to construct a predictive model for LAMOST spectra. Our reference set comprises 8125 stars observed in common between the APOGEE and LAMOST surveys, taking seven APOGEE DR12 labels (parameters) as ground truth: Teff, logg, [M/H], [equation/M], [C/M], [N/M], and Ak. We add seven colors to the Cannon model, based on the g, r, i, J, H, K, W1, and W2 magnitudes from APASS, 2MASS & WISE, which improves our constraints on Teff and logg by up to 20% and on Ak by up to 70%. Cross-validation of the model demonstrates that, for high-SNR objects, our inferred labels agree with the APOGEE values to within 50 K in temperature, 0.04 magnitudes in Ak, and < 0.1 dex in logg, [M/H], [C/M], [N/M], and [equation/M]. We apply the model to 450,000 giants in LAMOST DR2 that have not been observed by APOGEE. This demonstrates that precise individual abundances can be measured from low-resolution spectra, and represents the largest catalog of [C/M], [N/M], masses and ages to date.

1607.06772,astro-ph,"We present a search for [CII] line and dust continuum emission from optical dropout galaxies at equation using ASPECS, our ALMA Spectroscopic Survey in the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (UDF). Our observations, which cover the frequency range equation GHz, encompass approximately the range equation for [CII] line emission and reach a limiting luminosity of Lequation(1.6-2.5)equation10equation Lequation. We identify fourteen [CII] line emitting candidates in this redshift range with significances equation4.5 equation, two of which correspond to blind detections with no optical counterparts. At this significance level, our statistical analysis shows that about 60\% of our candidates are expected to be spurious. For one of our blindly selected [CII] line candidates, we tentatively detect the CO(6-5) line in our parallel 3-mm line scan. None of the line candidates are individually detected in the 1.2 mm continuum. A stack of all [CII] candidates results in a tentative detection with equationJy. This implies a dust-obscured star formation rate (SFR) of equation Mequation yrequation. We find that the two highest--SFR objects have candidate [CII] lines with luminosities that are consistent with the low-redshift equation vs. SFR relation. The other candidates have significantly higher [CII] luminosities than expected from their UV--based SFR. At the current sensitivity it is unclear whether the majority of these sources are intrinsically bright [CII] emitters, or spurious sources. If only one of our line candidates was real (a scenario greatly favored by our statistical analysis), we find a source density for [CII] emitters at equation that is significantly higher than predicted by current models and some extrapolations from galaxies in the local universe.",16,[],1

This EPTA Data Release 1.0 extends up to mid-2014 and baselines range from 7-18 years. It forms the basis for the stochastic gravitational-wave background, anisotropic background, and continuous-wave limits recently presented by the EPTA elsewhere. The Bayesian timing analysis performed with TempoNest yields the detection of several new parameters: seven parallaxes, nine proper motions and, in the case of six binary pulsars, an apparent change of the semi-major axis.

1605.01296,astro-ph,"Reverse shock (RS) emission from Gamma Ray Bursts is an important tool in investigating the nature of the ejecta from the central engine. If the ejecta magnetization is not high enough to suppress the RS, a strong RS emission component, usually peaking in the optical/IR band early on, would give important contribution to early afterglow light curves. In the radio band, synchrotron self-absorption may suppress early RS emission, and also delay the RS peak time. In this paper, we calculate the self-absorbed RS emission in the radio band for different dynamical conditions. In particular, we stress that the RS radio emission is subject to self-absorption in both reverse and forward shocks. We calculate the ratio between the reverse to forward shock flux at the RS peak time for different frequencies, which is a measure of the detectability of the RS emission component. We then constrain the range of physical parameters for a detectable RS, in particular the role of magnetization. We notice that unlike optical RS emission which is enhanced by moderate magnetization, a moderately magnetized ejecta does not necessarily produce a brighter radio RS due to the self-absorption effect. For typical parameters, the RS emission component would not be detectable below 1 GHz unless the medium density is very low (e.g. equation for ISM and equation for wind). These predictions can be tested with the afterglow observations with current and upcoming radio facilities such as JVLA, LOFAR, FAST, and SKA.",16,[],1

1602.03085,astro-ph,"During or towards the end of inflation, the Standard Model (SM) Higgs forms a condensate with a large amplitude. Following inflation, the condensate oscillates, decaying non-perturbatively into the rest of the SM species. The resulting out-of-equilibrium dynamics converts a fraction of the energy available into gravitational waves (GW). We study this process using classical lattice simulations in an expanding box, following the energetically dominant electroweak gauge bosons equation and equation. We characterize the GW spectrum as a function of the running couplings, Higgs initial amplitude, and post-inflationary expansion rate. As long as the SM is decoupled from the inflationary sector, the generation of this background is universally expected, independently of the nature of inflation. Our study demonstrates the efficiency of GW emission by gauge fields undergoing parametric resonance. The initial energy of the Higgs condensate represents however, only a tiny fraction of the inflationary energy. Consequently, the resulting background is very suppressed, with an amplitude equation today. The amplitude can be boosted to equation, if following inflation the universe undergoes a kination-domination stage; however the background is shifted in this case to high frequencies equation. In all cases the signal is out of the range of current or planned GW detectors. This background will therefore remain, most likely, as a curiosity of the SM.",16,"['hep-ph', 'hep-th']",1

This effect is however not seen observationally or in numerical simulations. Previous attempts at reconciling the predictions with observations have proposed several mechanisms to evade the Meissner effect. In this paper, we identify a new evasion mechanism and discuss its observational significance. Specifically, we show that the breakdown of stationarity is sufficient to remove the expulsion of the magnetic field at all multipole orders, and that the associated temporal variation is likely turbulent due to the existence of efficient mechanisms for sharing energy across different modes. Such an intrinsic (as opposed to being driven externally by, e.g., changes in the accretion rate) variability of the electromagnetic field can produce the recorded linear correlation between microvariability amplitudes and mean fluxes, help create magnetic randomness and seed sheared magnetic loops in jets, and lead to a better theoretical fit to the X-ray microvariability power spectral density.",16,[],1

1605.08436,astro-ph,"We study the imprints that theories of gravity beyond GR can leave on the lensing signal around line of sight directions that are predominantly halo-underdense (called troughs) and halo-overdense. To carry out our investigations, we consider the normal branch of DGP gravity, as well as a phenomenological variant thereof that directly modifies the lensing potential. The predictions of these models are obtained with N-body simulation and ray-tracing methods using the ECOSMOG and Ray-Ramses codes. We analyse the stacked lensing convergence profiles around the underdense and overdense lines of sight, which exhibit, respectively, a suppression and a boost w.r.t. the mean in the field of view. The modifications to gravity in these models strengthen the signal w.r.t. equation in a scale-independent way. We find that the size of this effect is the same for both underdense and overdense lines of sight, which implies that the density field along the overdense directions on the sky is not sufficiently evolved to trigger the suppression effects of the screening mechanism. These results are robust to variations in the minimum halo mass and redshift ranges used to identify the lines of sight, as well as to different line of sight aperture sizes and criteria for their underdensity and overdensity thresholds.",16,[],1
1605.07635,astro-ph,"In Zombie Vortex Instability (ZVI), perturbations excite critical layers in stratified, rotating shear flow (as in protoplanetary disks), causing them to generate vortex layers, which roll-up into anticyclonic zombie vortices and cyclonic vortex sheets. The process is self-sustaining as zombie vortices perturb new critical layers, spawning a next generation of zombie vortices. Here, we focus on two issues: the minimum threshold of perturbations that trigger self-sustaining vortex generation, and the properties of the late-time zombie turbulence on large and small scales. The critical parameter that determines whether ZVI is triggered is the magnitude of the vorticity on the small scales (and not velocity), the minimum Rossby number needed for instability is equation for equation, where equation is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency. While the threshold is set by vorticity, it is useful to infer a criterion on the Mach number, for Kolmogorov noise, the critical Mach number scales with Reynolds number: equation. In protoplanetary disks, this is equation. On large scales, zombie turbulence is characterized by anticyclones and cyclonic sheets with typical Rossby number equation0.3. The spacing of the cyclonic sheets and anticyclones appears to have a ""memory"" of the spacing of the critical layers. On the small scales, zombie turbulence has no memory of the initial conditions and has a Kolmogorov-like energy spectrum. While our earlier work was in the limit of uniform stratification, we have demonstrated that ZVI works for non-uniform Brunt-Vaisala frequency profiles that may be found in protoplanetary disks.",16,[],1
1601.02816,astro-ph,"While nobody would deny the presence of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in the power density spectrum of Black hole binaries nor their importance in the understanding of the mechanisms powering the X-ray emissions, the possible impact on the time-averaged disk energy spectrum from the phenomenon responsible for the Quasi-Periodic Oscillations is largely ignored in models of sources emission. Here we investigate the potential impact of such structure on the resultant energy spectrum. Using data from the well documented outbursts of XTE Jequation-equation we looked at possible hints that the presence of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations actually impacts the energy spectrum emitted by the source. In particular we look at the evolution of the relation between the inner disc radius and the inner disc temperature obtained from fits to the spectral data. We then test this further by developing a simple model in order to simulate spectra of a disk with a structure mimicking an increasing in strength Quasi-Periodic Oscillation and compare the simulated results to those obtained from real data. We detect a similar departure in the inner radius - inner temperature curve coming from the standard fit of our simulated observations as is seen in   XTE Jequation-equation data. We interpret our results as evidence that the structure at the origin of the Quasi-Periodic Oscillation impact the energy spectrum. Furthermore, in states with a significant disk emission the inaccuracy of the determination of the disk parameters increases with the strength of the Quasi-Periodic Oscillation, an increase which then renders the value given by the fit unreliable for strong Quasi-Periodic Oscillation.",16,[],1
1611.05882,astro-ph,"Determining the average fraction of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons escaping high redshift galaxies is essential for understanding how reionization proceeded in the z>6 Universe. We want to measure the LyC signal from a sample of sources in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) and COSMOS fields for which ultra-deep VIMOS spectroscopy as well as multi-wavelength Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging are available.   We select a sample of 46 galaxies at equation from the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS) database, such that the VUDS spectra contain the LyC part of the spectra, that is, the rest-frame range equation. Taking advantage of the HST imaging, we apply a careful cleaning procedure and reject all the sources showing nearby clumps with different colours, that could potentially be lower-redshift interlopers. After this procedure, the sample is reduced to 33 galaxies. We measure the ratio between ionizing flux (LyC at equation) and non-ionizing emission (at equation) for all individual sources. We also produce a normalized stacked spectrum of all sources. Assuming an intrinsic average equation of 3, we estimate the individual and average relative escape fraction. We do not detect ionizing radiation from any individual source, although we identify a possible LyC emitter with very high Lyequation equivalent width (EW). From the stacked spectrum and assuming a mean transmissivity for the sample, we measure a relative escape fraction equation. We also look for correlations between the limits in the LyC flux and source properties and find a tentative correlation between LyC flux and the EW of the Lyequation emission line.   Our results imply that the LyC flux emitted by equation star-forming galaxies at zequation4 is at most very modest, in agreement with previous upper limits from studies based on broad and narrow band imaging.",16,[],1
1603.09332,astro-ph,"We fit an Extended Distribution Function (EDF) to K giants in the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE) survey. These stars are detected to radii ~80 kpc and span a wide range in [Fe/H]. Our EDF, which depends on [Fe/H] in addition to actions, encodes the entanglement of metallicity with dynamics within the Galaxy's stellar halo. Our maximum-likelihood fit of the EDF to the data allows us to model the survey's selection function. The density profile of the K giants steepens with radius from a slope ~-2 to ~-4 at large radii. The halo's axis ratio increases with radius from 0.7 to almost unity. The metal-rich stars are more tightly confined in action space than the metal-poor stars and form a more flattened structure. A weak metallicity gradient ~-0.001 dex/kpc, a small gradient in the dispersion in [Fe/H] of ~0.001 dex/kpc, and a higher degree of radial anistropy in metal-richer stars result. Lognormal components with peaks at ~-1.5 and ~-2.3 are required to capture the overall metallicity distribution, suggestive of the existence of two populations of K giants. The spherical anisotropy parameter varies between 0.3 in the inner halo to isotropic in the outer halo. If the Sagittarius stream is included, a very similar model is found but with a stronger degree of radial anisotropy throughout.",16,[],1

We collate a sample of equation 400,000 central and equation 100,000 satellite galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7). Specifically, we consider central velocity dispersion (equation), stellar, halo, bulge and disk mass, local density, bulge-to-total ratio, group-centric distance and galaxy-halo mass ratio. We develop and apply a new statistical technique to quantify the impact on the quenched fraction (equation) of varying one parameter, while keeping the remaining parameters fixed. For centrals, we find that the equation relationship is tighter and steeper than for any other variable considered. We compare to the Illustris hydrodynamical simulation and the Munich semi-analytic model (L-Galaxies), finding that our results for centrals are qualitatively consistent with their predictions for quenching via radio-mode AGN feedback, hinting at the viability of this process in explaining our observational trends. However, we also find evidence that quenching in L-Galaxies is too efficient and quenching in Illustris is not efficient enough, compared to observations. For satellites, we find strong evidence that environment affects their quenched fraction at fixed central velocity dispersion, particularly at lower masses. At higher masses, satellites behave identically to centrals in their quenching. Of the environmental parameters considered, local density affects the quenched fraction of satellites the most at fixed central velocity dispersion.",16,[],1

1608.04735,astro-ph,"A model for the acoustic production of gravitational waves at a first order phase transition is presented. The source of gravitational radiation is the sound waves generated by the explosive growth of bubbles of the stable phase. The model assumes that the sound waves are linear and that their power spectrum is determined by the characteristic form of the sound shell around the expanding bubble. The predicted power spectrum has two length scales, the average bubble separation and the sound shell width when the bubbles collide. The peak of the power spectrum is at wavenumbers set by the sound shell width. For higher wavenumber equation, the power spectrum decreases as equation. At wavenumbers below the inverse bubble separation, the power spectrum goes as equation. For bubble wall speeds near the speed of sound where these two length scales are distinguished, there is an intermediate equation power law. The detailed dependence of the power spectrum on the wall speed and the other parameters of the phase transition raises the possibility of their constraint or measurement at a future space-based gravitational wave observatory such as eLISA.",16,['hep-ph'],1

Our results confirm the importance of partial redistribution effects in the formation of the Mg II h and k lines, as pointed out by previous work in the non-magnetic case. We show that the presence of a magnetic field can produce measurable modifications of the broadband linear polarization even for relatively small field strengths (~10 G), while the circular polarization remains well represented by the classical magnetograph formula. Both these results open an important new window for the weak-field diagnostics of the upper solar atmosphere.",16,[],1
1605.09424,astro-ph,"Microvariability (intra-night variability) is a low amplitude flux change at short time scales (i.e. hours). It has been detected in unobscured type 1 AGNs and blazars. However in type 2 AGNs, the detection is hampered by the low contrast between the presumably variable nucleus and the host galaxy. In this paper, we present a search for microvariability in a sample of four type 2 quasars as an astrostatistical problem. We are exploring the use of a newly introduced enhanced F-test, proposed by de Diego 2014. The presented results show that out of our four observed targets, we were able to apply this statistical method to three of them. Evidence of microvariations is clear in the case of quasar J08022552 in all used filters (g',r' and i') during both observing nights, the microvariations are present in one of the nights of observations of J12585239 in one filter (i'), while for the J13164452, there is evidence for microvariability within our detection levels during one night and two filters (r' and i'). We demonstrate the feasibility of the enhanced F-test to detect microvariability in obscured type 2 quasars. At the end of this paper, we discuss possible causes of microvariability. One of the options is the misclassification of the targets. A likely scenario for explanation of the phenomenon involves optically thin gaps in a clumpy obscuring medium, in accordance with the present view of the circumnuclear region. There is a possible interesting connection between the merging state of the targets and detection of microvariability.",16,[],1
1609.07325,astro-ph,"ESA recently called for new ""Science Ideas"" to be investigated in terms of feasibility and technological developments -- for technologies not yet sufficiently mature. These ideas may in the future become candidates for M or L class missions within the ESA Science Program.   With the launch of Gaia in December 2013, Europe entered a new era of space astrometry following in the footsteps of the very successful Hipparcos mission from the early 1990s. Gaia is the successor to Hipparcos, both of which operated in optical wavelengths, and Gaia is two orders of magnitude more accurate in the five astrometric parameters and is surveying four orders of magnitude more stars in a vast volume of the Milky Way. The combination of the Hipparcos/Tycho-2 catalogues with the first early Gaia data release will give improved proper motions over a long ~25 year baseline. The final Gaia solution will also establish a new optical reference frame by means of quasars, by linking the optical counterparts of radio (VLBI) sources defining the orientation of the reference frame, and by using the zero proper motion of quasars to determine a non-rotating frame.   A weakness of Gaia is that it only operates at optical wavelengths. However, much of the Galactic centre and the spiral arm regions, important for certain studies, are obscured by interstellar extinction and this makes it difficult for Gaia to deeply probe. Traditionally, this problem is overcome by switching to the infra-red but this was not possible with Gaia's CCDs. Additionally, to scan the entire sky and make global absolute parallax measurements the spacecraft must have a constant rotation and this requires that the CCDs operate in TDI mode, increasing their complexity.",16,[],1
1612.06296,astro-ph,"We derive constraints on feedback by active galactic nuclei (AGN) by setting limits on their thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) imprint on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The amplitude of any SZ signature is small and degenerate with the poorly known sub-mm spectral energy distribution of the AGN host galaxy and other unresolved dusty sources along the line of sight. Here we break this degeneracy by combining microwave and sub-mm data from Planck with all-sky far-infrared maps from the AKARI satellite. We first test our measurement pipeline using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redMaPPer catalogue of galaxy clusters, finding a highly significant detection (equationequation) of the SZ effect together with correlated dust emission. We then constrain the SZ signal associated with spectroscopically confirmed quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) from SDSS data release 7 (DR7) and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) DR12. We obtain a low-significance (equation) hint of an SZ signal, pointing towards a mean thermal energy of equation erg, lower than reported in some previous studies. A comparison of our results with high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations including AGN feedback suggests QSO host masses of equation, but with a large uncertainty. Our analysis provides no conclusive evidence for an SZ signal specifically associated with AGN feedback.",16,[],1

We report the detection of several transitions of PN and, for the first time, of prebiotic molecule PO. None of these species are detected towards the driving protostar of the outflow L1157-mm. Analysis of the line profiles shows that PN arises from the outflow cavity, where SiO, a strong shock tracer, is produced. Radiative transfer analysis yields an abundance of 2.5e-9 and 0.9e-9 for PO and PN, respectively. These results imply a strong depletion (approx 100) of Phosphorus in the quiescent cloud gas. Shock modelling shows that atomic N plays a major role in the chemistry of PO and PN. The relative abundance of PO and PN brings constraints both on the duration of the pre-shock phase, which has to be about 1 Myr, and on the shock parameters. The maximum temperature in the shock has to be larger than 4000K, which implies a shock velocity of 40 km/s.",16,[],1

In the power density spectrum, a break appears at the pulse frequency which separates the zero slope at low frequency from the steeper slope at high frequency.

We combine H-alpha dynamical maps from the VLT/FLAMES multi-IFU system with far-infrared imaging using Herschel SPIRE and millimetre spectroscopy from IRAM/NOEMA, in order to measure the dynamics, star formation rates and gas masses of this sample. Most galaxies appear to be rotationally supported, with a median ratio of rotational support to line-of-sight velocity dispersion v/sigma ~ 5 /- 2, and specific angular momentum lambdaR = 0.83 /- 0.06 - comparable to field spirals of a similar mass at this redshift. The star formation rates of 3 - 26 Msolar/yr and average 12 CO derived gas mass of 1 x 1010 Msolar suggest gas depletion timescales of ~ 1Gyr (~ 0.25 of the cluster crossing time). We derive characteristic dust temperatures (mean Tdust = 26 /- 1 K) consistent with local galaxies of similar far-infrared luminosity, suggesting that the low density gas is yet to be stripped. Taken together, these results suggest that these starbursts have only recently accreted from the field, with star formation rates likely enhanced due to the effects of ram pressure. In order to make the transition to cluster S0s these galaxies must lose ~ 40% of their specific angular momentum.

The WD is a nearly perpendicular rotator, with both open field line beams sweeping the MD stellar wind periodically. A bow shock propagating into the stellar wind accelerates electrons in the wind.

Finally, we describe how multi-wavelength observations of different external macroscopic features (e.g. maximum mass, surface temperature, pulsar glitches) can give invaluable information about the exotic internal microscopic scenario: super-dense, isospin-asymmetric, superfluid, bulk hadronic matter (probably deconfined in the most central regions) which can be found nowhere else in the Universe. Indeed, neutrons stars represent a unique probe to study the properties of the low-temperature, high-density sector of the QCD phase diagram.

We make use of a sample of 11 powerful radio galaxies spanning 1<z<4 which have complete coverage of their spectral energy distribution (SED) from UV to FIR wavelengths. Using Herschel data, we disentangle the relative contribution of the AGN and star formation by combining the galaxyevolutioncodePEGASE.3 with an AGN torus model. We find that three components are necessary to reproduce the observed SEDs: an evolved and massive stellar component, a submm bright young starburst, and an AGN torus. We find that powerful radio galaxies form at very high-redshift, but experience episodic and important growth at 1<z<4 as the mass of the associated starburst varies from 5 to 50% of the total mass of the system. The properties of star formation differ from source to source, indicating no general trend of the star formation properties in the most infrared luminous high-redshift radio galaxies and no correlation with the AGN bolometric luminosity.

Computation of such sequences is important to study millisecond pulsars and other fast spinning compact stars. Our EoS models can support a gravitational mass (MG) and a spin frequency at least up to approximately 3.0 solar mass and approximately 1250 Hz respectively, and hence are fully consistent with measured MG and spin frequency values. This paper reports the effects of Beff and a4 on measurable compact star properties, which could be useful to find possible ways to constrain these fundamental quark matter parameters, within the ambit of our EoS models. We confirm that a lower Beff allows a higher mass. Besides, for known MG and spin frequency, measurable parameters, such as stellar radius, radius-to-mass ratio and moment of inertia, increase with the decrease of Beff. Our calculations also show that a4 significantly affects the stellar rest mass and the total stellar binding energy. As a result, a4 can have signatures in evolutions of both accreting and non-accreting compact stars, and the observed distribution of stellar mass and spin and other source parameters.

We have collected intermediate-resolution spectra of thirty-one young star candidates in the periphery of the LMC and measured their radial velocity, stellar parameters, distance and age. Our measurements confirm membership to the LMC of six targets, for which the radial velocity and distance values match well those of the Cloud. These objects are all young (10-50 Myr), main-sequence stars projected between 7 and 13 degrees from the center of the parent galaxy. We compare the velocities of our stars with those of a disk model, and find that our stars have low to moderate velocity differences with the disk model predictions, indicating that they were formed in situ. Our study demonstrates that recent star formation occurred in the far periphery of the LMC, where thus far only old objects were known. The spatial configuration of these newly-formed stars appears ring-like with a radius of 12 kpc, and a displacement of 2.6 kpc from the LMC's center.

1602.05836,astro-ph,"Observationally, weak lensing has been served so far by optical surveys due to the much larger number densities of background galaxies achieved, which is typically by two to three orders of magnitude compared to radio. However, the high sensitivity of the new generation of radio telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will provide a density of detected galaxies that is comparable to that found at optical wavelengths, and with significant source shape measurements to make large area radio surveys competitive for weak lensing studies. This will lead weak lensing to become one of the primary science drivers in radio surveys too, with the advantage that they will access the largest scales in the Universe going beyond optical surveys, like LSST and Euclid, in terms of redshifts that are probed. RadioLensfit is an adaptation to radio data of ""lensfit"", a model-fitting approach for galaxy shear measurement, originally developed for optical weak lensing surveys. Its key advantage is working directly in the visibility domain, which is the natural approach to adopt with radio data, avoiding systematics due to the imaging process.

The method relies on three key ingredients: (1) a well established emission continuum level; (2) a robust grid of photoionisation models spanning several orders of magnitude in gas density (equation), plasma column density (equation), and in ionization states; (3) theoretical curves of growth for a large set of atomic lines. By comparing theoretical and observed equivalent widths of a large set of lines, spanning highly ionized charge states from O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, and the Fe L-shell and K-shell, we are able to infer the location of the X-ray warm absorber.",16,[],1
1604.03550,astro-ph,"The young associations offer us one of the best opportunities to study the properties of young stellar and substellar objects and to directly image planets thanks to their proximity (equation200 pc) and age (equation5-150 Myr). However, many previous works have been limited to identifying the brighter, more active members (equation1 Mequation) owing to photometric survey sensitivities limiting the detections of lower mass objects. We search the field of view of 542 previously identified members of the young associations to identify wide or extremely wide (1000-100,000 au in physical separation) companions. We combined 2MASS near-infrared photometry (equation, equation, equation) with proper motion values (from UCAC4, PPMXL, NOMAD) to identify companions in the field of view of known members. We collated further photometry and spectroscopy from the literature and conducted our own high-resolution spectroscopic observations for a subsample of candidate members. This complementary information allowed us to assess the efficiency of our method. We identified 84 targets (45: 0.2-1.3 Mequation, 17: 0.08-0.2 Mequation, 22: equation0.08 Mequation) in our analysis, ten of which have been identified from spectroscopic analysis in previous young association works. For 33 of these 84, we were able to further assess their membership using a variety of properties (X-ray emission, UV excess, Hequation, lithium and K I equivalent widths, radial velocities, and CaH indices). We derive a success rate of 76-88% for this technique based on the consistency of these properties. Once confirmed, the targets identified in this work would significantly improve our knowledge of the lower mass end of the young associations. Additionally, these targets would make an ideal new sample for the identification and study of planets around nearby young stars.",16,[],1
1606.05266,astro-ph,"We discuss how the centres of galaxy clusters evolve in time, showing the results of a series of direct N-body simulations. In particular, we followed the evolution of a galaxy cluster with a mass equationMequation in different configurations. The dynamical evolution of the system leads in all the cases to the formation of dense and massive sub-structures in the cluster centre, that form in consequence of a series of collisions and merging among galaxies travelling in the cluster core. We investigate how the structural properties of the main merging product depends on the characteristics of those galaxies that contributed to its formation.",16,[],1
1606.04489,astro-ph,"The interaction of cosmic rays with the gas contained in our Galaxy is a guaranteed source of diffuse high energy neutrinos. We provide expectations for this component by considering different assumptions for the cosmic ray distribution in the Galaxy which are intended to cover the large uncertainty in cosmic ray propagation models. We calculate the angular dependence of the diffuse galactic neutrino flux and the corresponding rate of High Energy Starting Events in IceCube by including the effect of detector angular resolution. Moreover we discuss the possibility to discriminate the galactic component from an isotropic astrophysical flux. We show that a statistically significant excess of events from the galactic plane in present IceCube data would favour models in which the cosmic ray density in the inner galactic region is much larger than its local value, thus bringing relevant information on the cosmic ray radial distribution.",16,['hep-ph'],1
1602.04826,astro-ph,"We investigate the complex interactions between the stellar disc and the dark-matter halo during bar formation and evolution using N-body simulations with fine temporal resolution and optimally chosen spatial resolution. We find that the forming stellar bar traps dark matter in the vicinity of the stellar bar into bar-supporting orbits. We call this feature the shadow bar. The shadow bar modifies both the location and magnitude of the angular momentum transfer between the disc and dark matter halo and adds 10 per cent to the mass of the stellar bar over 4 Gyr. The shadow bar is potentially observable by its density and velocity signature in spheroid stars and by direct dark matter detection experiments. Numerical tests demonstrate that the shadow bar can diminish the rate of angular momentum transport from the bar to the dark matter halo by more than a factor of three over the rate predicted by dynamical friction with an untrapped dark halo, and thus provides a possible physical explanation for the observed prevalence of fast bars in nature.",16,[],1
1601.05289,astro-ph,"A strong outburst of the X-ray transient V404 Cygni (= GS2023-338) was observed in 2015 June/July up to a level of 50 Crab in the hard X-ray domain. At this level of photon flux, an instrument's behavior may be severely tested and some instrumental artifacts could affect the data analysis. We are interested in the SPI instrument aboard the INTEGRAL mission and have performed thorough checks to ensure a correct handling of the data. By analyzing the observations throughout the outburst, we have observed that the high energy domain (above 500 keV) sometimes exhibits unexpected features which are worth careful examination. Spurious triggers are known to affect the MeV region and we suspected that this phenomenon could be accentuated by the huge photon flux. We have investigated this issue, specifically during high flux periods and actually found that artificial high energy bumps may appear with the current standard analysis procedure. However, if the specific selection events usually used in the 650-2200 keV energy is applied down to 450 keV, the spurious noise and the associated spectral features are removed. We present how to obtain reliable spectral results on the high energy emission of V404 Cyg at extreme flux levels and demonstrate that with the correct configuration, the hard X-ray emission, up to a few MeV, is modeled by a two component model as observed in Cyg X-1 and for V404 Cygni itself at lower flux levels.",16,[],1
1602.04362,astro-ph,"Clouds have been shown to be present in many exoplanetary atmospheres. Cloud formation modeling predicts considerable inhomogeneities of cloud cover, consistent with optical phase curve observations. However, optical phase curves cannot resolve some existing degeneracies between cloud location and cloud optical properties.   We present a conceptually simple technique to detect inhomogeneous cloud cover on exoplanets. Such an inhomogeneous cloud cover produces an asymmetric primary transit of the planet in front of the host star. Asymmetric transits produce characteristic residuals compared to a standard symmetric model. Furthermore, bisector spans can be used to determine asymmetries in the transit light curve.   We apply a model of asymmetric transits to the light curves of HAT-P-7b, Kepler-7b and HD209458b and search for possible cloud signatures. The nearly uninterrupted Kepler photometry is particularly well-suited for this method since it allows for a very high time resolution.   We do not find any statistically sound cloud signature in the data of the considered planets. For HAT-P-7b, a tentative detection of an asymmetric cloud cover is found, consistent with analysis of the optical phase curve. Based on Bayesian probability arguments, a symmetric model with an offset in the transit ephemeris remains, however, the most viable model. Still, this work demonstrates that for suitable targets, namely low-gravity planets around bright stars, the method can be used to constrain cloud cover characteristics and is thus a helpful additional tool to study exoplanetary atmospheres.",16,[],1
1606.02285,astro-ph,"We present a study of the detectability of CO molecules in the Galactic interstellar medium using high-resolution X-ray spectra obtained with the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer. We analyzed 10 bright low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) to study the CO contribution in their line-of-sights. A total of 25 observations were fitted with the ISMabs X-ray absorption model which includes photoabsorption cross-sections for O I, O II, O III and CO. We performed a Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation analysis of the goodness of fit in order to estimate the significance of the CO detection. We determine that the statistical analysis prevents a significant detection of CO molecular X-ray absorption features, except for the lines-of-sight toward XTE~J1718-330 and 4U~1636-53. In the case of XTE~J1817-330, this is the first report of the presence of CO along its line-of-sight. Our results reinforce the conclusion that molecules have a minor contribution to the absorption features in the O K-edge spectral region. We estimate a CO column density lower limit to perform a significant detection with XMM-Newton of N(CO) > 6x1016 cm-2 for typical exposure times",16,[],1
1611.09581,astro-ph,"We report HequationO maser line observations of the bright-rimmed globule IC 1396 N using a ground-space interferometer with the 10-m RadioAstron radio telescope as the space-based element. The source was not detected on projected baselines >2.3 Earth diameters, which indicates a lower limit on the maser size of L >0.03 AU and an upper limit on the brightness temperature of 6.25 x 10equation K. Positions and flux densities of maser spots were determined by fringe rate mapping. Multiple low-velocity features from -4.5 km/s to 0.7 km/s are seen, and two high-velocity features of Vequation=-9.4 km/s and 4.4 km/s are found at projected distances of 157 AU and 70 AU, respectively, from the strongest low-velocity feature at Vequation=equation0.3 km/s. Maser components from the central part of the spectrum fall into four velocity groups but into three spatial groups. Three spatial groups of low-velocity features detected in the 2014 observations are arranged in a linear structure about 200 AU in length. Two of these groups were not detected in 1996 and possibly are jets which formed between 1996 and 2014. The putative jet seems to have changed direction in 18 years, which we explain by the precession of the jet under the influence of the gravity of material surrounding the globule. The jet collimation can be provided by a circumstellar protoplanetary disk. There is a straight line orientation in the Vequation-Right Ascension diagram between the jet and the maser group at Vequation=equation0.3 km/s. However, the central group with the same position but at the velocity Vequationequation-3.4 km/s falls on a straight line between two high-velocity components detected in 2014. Comparison of the low-velocity positions from 2014 and 1996, based on the same diagram, shows that the majority of the masers maintain their positions near the central velocity Vequation=equation0.3 km/s during the 18 year period.",16,[],1
1607.06464,astro-ph,"We present ALMA ultra-high-spatial resolution (equation) observations of dust continuum at equation and equation in a pair of submm galaxies (SMGs) at equation, ALMACAL-1 (A-1: equation) and ALMACAL-2 (A-2: equation). The spectroscopic redshifts of A-1 and A-2 have been confirmed via serendipitous detection of up to nine emission lines. Our ultra-high-spatial resolution data reveal that about half of the star formation in each of these starbursts is dominated by a single compact clump (FWHM size of equation). This structure is confirmed by independent datasets at equation and equation. The star-formation rate (SFR) surface densities of all these clumps are extremely high, equation to equation, the highest found in high-redshift galaxies. There is a small probability that A-1 and A-2 are the lensed components of a background source gravitationally amplified by the blazar host. If this was the case, the effective radius of the source would be equation, and the de-magnified SFR surface density would be equation, comparable with the eastern nucleus of Arp 220. Despite being unable to rule out an AGN contribution, our results suggest that a significant percentage of the enormous far-IR luminosity in some dusty starbursts is concentrated in very small star-forming regions. The high equation in our pair of SMGs could only be measured thanks to the ultra-high-resolution ALMA observations used in this work, demonstrating that long-baseline observations are essential to study and interpret the properties of dusty starbursts in the early Universe.",16,[],1

1603.03222,astro-ph,"The gravitationally-lensed galaxy A1689-zD1 is one of the most distant spectroscopically confirmed sources (equation). It is the earliest known galaxy where the interstellar medium (ISM) has been detected; dust emission was detected with the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA). A1689-zD1 is also unusual among high-redshift dust emitters as it is a sub-L* galaxy and is therefore a good prospect for the detection of gaseous ISM in a more typical galaxy at this redshift. We observed A1689-zD1 with ALMA in bands 6 and 7 and with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in band equation. To study the structure of A1689-zD1, we map the mm thermal dust emission and find two spatial components with sizes about equation\,kpc (lensing-corrected). The rough spatial morphology is similar to what is observed in the near-infrared with \it HST and points to a perturbed dynamical state, perhaps indicative of a major merger or a disc in early formation. The ALMA photometry is used to constrain the far-infrared spectral energy distribution, yielding a dust temperature (equation--equation\,K for equation). We do not detect the CO(3-2) line in the GBT data with a 95\% upper limit of 0.3\,mJy observed. We find a slight excess emission in ALMA band~6 at 220.9\,GHz. If this excess is real, it is likely due to emission from the [CII] 158.8\,equationm line at equation. The stringent upper limits on the [CII]/equation luminosity ratio suggest a [CII] deficit similar to several bright quasars and massive starbursts.",16,[],1
1609.05748,astro-ph,"Wide-field (> 100 degequation) hard X-ray coded-aperture telescopes with high angular resolution (< 2') will enable a wide range of time domain astrophysics. For instance, transient sources such as gamma-ray bursts can be precisely localized without assistance of secondary focusing X-ray telescopes to enable rapid followup studies. On the other hand, high angular resolution in coded-aperture imaging introduces a new challenge in handling the systematic uncertainty: average photon count per pixel is often too small to establish a proper background pattern or model the systematic uncertainty in a time scale where the model remains invariant. We introduce two new techniques to improve detection sensitivity, which are designed for, but not limited to high resolution coded-aperture system: a self-background modeling scheme which utilizes continuous scan or dithering operations, and a Poisson-statistics based probabilistic approach to evaluate the significance of source detection without subtraction in handling the background. We illustrate these new imaging analysis techniques in high resolution coded-aperture telescope using the data acquired by the wide-field hard X-ray telescope ProtoEXIST2 during the high-altitude balloon flight in Fall, 2012. We review the imaging sensitivity of ProtoEXIST2 during the flight, and demonstrate the performance of the new techniques using our balloon flight data in comparison with simulated ideal Poisson background.",16,[],1

We determine, as a function of equation, the minimum value for stability of the anisotropy radius equation and of the maximum value of the associated stability indicator equation. We find that, for decreasing equation, equation decreases and equation increases, i.e. longer-range forces are more robust against radial-orbit instability.

Using the beam-forming mode of the LWA1 we have also captured the broadband spectra between 22.0 and 55.0 MHz of four events. We compare the smooth, spectral components of these four events and fit the frequency dependent flux density to a power law, and find that the spectral index is time variable, with the spectrum steepening over time for each meteor afterglow.

We aim to investigate the importance of stellar abundance proxies for the planetary bulk composition (namely Fe/Si and Mg/Si) on prediction of planetary interiors. We performed a full probabilistic Bayesian inference analysis to formally account for observational and model uncertainties while obtaining confidence regions of structural and compositional parameters of core, mantle, ice layer, ocean, and atmosphere. We determined how sensitive our parameter predictions depend on (1) different estimates of bulk abundance constraints and (2) different correlations of bulk abundances between planet and host star. [...] Although the possible ranges of interior structures are large, structural parameters and their correlations are constrained by the sparse data.

1602.07698,astro-ph,"We explore full/partial tidal disruption events (TDEs) of stars/planets by stellar compact objects (Black holes; BHs; or neutron stars; NSs), which we term micro-TDEs. Disruption of a star/planet with mass equation may lead to the formation of a debris disk around the BH/NS. Efficient accretion of a fraction equation of the debris may then give rise to bright energetic long (equation), X-ray/Gamma-ray flares, with total energies of up to equationergs, possibly resembling ultra-long GRBs/XRFs. The energy of such flares depends on the poorly constrained accretion processes. Significantly fainter flares might be produced if most of the disk mass is blown away through strong outflows. We suggest three dynamical origins for such disruptions. In the first, a star/planet is tidally disrupted following a close random encounter with a BH/NS in a dense cluster. We estimate the BH (NS) micro-TDE rates from this scenario to be fewequation (fewequation) equation per Milky-Way galaxy. Another scenario involves the interaction of wide companions due to perturbations by stars in the field, likely producing comparable but lower rates. Finally, a third scenario involves a BH/NS which gain a natal velocity kick at birth, leading to a close encounter with a binary companion and the tidal disruption of that companion. Such events could be associated with a supernova, or even with a preceding GRB/XRF event, and would likely occur hours to days after the prompt explosion; the rates of such events could be larger than those obtained from the other scenarios, depending on the preceding complex binary stellar evolution.",16,[],1

The behavior of FeSeequationSequation is well described by the simple two band model with comparable values of hole and electron mobility. In particular, at low temperatures the transverse resistance shows a linear field dependence, the magnetoresistance follow a quadratic field dependence and obeys to Kohler's rule. In contrast, Kohler's rule is strongly violated for samples having an orthorhombic low temperature structure. However, the transport properties of the orthorhombic samples can be satisfactory described by the three band model with the pair of almost equivalent to the tetragonal sample hole and electron bands, supplemented with the highly mobile electron band which has two order smaller carrier number. Therefore, the peculiarity of the low temperature transport properties of the orthorhombic Fe(SeS) samples, as probably of many other orthorhombic iron superconductors, is due to the presence of a small number of highly mobile carriers which originate from the local regions of the Fermi surface, presumably, nearby the Van Hove singularity points.",16,[],8

By carefully analyzing the natural nonlocal anisotropic optical conductivity of BP, derived using the Kubo formalism and an effective low-energy Hamiltonian, we demonstrate here that the SPP wavenumber cutoff imposed by nonlocality prohibits that they acquire an arbitrary hyperbolic topology, forcing operation in the canalization regime. The resulting nonlocality-induced canalization presents interesting properties, as it is inherently broadband, enables large light-matter interactions in the very near field, and allows extreme device miniaturization. We also determine fundamental bounds to the confinement of BP plasmons, which are significantly weaker than for graphene, thus allowing a larger local density of states.

1607.04355,cond-mat,"We develop a segment-scale, force-based theory for the breakdown of the unentangled Rouse model and subsequent emergence of isotropic mesoscopic localization and entropic elasticity in chain polymer liquids in the absence of ergodicity-restoring anisotropic reptation motion. The theory is formulated in terms of a conformational N-dynamic-order-parameter Generalized Langevin Equation approach. It is implemented using a field-theoretic Gaussian thread model of polymer structure and closed in a universal manner at the level of the chain dynamic second moment matrix. The physical idea is that the isotropic Rouse model fails due to the dynamical emergence of time-persistent intermolecular contacts determined by the combined influence of local chain uncrossability, long range polymer connectivity and a self-consistent treatment of chain motion and the dynamic forces that hinder it. For long chain melts, the mesoscopic localization length (tube diameter) and emergent elasticity predictions are in near quantitative agreement with experiment. Moreover, the onset chain length scales with the semi-dilute crossover concentration with a realistic numerical prefactor. Distinctive predictions are made for various off-diagonal correlation functions that quantify the full spatial structure of the dynamically localized polymer conformation. As the local uncrossability constraint and/or intrachain bonding spring are softened, the tube diameter is predicted to swell until it reaches the chain radius-of-gyration at which point entanglement localization vanishes in a discontinuous manner. A full dynamic phase diagram for the destruction of mesoscopic localization is constructed, which is qualitatively consistent with simulations and the classical concept of an entanglement degree of polymerization.",16,[],8
1610.08588,cond-mat,"New crystal structures of fully hydrogenated borophene (borophane) have been predicted by first principles calculation. Comparing with the chair-like borophane (C-boropane) that has been reported in literature, we obtained four new borophane conformers with much lower total-energy. The most stable one, washboard-like borophane (W-borophane), has energy about 113.41 meV/atom lower than C-borophane. In order to explain the relative stability of different borophane conformers, the atom configuration, density of states, charge transfer, charge density distribution and defect formation energy of B-H dimer have been calculated. The results show that the charge transfer from B atoms to H atoms is crucial for the stability of borophane. In different borophane conformers, the bonding characteristics between B and H atoms are similar, but the B-B bonds in W-borophane are much stronger than that in C-borophane or other structures. In addition, we examined the dynamical stability of borophane conformers by phonon dispersions and found that the four new conformers are all dynamically stable. Finally the mechanical properties of borophane conformers along an arbitrary direction have been discussed. W-borophane possesses unique electronic structure (Dirac cone), good stability and superior mechanical properties. W-borophane has broad perspective for nano electronic device.",16,['physics'],8

The different structures show vastly different properties. For example, the 2H MoTe2 ML is a direct-gap semiconductor while 1T' MoTe2 is a semi-metal. It has been suggested that the formation energies between 2H and 1T' MoTe2 differ very little, so there is a high chance to tune the structures of MoTe2 and thereby to bring in new applications such as phase-change electronics.

1602.01574,cond-mat,"This work addresses the effect of substituting Mnequation by Feequation at the octahedral site of TbMnOequation on the magnetic phase sequence, ferroelectric and magnetoelectric properties, keeping the Feequation concentration below 5%. The temperature dependence of the specific heat, dielectric permittivity and electric polarization was studied as a function of Feequation concentration and applied magnetic field. From the experimental results a strong decrease of the electric polarization with increasing Feequation substitution is observed, vanishing above a concentration of 4%. However, within this range, a significant increase of the magnetic sensitivity of the electric polarization is obtained by increasing Feequation concentration. Above that value, a non-polar, weak ferromagnetic phase emerges, in good agreement with the predictions of the Dzyalowshinskii-Moriya model. This behavior reveals the crucial effect of Feequation substitution in octahedral sites on the magnetic phase sequence, polar and magnetoelectric behavior of the TbMnequationFeequationOequation system.

This universality class also includes two equilibrium systems : two-dimensional smectic liquid crystals, and a peculiar kind of constrained two-dimensional ferromagnet. We use these connections to show that two-dimensional incompressible flocks are robust against fluctuations, and exhibit universal long-ranged, anisotropic spatio-temporal correlations of those fluctuations.

We find that these effects can be prominent in typical materials (e.g. silica and sapphire) at separations of tens of nanometers, and can play an even larger role in metal oxides, which exhibit moderate conductivities and enhanced radiative properties. Broadly speaking, these predictions suggest that the impact of RHT on thermal conduction, and vice versa, could manifest itself as a limit on the possible magnitude of RHT at the nanoscale, which asymptotes to a constant (the conductive transfer rate when the gap is closed) instead of diverging at short separations.",16,[],8

The importance of one-body losses is highlighted without which population trapping behavior would be observed. The model is written with decay constants expressed through experimental parameters. It can complement, e.g., the ISRE (identical spin rotation effect) model to improve its predictions: ISRE dramatically increases the ensemble coherence time, hence it enables one to observe the influence of two-body losses on the interferometry contrast envelope.

The superconductivity is driven by the pair condensation of these coherent parts of the physical electrons.

A novel iterative procedure for describing such systems is developed, starting from a correlated mean-field approximation, allowing for a systematic derivation of higher orders, and meeting no problems listed above.

Renormalization group calculations in equation dimensions provide an explanation of these results as arising due to the existence of an equation that separates the fate of the flows with easy-plane anisotropy. When equation the renormalization group flows to a discontinuity fixed point and hence a first order transition arises. On the other hand, for equation the flows are to a new easy-plane equation fixed point that describes the quantum criticality in the lattice model at large equation. Our lattice model at its critical point thus gives efficient numerical access to a new strongly coupled gauge-matter field theory.",16,[],8

We find an extended region of the diagram exhibiting a two-flavors superfluid symmetry-locking (TSFL) phase. This phase is present also for not too large repulsive intra-pair interactions and it is characterized by a global non-Abelian symmetry group obtained by locking together two independent invariance groups of the corresponding normal state.

Recently, ultra-sensitive noncontact pendulum Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) succeeded in detecting the electronic friction drop caused by the onset of superconductivity in Nb, raising hopes that a wider variety of mechanisms of mechanical dissipation arising from electron organization into different collective phenomena will become accessible through this unconventional surface probe. Among them, the driven phase dynamics of charge-density-waves (CDWs) represents an outstanding challenge as a source of dissipation. Here we report a striking multiplet of AFM dissipation peaks arising at nanometer distances above the surface of NbSeequation - a layered compound exhibiting an incommensurate CDW. Each peak appears at a well defined tip-surface interaction force of the order of a nN, and persists until T=70K where CDW short-range order is known to disappear. A theoretical model is presented showing that the peaks are connected to tip-induced local 2equation CDW phase slips. Under the attractive potential of the approaching tip, the local CDW surface phase landscape deforms continuously until a series of 2equation jumps occur between different values of the local phase. As the tip oscillates to and fro, each slip gives rise to a hysteresis cycle, appearing at a selected distance, the dissipation corresponding to ""pumping"" in and out a local slip in the surface CDW phase of NbSeequation.",16,[],8

We direct the main focus towards the resonant exchange (RX) qubit and the exchange-only qubit, but we also discuss other qubit implementations using three electron spins. For each three-spin qubit we describe the qubit model, the physical realization, the implementations of single-qubit operations, as well as the read-out and initialization schemes. Two-qubit gates and decoherence properties are discussed for the RX qubit and the exchange-only qubit, thereby, completing the list of requirements for a viable candidate qubit implementation for quantum computation. We start with describing the full system of three electrons in a triple quantum dot, then discuss the charge-stability diagram and restrict ourselves to the relevant subsystem, introduce the qubit states, and discuss important transitions to other charge states. Introducing the various qubit implementations, we begin with the exchange-only qubit, followed by the spin-charge qubit, the hybrid qubit, and the RX qubit, discussing for each the single-qubit operations, read-out, and initialization methods, whereas the main focus will be on the RX qubit, whose single-qubit operations are realized by driving the qubit at its resonant frequency in the microwave range similar to electron spin resonance. Two different types of two-qubit operations are presented for the exchange-only and the RX qubit which can be divided into short-ranged and long-ranged interactions. Both of these interaction types can be expected to be necessary in a large-scale quantum computer.

Valley polarization, associated with the occupancy of degenerate, but quantum mechanically distinct valleys in momentum space, closely resembles spin polarization and has been proposed as a pseudospin carrier for the future quantum electronics. Valley exciton polarization has been created in the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers using excitation by circularly polarized light and has been detected both optically and electrically. In addition, the existence of coherence in the valley pseudospin has been identified experimentally. The manipulation of such valley coherence has, however, remained out of reach. Here we demonstrate an all-optical control of the valley coherence by means of the pseudomagnetic field associated with the optical Stark effect. Using below-bandgap circularly polarized light, we experimentally rotate the valley exciton pseudospin in monolayer WSe2 on the femtosecond time scale. Both the direction and speed of the rotation can be optically manipulated by tuning the dynamic phase of excitons in opposite valleys.

In this study, we performed Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to study the hydrogen release mechanism at the typical Al/SiOequation metal-oxide interface. We found that interstitial hydrogen atoms can break interfacial Al-Si bonds, passivating a Si equation orbital. Interstitial hydrogen atoms can also break interfacial Al-O bonds, or be adsorbed at the interface on aluminum, forming stable Al-H-Al bridges. We showed that hydrogenated O-H, Si-H and Al-H bonds at the Al/SiOequation interfaces are polarized. The resulting bond dipole weakens the O-H and Si-H bonds, but strengthens the Al-H bond under the application of a positive bias at the metal gate.

In addition, we observe a narrow resonance near the primary qubit resonance when we operate the device in the (1,1) charge configuration. The experimental data is consistent with a simulation involving two weakly exchanged-coupled spins with a g-factor difference of 1 MHz, of the same order as the Rabi frequency. We conclude that the narrow resonance is the result of driven transitions between the T- and T triplet states, using an ESR signal of frequency located halfway between the resonance frequencies of the two individual spins.

The implications are particularly rich in the boundary case, where delocalization proceeds through different renormalization patterns sharing the feature that the boundary field becomes irrelevant in the delocalized regime.

Interpretations, predictions and simulations of the faceted morphologies remain a challenge, especially for systems in which irrational orientation relationships (ORs) between two phases and irrational interface orientations (IOs) are preferred. In terms of structural singularities, this work suggests an integrated framework, which possibly encompasses all candidates of faceted interfaces. The structural singularities are identified in a matching pattern, a dislocation structure and/or a ledge structure. The resultant singular interfaces are discrete IOs, described with low index g's (rational orientations) and/or Delta-g's (either rational or irrational orientations). Elimination of defects exerts restrictions on the OR and the lattice parameters. Various models are grouped according to their determined results regarding the OR and IO, and the links between the models are clarified in the integrated framework. An irrational IO is usually due to elimination of dislocations in one direction, i.e., an O-line interface. Analytical methods using both 3D and 2D models for quantitative determinations of O-line interfaces are reviewed, and a detailed example showing the calculation for an irrational interface is given.

In this problem, a set of sensors monitor mutually independent dynamical systems in parallel but only one sensor can access the shared channel at each time to transmit the data packet to the estimator. We propose a stochastic event-based sensor scheduling in which each sensor makes transmission decisions based on both channel accessibility and distributed event-triggering conditions. The corresponding minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimator is explicitly given. Considering information patterns accessed by sensor schedulers, time-based ones can be treated as a special case of the proposed one. By ultilizing realtime information, the proposed schedule outperforms the time-based ones in terms of the estimation quality. Resorting to solving an Markov decision process (MDP) problem with average cost criterion, we can find optimal parameters for the proposed schedule. As for practical use, a greedy algorithm is devised for parameter design, which has rather low computational complexity.

1612.03450,cs,"Sparsity-based subspace clustering algorithms have attracted significant attention thanks to their excellent performance in practical applications. A prominent example is the sparse subspace clustering (SSC) algorithm by Elhamifar and Vidal, which performs spectral clustering based on an adjacency matrix obtained by sparsely representing each data point in terms of all the other data points via the Lasso. When the number of data points is large or the dimension of the ambient space is high, the computational complexity of SSC quickly becomes prohibitive. Dyer et al. observed that SSC-OMP obtained by replacing the Lasso by the greedy orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm results in significantly lower computational complexity, while often yielding comparable performance. The central goal of this paper is an analytical performance characterization of SSC-OMP for noisy data. Moreover, we introduce and analyze the SSC-MP algorithm, which employs matching pursuit (MP) in lieu of OMP. Both SSC-OMP and SSC-MP are proven to succeed even when the subspaces intersect and when the data points are contaminated by severe noise. The clustering conditions we obtain for SSC-OMP and SSC-MP are similar to those for SSC and for the thresholding-based subspace clustering (TSC) algorithm due to Heckel and Bolcskei. Analytical results in combination with numerical results indicate that both SSC-OMP and SSC-MP with a data-dependent stopping criterion automatically detect the dimensions of the subspaces underlying the data. Moreover, experiments on synthetic and on real data show that SSC-MP compares very favorably to SSC, SSC-OMP, TSC, and the nearest subspace neighbor algorithm, both in terms of clustering performance and running time. In addition, we find that, in contrast to SSC-OMP, the performance of SSC-MP is very robust with respect to the choice of parameters in the stopping criteria.",16,"['math', 'stat']",7

We report speedups of TTC over a meaningful baseline implementation generated by external C compilers; the results suggest that a domain-specific compiler can outperform its general purpose counterpart significantly: For instance, comparing with Intel's latest C compiler on the Haswell and Knights Corner architecture, TTC yields speedups of up to equation and equation, respectively.

1604.05799,cs,"The range of video annotation software currently available is set within commercially specialized professions, distributed via outdated sources or through online video hosting services. As video content becomes an increasingly significant tool for analysis, there is a demand for appropriate digital annotation techniques that offer equivalent functionality to tools used for annotation of text based literature sources. This paper argues for the importance of video annotating as an effective method for research that is as accessible as literature annotation is. Video annotation has been shown to trigger higher learning and engagement but research struggles to explain the absence of video annotation in contemporary structures of education practice. In both academic and informal settings the use of video playback as a meaningful tool of analysis is apparent, yet the availability of supplementary annotation software is not within obvious grasp or even prevalent in standardized computer software. Practical software tools produced by the researcher have demonstrated effective video annotation in a short development time. With software design programs available for rapid application creation, this paper also highlights the absence of a development community. This paper argues that video annotation is an accessible tool, not just for academic contexts, but also for wider practical video analysis applications, potentially becoming a mainstream learning tool. This paper thus presents a practical multimodal public approach to video research that potentially affords a deeper analysis of media content. This is supported by an in-depth consideration of the motivation for undertaking video annotation and a critical analysis of currently available tools.",16,[],7

This is a common and pervasive problem which deserves more attention. On the basis of Monte Carlo modeling, tables for the expected relative error are given. It seems that it is distributed according to a continuous Poisson distribution over log probabilities. A second essential problem is related to the appropriateness of the Markov assumption. Basic tests will reveal whether a problem requires modeling of the stochastics of seriality, at all. Examples are given of lexical encodings which cover 95-99% classification accuracy of a lexicon, with removed sequence information, for several European languages.

It is robust with respect to the mesh size and the ansatz order, at least up to equation.

1605.03124,cs,"For applications such as airport border control, biometric technologies that can process many capture subjects quickly, efficiently, with weak supervision, and with minimal discomfort are desirable. Facial recognition is particularly appealing because it is minimally invasive yet offers relatively good recognition performance. Unfortunately, the combination of weak supervision and minimal invasiveness makes even highly accurate facial recognition systems susceptible to spoofing via presentation attacks. Thus, there is great demand for an effective and low cost system capable of rejecting such attacks.To this end we introduce PARAPH -- a novel hardware extension that exploits different measurements of light polarization to yield an image space in which presentation media are readily discernible from Bona Fide facial characteristics. The PARAPH system is inexpensive with an added cost of less than 10 US dollars. The system makes two polarization measurements in rapid succession, allowing them to be approximately pixel-aligned, with a frame rate limited by the camera, not the system. There are no moving parts above the molecular level, due to the efficient use of twisted nematic liquid crystals. We present evaluation images using three presentation attack media next to an actual face -- high quality photos on glossy and matte paper and a video of the face on an LCD. In each case, the actual face in the image generated by PARAPH is structurally discernible from the presentations, which appear either as noise (print attacks) or saturated images (replay attacks).",16,[],7

Such epidemics are described by equation- or equation-state Markov chains. Ostensibly, because analyzing such Markov chains is too complicated, their equation-dimensional nonlinear ""mean-field"" approximation, and its linearization, are often studied instead. We provide a complete global analysis of the epidemic dynamics of the nonlinear mean-field approximation. In particular, we show that depending on the largest eigenvalue of the underlying graph adjacency matrix and the rates of infection, recovery, and vaccination, the global dynamics takes on one of two forms: either the epidemic dies out, or it converges to another unique fixed point (the so-called endemic state where a constant fraction of the nodes remain infected). A similar result has also been shown in the continuous-time case. We tie in these results with the ""true"" underlying Markov chain model by showing that the linear model is the tightest upper-bound on the true probabilities of infection that involves only marginals, and that, even though the nonlinear model is not an upper-bound on the true probabilities in general, it does provide an upper-bound on the probability of the chain not being absorbed. As a consequence, we also show that when the disease-free fixed point is globally stable for the mean-field model, the Markov chain has an equation mixing time, which means the epidemic dies out quickly. We compare and summarize the results on different propagation models.",16,['math'],7
1607.04984,cs,"Graph clustering is a fundamental computational problem with a number of applications in algorithm design, machine learning, data mining, and analysis of social networks. Over the past decades, researchers have proposed a number of algorithmic design methods for graph clustering. However, most of these methods are based on complicated spectral techniques or convex optimisation, and cannot be applied directly for clustering many networks that occur in practice, whose information is often collected on different sites. Designing a simple and distributed clustering algorithm is of great interest, and has wide applications for processing big datasets. In this paper we present a simple and distributed algorithm for graph clustering: for a wide class of graphs that are characterised by a strong cluster-structure, our algorithm finishes in a poly-logarithmic number of rounds, and recovers a partition of the graph close to an optimal partition. The main component of our algorithm is an application of the random matching model of load balancing, which is a fundamental protocol in distributed computing and has been extensively studied in the past 20 years. Hence, our result highlights an intrinsic and interesting connection between graph clustering and load balancing. At a technical level, we present a purely algebraic result characterising the early behaviours of load balancing processes for graphs exhibiting a cluster-structure. We believe that this result can be further applied to analyse other gossip processes, such as rumour spreading and averaging processes.",16,[],7
1612.01855,cs,"We present a new parallel algorithm for solving triangular systems with multiple right hand sides (TRSM). TRSM is used extensively in numerical linear algebra computations, both to solve triangular linear systems of equations as well as to compute factorizations with triangular matrices, such as Cholesky, LU, and QR. Our algorithm achieves better theoretical scalability than known alternatives, while maintaining numerical stability, via selective use of triangular matrix inversion. We leverage the fact that triangular inversion and matrix multiplication are more parallelizable than the standard TRSM algorithm. By only inverting triangular blocks along the diagonal of the initial matrix, we generalize the usual way of TRSM computation and the full matrix inversion approach. This flexibility leads to an efficient algorithm for any ratio of the number of right hand sides to the triangular matrix dimension. We provide a detailed communication cost analysis for our algorithm as well as for the recursive triangular matrix inversion. This cost analysis makes it possible to determine optimal block sizes and processor grids a priori.

In particular, for any jointly stationary process (a) one reliably learns the covariance structure from as little as a single realization of the process, and (b) solves MMSE recovery problems, such as interpolation and denoising, in computational time nearly linear on the number of edges and timesteps.

A natural question to ask, then is: How does a correctness condition for a concurrent object ensure correctness of a client program that uses the concurrent object? This paper presents the main issues that surround this question and provides some answers by linking different correctness conditions with a form of trace refinement.",16,[],7
1607.06186,cs,"Fuzzy Rule-Based Classification Systems (FRBCSs) have the potential to provide so-called interpretable classifiers, i.e. classifiers which can be introspective, understood, validated and augmented by human experts by relying on fuzzy-set based rules. This paper builds on prior work for interval type-2 fuzzy set based FRBCs where the fuzzy sets and rules of the classifier are generated using an initial clustering stage. By introducing Subtractive Clustering in order to identify multiple cluster prototypes, the proposed approach has the potential to deliver improved classification performance while maintaining good interpretability, i.e. without resulting in an excessive number of rules. The paper provides a detailed overview of the proposed FRBC framework, followed by a series of exploratory experiments on both linearly and non-linearly separable datasets, comparing results to existing rule-based and SVM approaches. Overall, initial results indicate that the approach enables comparable classification performance to non rule-based classifiers such as SVM, while often achieving this with a very small number of rules.",16,[],7

More recently, there is a marriage of CRF and recurrent neural models, so that we can gain from both non-linear dense features and globally normalized CRF objective. These recurrent neural CRF models mainly focus on encode node features in CRF undirected graphs. However, edge features prove important to CRF in structured prediction. In this work, we introduce a new recurrent neural CRF model, which learns non-linear edge features, and thus makes non-linear features encoded completely. We compare our model with different neural models in well-known structured prediction tasks.

Furthermore, the vehicular handoff rate and the vehicular overhead ratio have been proposed to evaluate the vehicular mobility performance in 5G cooperative small cell networks.

1607.01482,cs,"This paper deals with continuous-time opinion dynamics that feature the interplay of continuous opinions and discrete behaviours. In our model, the opinion of one individual is only influenced by the behaviours of fellow individuals. The key technical difficulty in the study of these dynamics is that the right-hand sides of the equations are discontinuous and thus their solutions must be intended in some generalized sense: in our analysis, we consider both Carath\'eodory and Krasowskii solutions. We first prove existence and completeness of Carath\'eodory solutions from every initial condition and we highlight a pathological behaviour of Carath\'eodory solutions, which can converge to points that are not (Carath\'eodory) equilibria. Notably, such points can be arbitrarily far from consensus and indeed simulations show that convergence to non-consensus configurations is very common. In order to cope with these pathological attractors, we then study Krasowskii solutions. We give an estimate of the asymptotic distance of all Krasowskii solutions from consensus and we prove its tightness via an example: this estimate is quadratic in the number of agents, implying that quantization can drastically destroy consensus. However, we are able to prove convergence to consensus in some special cases, namely when the communication among the individuals is described by either a complete or a complete bipartite graph.",16,['math'],7
1604.03211,cs,"There are billions of lines of sequential code inside nowadays' software which do not benefit from the parallelism available in modern multicore architectures. Automatically parallelizing sequential code, to promote an efficient use of the available parallelism, has been a research goal for some time now. This work proposes a new approach for achieving such goal. We created a new parallelizing compiler that analyses the read and write instructions, and control-flow modifications in programs to identify a set of dependencies between the instructions in the program. Afterwards, the compiler, based on the generated dependencies graph, rewrites and organizes the program in a task-oriented structure. Parallel tasks are composed by instructions that cannot be executed in parallel. A work-stealing-based parallel runtime is responsible for scheduling and managing the granularity of the generated tasks. Furthermore, a compile-time granularity control mechanism also avoids creating unnecessary data-structures. This work focuses on the Java language, but the techniques are general enough to be applied to other programming languages. We have evaluated our approach on 8 benchmark programs against OoOJava, achieving higher speedups. In some cases, values were close to those of a manual parallelization. The resulting parallel code also has the advantage of being readable and easily configured to improve further its performance manually.",16,[],7

Through the attention mechanism, we find that headedness plays a central role in phrasal representation (with the model's latent attention largely agreeing with predictions made by hand-crafted head rules, albeit with some important differences).

Such fine-grained annotations not only help understand what have impeded previous efforts on learning to fuse the multi-modal features, but also enhance the generalization ability of the learned fusion to novel test data. The new subclass based solution, with AP of 0.303 and P100 of 0.55 on the MediaEval 2015 test set, outperforms several state-of-the-art alternatives. Notice that our solution does not require fine-grained annotations on the test set, so it can be directly applied on novel and fully unlabeled videos.

The goal is to gain new insights due to the inclusion of MIMO (multiple antennas at both transmitters and receivers) into the signal space partitioning schemes associated with partial CSIT. An interesting idea that emerges from this study is ""elevated multiplexing"" where the signals are split into streams and transmitted from separate antennas at elevated power levels, which allows these signals to be jointly decoded at one receiver which has fewer spatial dimensions with lower interference floors, while another receiver is simultaneously able to separately decode these signals with a higher interference floor but across a greater number of spatial dimensions. Remarkably, we find that there is a DoF benefit from increasing the number of antennas at a transmitter even if that transmitter already has more antennas than its desired receiver and has no CSIT.",16,['math'],7

1604.07201,cs,"The template-based method is one of the most successful approaches to algebraic invariant synthesis. In this method, an algorithm designates a template polynomial p over program variables, generates constraints for p=0 to be an invariant, and solves the generated constraints. However, this approach often suffers from an increasing template size if the degree of a template polynomial is too high.   We propose a technique to make template-based methods more efficient. Our technique is based on the following finding: If an algebraic invariant exists, then there is a specific algebraic invariant that we call a generalized homogeneous algebraic invariant that is often smaller. This finding justifies using only a smaller template that corresponds to a generalized homogeneous algebraic invariant.   Concretely, we state our finding above formally based on the abstract semantics of an imperative program proposed by Cachera et al. Then, we modify their template-based invariant synthesis so that it generates only generalized homogeneous algebraic invariants. This modification is proved to be sound. Furthermore, we also empirically demonstrate the merit of the restriction to generalized homogeneous algebraic invariants. Our implementation outperforms that of Cachera et al. for programs that require a higher-degree template.",16,[],7

1608.02195,cs,Every day media generate large amounts of text. An unbiased view on media reports requires an understanding of the political bias of media content. Assistive technology for estimating the political bias of texts can be helpful in this context. This study proposes a simple statistical learning approach to predict political bias from text. Standard text features extracted from speeches and manifestos of political parties are used to predict political bias in terms of political party affiliation and in terms of political views. Results indicate that political bias can be predicted with above chance accuracy. Mistakes of the model can be interpreted with respect to changes of policies of political actors. Two approaches are presented to make the results more interpretable: a) discriminative text features are related to the political orientation of a party and b) sentiment features of texts are correlated with a measure of political power. Political power appears to be strongly correlated with positive sentiment of a text. To highlight some potential use cases a web application shows how the model can be used for texts for which the political bias is not clear such as news articles.,16,[],7

We address the repair problem when a device storing data leaves the cell. We introduce a repair scheduling where repair is performed periodically and derive analytical expressions for the overall communication cost of content download and data repair as a function of the repair interval. The derived expressions are then used to evaluate the communication cost entailed by DS using several erasure correcting codes. Our results show that DS can reduce the communication cost with respect to the case where content is downloaded only from the BS, provided that repairs are performed frequently enough. If devices storing content arrive to the cell, the communication cost using DS is further reduced and, for large enough arrival rate, it is always beneficial.

1609.06825,cs,"We study the algorithmics of information structure design -- a.k.a. persuasion or signaling -- in a fundamental special case introduced by Arieli and Babichenko: multiple agents, binary actions, and no inter-agent externalities. Unlike prior work on this model, we allow many states of nature. We assume that the principal's objective is a monotone set function, and study the problem both in the public signal and private signal models, drawing a sharp contrast between the two in terms of both efficacy and computational complexity.   When private signals are allowed, our results are largely positive and quite general. First, we show polynomial-time equivalence between optimal signaling and the problem of maximizing the objective function plus an additive function. This yields an efficient implementation of the optimal scheme when the objective is supermodular or anonymous. Second, we exhibit a (1-1/e)-approximation of the optimal private signaling scheme, modulo an additive loss of equation, when the objective function is submodular. These two results simplify, unify, and generalize results of [Arieli and Babichenko, 2016] and [Babichenko and Barman, 2016], extending them from a binary state of nature to many states (modulo the additive loss in the latter result). Third, we consider the binary-state case with a submodular objective, and simplify and slightly strengthen the result of [Babichenko and Barman, 2016] to obtain a (1-1/e)-approximation via an explicitly constructed scheme.   When only a public signal is allowed, our results are negative. First, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate the optimal public scheme, within any constant factor, even when the objective is additive.

1603.01508,cs,"The correlations and network structure amongst individuals in datasets today---whether explicitly articulated, or deduced from biological or behavioral connections---pose new issues around privacy guarantees, because of inferences that can be made about one individual from another's data. This motivates quantifying privacy in networked contexts in terms of ""inferential privacy""---which measures the change in beliefs about an individual's data from the result of a computation---as originally proposed by Dalenius in the 1970's. Inferential privacy is implied by differential privacy when data are independent, but can be much worse when data are correlated; indeed, simple examples, as well as a general impossibility theorem of Dwork and Naor, preclude the possibility of achieving non-trivial inferential privacy when the adversary can have arbitrary auxiliary information. In this paper, we ask how differential privacy guarantees translate to guarantees on inferential privacy in networked contexts: specifically, under what limitations on the adversary's information about correlations, modeled as a prior distribution over datasets, can we deduce an inferential guarantee from a differential one?   We prove two main results. The first result pertains to distributions that satisfy a natural positive-affiliation condition, and gives an upper bound on the inferential privacy guarantee for any differentially private mechanism. This upper bound is matched by a simple mechanism that adds Laplace noise to the sum of the data. The second result pertains to distributions that have weak correlations, defined in terms of a suitable ""influence matrix"". The result provides an upper bound for inferential privacy in terms of the differential privacy parameter and the spectral norm of this matrix.",16,[],7

Thus we go beyond the usually considered construction for free models.   More precisely, considering such interactions in a weak regime, we find solutions for which the expectation value of the number operator N is finite, as in the free case. When tuning the interaction to the strongly nonlinear regime, however, we obtain solutions for which N grows and eventually blows up, which is reminiscent of what one observes for real Bose-Einstein condensates, where a strong interaction regime can only be realized at high density. This behaviour suggests the breakdown of the Bogoliubov ansatz for quantum gravity condensates and the need for non-Fock representations to describe the system when the condensate constituents are strongly correlated.   Furthermore, we study the expectation values of certain geometric operators imported from Loop Quantum Gravity in the free and interacting cases. In particular, computing solutions around the nontrivial minima of the interaction potentials, one finds, already in the weakly interacting case, a nonvanishing condensate population for which the spectra are dominated by the lowest nontrivial configuration of the quantum geometry. This result indicates that the condensate may indeed consist of many smallest building blocks giving rise to an effectively continuous geometry, thus suggesting the interpretation of the condensate phase to correspond to a geometric phase.",16,[],13

The gravitational instability of the Levi - Civita metric was recently established, and the purpose of this paper is to investigate what changes result from the introduction of a cosmological constant. A fundamental difference brought about by a (negative) cosmological constant is in the structure at infinity. This introduces an added problem in attempting to define an evolution for the perturbations because the constant time hypersurfaces are not Cauchy surfaces. In this paper we show that under a large set of boundary conditions that lead to a unique evolution of the perturbations, we always find unstable modes, that would generically be present in the evolution of arbitrary initial data, leading to the conclusion that the Linet - Tian space times with negative cosmological constant are linearly unstable under gravitational perturbations.",16,[],13
1605.08757,gr-qc,"Many theories of modified gravity with higher order derivatives are usually ignored because of serious problems that appear due to an additional ghost degree of freedom. Most dangerously, it causes an immediate decay of the vacuum. However, breaking Lorentz invariance can cure such abominable behavior. By analyzing a model that describes a massive graviton together with a remaining Boulware-Deser ghost mode we show that even ghostly theories of modified gravity can yield models that are viable at both classical and quantum levels and, therefore, they should not generally be ruled out. Furthermore, we identify the most dangerous quantum scattering process that has the main impact on the decay time and find differences to simple theories that only describe an ordinary scalar field and a ghost. Additionally, constraints on the parameters of the theory including some upper bounds on the Lorentz-breaking cutoff scale are presented. In particular, for a simple theory of massive gravity we find that a breaking of Lorentz invariance is allowed to happen even at scales above the Planck mass.

1607.03593,gr-qc,"The moment of inertia, the spin-induced quadrupole moment, and the tidal Love number of neutron-star and quark-star models are related through some relations which depend only mildly on the stellar equation of state. These ""I-Love-Q"" relations have important implications for astrophysics and gravitational-wave astronomy. An interesting problem is whether similar relations hold for other compact objects and how they approach the black-hole limit. To answer these questions, here we investigate the deformation properties of a large class of thin-shell gravastars, which are exotic compact objects that do not possess an event horizon nor a spacetime singularity. Working in a small-spin and small-tidal field expansion, we calculate the moment of inertia, the quadrupole moment, and the (quadrupolar electric) tidal Love number of gravastars with a polytropic thin shell. The I-Love-Q relations of a thin-shell gravastar are drastically different from those of an ordinary neutron star. The Love number and quadrupole moment are negative for less compact models and the I-Love-Q relations continuously approach the black-hole limit. We consider a variety of polytropic equations of state for the matter shell, and find no universality in the I-Love-Q relations. However, we cannot deny the possibility that, similarly to the neutron-star case, an approximate universality might emerge for a limited class of equations of state. Finally, we discuss how a measurement of the tidal deformability from the gravitational-wave detection of a compact-binary inspiral can be used to constrain exotic compact objects like gravastars.",16,['astro-ph'],13

The essential difference between the usual differential geometry and SDG is that the latter enriches the real line by introducing infinitesimal of various kinds. Owing to this geometry acquires a tool to penetrate ""infinitesimally small"" parts of a given manifold. However, to make use of this tool we must switch from the category of sets to some other suitable category. We try two topoi: the topos equation of germ determined ideals and the so-called Basel topos equation. The category of manifolds is a subcategory of both of them. In equation, we construct a simple model of a contracting sphere. As the sphere shrinks, its curvature increases, but when the radius of the sphere reaches infinitesimal values, the curvature becomes infinitesimal and the singularity is avoided. The topos equation, unlike the topos equation, has invertible infinitesimal and infinitely large nonstandard natural numbers. This allows us to see what happens when a function ""goes through a singularity"".

1603.02676,gr-qc,"Alternative theories of gravity and their solutions are of considerable importance since at some fundamental level the world can reveal new features. Indeed, it is suspected that the gravitational field might be nonminimally coupled to the other fields at scales not yet probed, bringing into the forefront nonminimally coupled theories. In this mode, we consider a nonminimal Einstein-Yang-Mills theory with a cosmological constant. Imposing spherical symmetry and staticity for the spacetime and a magnetic Wu-Yang ansatz for the Yang-Mills field, we find expressions for the solutions of the theory. Further imposing constraints on the nonminimal parameters, we find a family of exact solutions of the theory depending on five parameters, namely, two nonminimal parameters, the cosmological constant, the magnetic charge, and the mass. These solutions represent magnetic monopoles and black holes in magnetic monopoles with de Sitter, Minkowskian, and anti-de Sitter asymptotics, depending on the sign and value of the cosmological constant equation. We classify completely the family of solutions with respect to the number and the type of horizons and show that the spacetime solutions can have, at most, four horizons. For particular sets of the parameters, these horizons can become double, triple, and quadruple. For instance, for a positive cosmological constant equation, there is a critical equation for which the solution admits a quadruple horizon, evocative of the equation that appears for a given energy density in both the Einstein static and Eddington-Lema\\itre dynamical universes. As an example of our classification, we analyze solutions in the Drummond-Hathrell nonminimal theory that describe nonminimal black holes.

Compact binaries remain the primary target sources for LIGO, of which neutron star-black hole (NSBH) binaries form an important subset. GWs from NSBH sources carry signatures of (a) the tidal distortion of the neutron star by its companion black hole during inspiral, and (b) its potential tidal disruption near merger. In this paper, we present a Bayesian study of the measurability of neutron star tidal deformability equation using observation(s) of inspiral-merger GW signals from disruptive NSBH coalescences, taking into account the crucial effect of black hole spins. First, we find that if non-tidal templates are used to estimate source parameters for an NSBH signal, the bias introduced in the estimation of non-tidal physical parameters will only be significant for loud signals with signal-to-noise ratios equation. For similarly loud signals, we also find that we can begin to put interesting constraints on equation (factor of 1-2) with individual observations. Next, we study how a population of realistic NSBH detections will improve our measurement of neutron star tidal deformability. For astrophysical populations of equation NSBH mergers, we find 20-35 events to be sufficient to constrain equation within equation, depending on the chosen equation of state. In this we also assume that LIGO will detect black holes with masses within the astrophysical equation-equation. If the mass-gap remains preserved in NSBHs detected by LIGO, we estimate that equation equation detections will furnish comparable tidal measurement accuracy.

Efforts to understand this relationship face the problem of the enormous computational complexity involved in evolving a generic state containing many quanta. In a cosmological context however, certain symmetry assumptions on the quantum states allow to simplify the problem. In this paper, we will show how quantum states describing a spatially flat homogeneous and isotropic universe can be refined and coarse grained. Invariance of the dynamics of the coarse observables is shown to require a certain scaling property (familiar from loop quantum cosmology) of the quantum states if no running of parameters is taken into account. The involved states are solutions to the Hamiltonian constraint when terms coming from spatial derivatives are neglected, i.e. one works in the approximation of non-interacting FRW patches.

1609.08949,gr-qc,"A long-standing problem in numerical relativity is the satisfactory treatment of future null-infinity. We propose an approach for the evolution of hyperboloidal initial data in which the outer boundary of the computational domain is placed at infinity. The main idea is to apply the `dual foliation' formalism in combination with hyperboloidal coordinates and the generalized harmonic gauge formulation. The strength of the present approach is that, following the ideas of Zenginoglu, a hyperboloidal layer can be naturally attached to a central region using standard coordinates of numerical relativity applications. Employing a generalization of the standard hyperboloidal slices, developed by Calabrese et. al., we find that all formally singular terms take a trivial limit as we head to null-infinity. A byproduct is a numerical approach for hyperboloidal evolution of nonlinear wave equations violating the null-condition. The height-function method, used often for fixed background spacetimes, is generalized in such a way that the slices can be dynamically `waggled' to maintain the desired outgoing coordinate lightspeed precisely. This is achieved by dynamically solving the eikonal equation. As a first numerical test of the new approach we solve the 3D flat space scalar wave equation.

In the context of relativistic Lagrangian mechanics, causal times corresponds to admissible parameterizations of paths, and we show that in order for a langragian to not depend on any particular causal time (as its values have no intrinsic meaning), it has to be homogeneous in its velocity argument. We illustrate this property with the example of a free particle in a potential. Then, using a geometric Lagrangian (i.e. a parameterization independent Lagrangian which is also manifestly covariant), we introduce the notion of ageodesicity of a path which measures to what extent a path is far from being a geodesic, and show how the notion can be used in the twin paradox to differentiate the paths followed by the two twins.",16,"['math-ph', 'math', 'physics']",13
1601.07475,gr-qc,"We study the effect of a mass term in the spontaneous scalarization of neutron stars, for a wide range of scalar field parameters and neutron star equations of state. Even though massless scalars have been the focus of interest in spontaneous scalarization so far, recent observations of binary systems rule out most of their interesting parameter space. We point out that adding a mass term to the scalar field potential is a natural extension to the model that avoids these observational bounds if the Compton wavelength of the scalar is small compared to the binary separation. Our model is formally similar to the asymmetron scenario recently introduced in application to cosmology, though here we are interested in consequences for neutron stars and thus consider a mass term that does not modify the geometry on cosmological scales. We review the allowed values for the mass and scalarization parameters in the theory given current binary system observations and black hole spin measurements. We show that within the allowed ranges, spontaneous scalarization can have nonperturbative, strong effects that may lead to observable signatures in binary neutron star or black hole-neutron star mergers, or even in isolated neutron stars.",16,[],13

For the slow MHD mode, on the other hand, the wave is governed by the advective-type equation without an isotropic dispersion term. Thus, the ""distance"" perpendicular to the wave propagation is not defined and the magnetoacoustic metric cannot be introduced. To investigate the properties of the magnetoacoustic geometry for the fast mode, we prepare a two-dimensional axisymmetric inflow and examine the behavior of magnetoacoustic rays which is a counterpart of the MHD waves in the eikonal limit. We find that the magnetoacoustic geometry is classified into three types depending on two parameters characterizing the background flow:~analog spacetimes of rotating black holes, ultra spinning stars with ergoregions, and spinning stars without ergoregions.

In this scenario, the isotropy of expansion is guaranteed considering a triplet of orthogonal vector fields, but the effective mass of the vector field is of the order of the Hubble scale and the inflationary regime is difficult to realize with this model. However, for suitable values (or constraints) of model parameters, it is possible to overcome this issue. In this sense, two cases were analyzed.

1601.06436,gr-qc,"Over the last two decades, many unexpected relations between exotic smoothness, e.g. exotic equation, and quantum field theory were found. Some of these relations are rooted in a relation to superstring theory and quantum gravity. Therefore one would expect that exotic smoothness is directly related to the quantization of general relativity. In this article we will support this conjecture and develop a new approach to quantum gravity called \emphsmooth quantum gravity by using smooth 4-manifolds with an exotic smoothness structure. In particular we discuss the appearance of a wildly embedded 3-manifold which we identify with a quantum state. Furthermore, we analyze this quantum state by using foliation theory and relate it to an element in an operator algebra. Then we describe a set of geometric, non-commutative operators, the skein algebra, which can be used to determine the geometry of a 3-manifold. This operator algebra can be understood as a deformation quantization of the classical Poisson algebra of observables given by holonomies. The structure of this operator algebra induces an action by using the quantized calculus of Connes. The scaling behavior of this action is analyzed to obtain the classical theory of General Relativity (GRT) for large scales. This approach has some obvious properties: there are non-linear gravitons, a connection to lattice gauge field theory and a dimensional reduction from 4D to 2D. Some cosmological consequences like the appearance of an inflationary phase are also discussed. At the end we will get the simple picture that the change from the standard equation to the exotic equation is a quantization of geometry.",16,"['hep-th', 'math-ph', 'math']",13

First, up to thousands of BHB will be individually resolvable by eLISA; second, millions of non resolvable BHBs will build a confusion noise detectable with signal-to-noise ratio of few to hundreds; third -- and perhaps most importantly -- up to hundreds of BHBs individually resolvable by eLISA will coalesce in the aLIGO band within ten years. eLISA observations will tell aLIGO and all electromagnetic probes weeks in advance when and where these BHB coalescences are going to occur, with uncertainties of <10s and <1deg2.

The usual argument offered in literature is that the present density of the universe is very close to the critical density value and that the universe must be flat since otherwise in past at equation second (near the epoch of inflation) there will be extremely low departures of density from the critical density value, of the order equation), requiring a sort of fine tuning. We show that even if the present value of the density parameter were very different, still at equation second it would differ from unity by a similar fraction. Thus a use of fine tuning argument to promote equation model amounts to \em a priori rejection of all models with equation.

The data were taken at equation beam energy and the results are shown for the kinematic range equation in photon virtuality, equation in the Bjorken scaling variable and equation in the mass of the hadronic final state. The deuteron double-spin asymmetry equation and the deuteron longitudinal-spin structure function equation are presented in bins of equation and equation. Towards lowest accessible values of equation, equation decreases and becomes consistent with zero within uncertainties. The presented final equation values together with the recently published final equation values of COMPASS are used to again evaluate the Bjorken sum rule and perform the QCD fit to the equation world data at next-to-leading order of the strong coupling constant. In both cases, changes in central values of the resulting numbers are well within statistical uncertainties. The flavour-singlet axial charge equation, which is identified in the equation renormalisation scheme with the total contribution of quark helicities to the nucleon spin, is extracted from only the COMPASS deuteron data with negligible extrapolation uncertainty: equation.

1606.06817,hep-ex,"Many high-energy physics analyses require the presence of leptons from equation, equation, or equation boson decay. For these analyses, signatures that mimic such leptons present a `fake lepton' background that must be estimated. Since the magnitude of this background depends strongly upon details of the detector response, it can be difficult to estimate with simulation. One data-driven approach is the `matrix method', in which two categories of leptons are defined (`loose' and `tight'), with the tight category being a subset of the loose category. Using the populations of leptons in each category in the analysis sample, and the efficiencies for both real and fake leptons in the loose category to satisfy the criteria for the tight category, the fake background yield can be estimated. This paper describes a Poisson likelihood implementation of the matrix method, which provides a more precise, reliable, and robust estimate of the fake background yield compared to an analytic solution. This implementation also provides a reliable estimate of the background for cases in which the analysis selection permits more loose leptons than tight leptons, potentially allowing for greater selection efficiency.",16,[],12

The Tevatron experiments presented combined results showing evidence for the equation process at a significance level of about 3 standard deviations, while the combined LHC results from Run-1 data show a 2.6 standard deviation evidence for the equation decay mode.

In a gluino pair production model with baryon number violation, gluinos with a mass less than 0.98 and 1.03 TeV are excluded, by analyses in a fully hadronic and one-lepton final state, respectively. An analysis in a dilepton final state is used to exclude bottom squarks with masses less than 307 GeV in a model considering bottom squark pair production. Multilepton final states are considered in the context of either strong or electroweak production of superpartners, and are used to set limits on the masses of the lightest supersymmetric particles.

This happens if these channels are coupled through final state interactions (FSI). In the specific process equation, involving one pseudo-scalar and one vector particle in the final state, we argue that the CP asymmetry, inherent from a short distance mechanism, could be suppressed due to the CPT constraint. In this case, we propose a sensitive and practical experimental method to identify even a small CP asymmetry, which provides the values for equation without the need for an amplitude analysis. This method, if applied directly to data, will enable to extract the CP asymmetry information in a model independent way and check to which extend the suggested suppression due to the CPT constraint is verified.",16,['hep-ex'],2

1602.00684,hep-ph,"We study the CP violation in the Higgs boson and toponia production process at the ILC where the toponia are produced near the threshold. With the approximation that the production vertex of the Higgs boson and toponia is contact, and neglecting the P-wave toponia, we analytically calculated the density matrix for the production and decay of the toponia. Under these assumptions, the production spectrum of the toponia is solely determined by the spin quantum number, therefore the toponia can be either singlet or triplet. We find that the production rate of the singlet toponium is highly suppressed, and behaves just like the production of a P-wave toponia. In the case of the triplet toponium, three completely independent CP observables, namely azimuthal angles of lepton and anti-lepton in the toponium rest-frame as well as their sum, are predicted based on our analytical results, and checked by using the tree-level event generator. The non-trivial correlations come from the longitudinal-transverse interferences for the azimuthal angles of leptons, and the transverse-transverse interference for their sum. These three observables are well defined at the ILC, where the rest frame of the toponium can be reconstructed directly. Furthermore, the QCD-strong corrections, which are important near the threshold region, are also studied with the approximation of spin-independent QCD-Coulomb potential. While the total cross section is enhanced, the spin correlations predicted in this paper are not affected.",16,['hep-ex'],2

1608.07578,hep-ph,"We propose a new alternative to the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) paradigm for dark matter. Rather than being determined by thermal freeze-out, the dark matter abundance in this scenario is set by dark matter decay, which is allowed for a limited amount of time just before the electroweak phase transition. More specifically, we consider fermionic singlet dark matter particles coupled weakly to a scalar mediator equation and to auxiliary dark sector fields, charged under the Standard Model gauge groups. Dark matter freezes out while still relativistic, so its abundance is initially very large. As the Universe cools down, the scalar mediator develops a vacuum expectation value (vev), which breaks the symmetry that stabilises dark matter. This allows dark matter to mix with charged fermions and decay. During this epoch, the dark matter abundance is reduced to give the value observed today. Later, the SM Higgs field also develops a vev, which feeds back into the equation potential and restores the dark sector symmetry. In a concrete model we show that this ""vev flip-flop"" scenario is phenomenologically successful in the most interesting regions of its parameter space. We also comment on detection prospects at the LHC and elsewhere.",16,[],2

We investigate the production of charmed tetraquarks equation in equation and equation decays. Whether the states with three light quarks belong to equation or equation can be determined by studying various tetraquark equation and equation decays.

For a nonminimal coupling parameter equation, decays through the gravity portal are consistent with observations if the dark matter mass is smaller than equation GeV, for the scalar doublet, and equation GeV, for the fermionic singlet.",16,['astro-ph'],2
1612.07377,hep-ph,"When neutrino masses arise from the exchange of neutral heavy leptons, as in most seesaw schemes, the effective lepton mixing matrix equation describing neutrino propagation is non-unitary, hence neutrinos are not exactly orthonormal. New CP violation phases appear in equation that could be confused with the standard phase equation characterizing the three neutrino paradigm. We study the potential of the long-baseline neutrino experiment DUNE in probing CP violation induced by the standard CP phase in the presence of non-unitarity. In order to accomplish this we develop our previous formalism, so as to take into account the neutrino interactions with the medium, important in long baseline experiments such as DUNE. We find that the expected CP sensitivity of DUNE is somewhat degraded with respect to that characterizing the standard unitary case. However the effect is weaker than might have been expected thanks mainly to the wide neutrino beam. We also investigate the sensitivity of DUNE to the parameters characterizing non-unitarity. In this case we find that there is no improvement expected with respect to the current situation, unless the near detector setup is revamped.",16,['hep-ex'],2
1601.02953,hep-ph,"One of the methods to calculate tree-level multi-gluon scattering amplitudes is to use the Berends-Giele recursion relation involving off-shell currents or off-shell amplitudes, if working in the light cone gauge. As shown in recent works using the light-front perturbation theory, solutions to these recursions naturally collapse into gauge invariant and gauge-dependent components, at least for some helicity configurations. In this work, we show that such structure is helicity independent and emerges from analytic properties of matrix elements of Wilson line operators, where the slope of the straight gauge path is shifted in a certain complex direction. This is similar to the procedure leading to the Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten (BCFW) recursion, however we apply a complex shift to the Wilson line slope instead of the external momenta. While in the original BCFW procedure the boundary integrals over the complex shift vanish for certain deformations, here they are non-zero and are equal to the off-shell amplitudes. The main result can thus be summarized as follows: we derive a decomposition of a helicity-fixed off-shell current into gauge invariant component given by a matrix element of a straight Wilson line plus a reminder given by a sum of products of gauge invariant and gauge dependent quantities. We give several examples realizing this relation, including the five-point next-to-MHV helicity configuration.",16,['hep-th'],2

Following the idea that the fine-tuning can measure effects of some missing mechanism, we impose non-universal gaugino masses at the GUT scalem and explore the low scale implications. We realize that the fine-tuning parametrized with DeltaEW can be as low as zero. We consider the stop mass with a special importance and focus on the mass scales as mstop <=700 GeV, which are excluded by current experiments when the stop decays into a neutralino along with a top quark or a chargino along with a b quark. We find that the stop mass can be as low as about 200 GeV with DeltaEW ~ 50. We find that the solutions in this region can be exluded only up to 60% when stop decays into a neutralino-top quark, and 50% when it decays into a chargino-b quark pair. Setting 65% CL to be potential exclusion and 95% to be pure exclusion limit such solutions will be tested in near future experiments, which are conducted with higher luminosity. In addition to stop, the region with low fine-tuning and light stops predicts masses for the other supersymmetric particles such as msbottom >~ 600 GeV, mstau >~ 1 TeV, mchargino >~ 120 GeV.

These parameters are in turn determined by the geometrical configuration of the warped compactification. We explore the possibility that the 750 GeV excess recently seen in 13 TeV data at ATLAS and CMS could be such a warped Kaluza-Klein graviton, and find a best-fit value equation TeV.

Although current data are not informative enough to strongly constrain the theory parameter space, we demonstrate the power of our formalism to reconstruct the theoretical parameters compatible with an actual dark matter detection, by assuming that the excess of gamma rays observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope towards the Galactic centre is entirely due to dark matter annihilations. Please note that the excess can very well be due to astrophysical sources such as millisecond pulsars.

We construct them perturbatively in a double expansion in the distance and strength of the conical singularity, and extract the vacuum polarisation due to the cone. Recent results about the structure of logarithmic divergences of Renyi entropies are reproduced ---in particular, equation.

The decoherence rate is computed in the one-loop form from functional integration. For heavy fields with equation, quantum fluctuations will easily stay in the quantum state and decoherence is unlikely.

We focus first on the spin-3 case and then extend some of our main results to spin-equation, many of which resemble the spin-2 results: the generators of the asymptotic equation algebra naturally emerge from composite operators of the equation charges through a twisted Sugawara construction; our boundary conditions ensure regularity of the Euclidean solutions space independently of the values of the charges; solutions, which we call ""higher spin black flowers"", are stationary but not necessarily spherically symmetric. Finally, we derive the entropy of higher spin black flowers, and find that for the branch that is continuously connected to the BTZ black hole, it depends only on the affine purely gravitational zero modes.

For other solutions the equation-term and matter are screened at all times but there are nevertheless the early and late accelerating phases. The model also admits bounces, as well as peculiar solutions describing ""the emergence of time"". Most of these solutions contain ghosts in the scalar and tensor sectors. However, a careful analysis reveals three different branches of ghost-free solutions, all showing a late time acceleration phase. We analyze the dynamical stability of these solutions and find that all of them are stable in the future, since all their perturbations stay bounded at late times. However, they all turn out to be unstable in the past, as their perturbations grow violently when one approaches the initial spacetime singularity. We therefore conclude that the model has no viable solutions describing the whole of the cosmological history, although it may describe the current acceleration phase.

The latter are represented by AdS-Vaidya geometries with an arbitrary parameter characterising the timescale for the dual state to transit from an initial thermal equilibrium to another due to a homogeneous quench. For long quench duration, the spectral function indeed follows the thermal form at the instantaneous effective temperature adiabatically, although with a slight initial time delay and a bit premature thermalisation. At shorter quench durations, several new non-adiabatic features appear: (i) time-dependence of the spectral function is seen much before than that in the effective temperature (advanced time-dependence), (ii) a big transfer of spectral weight to frequencies greater than the initial temperature occurs at an intermediate time (kink formation) and (iii) new peaks with decreasing amplitudes but in greater numbers appear even after the effective temperature has stabilised (persistent oscillations).

In short, the surface tension of the film vanishes in equilibrium due to a thermodynamic identity. This 2D brane can be generalized to a 4D brane with gravity. For the 4D brane, the analogue of the 2D surface tension is the 4D cosmological constant, which is also nullified in full equilibrium. The 4D brane theory provides an alternative description of the phenomenological equation-theory of the quantum vacuum. As for other realizations of the vacuum variable equation, such as the 4-form field-strength realization, the main ingredient is the conservation law for the variable equation, which makes the vacuum a self-sustained system. For a vacuum within this class, the nullification of the cosmological constant takes place automatically in equilibrium.

In this paper, we show that for some elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds with Mordell-Weil rank-one, the Jacobian of the equation model is not minimal. Said another way, starting from a Calabi-Yau Weierstrass model, the total space must be blown up (thereby destroying the ""Calabi-Yau"" property) in order to embed the model into equation.

For equation, the quantum group equation is nothing but the classical group equation, where equation is the symmetric group. For general equation, equation is still an extension of the classical group equation by the classical group equation.

Our approach is based on the forward-backward envelope (FBE), an exact and strictly continuous penalty function for the original cost. Extending previous results we show that, despite being nonsmooth for fully nonconvex problems, the FBE still enjoys favorable first- and second-order properties which are key for the convergence results of ZeroFPR.

The policy is expected to be of greatest value in scenarios where uncertainty is highest and costliest, such as city traffic monitoring during major events. The Bellman equation for an approximation of the proposed inventory routing policy is formulated as a selective vehicle routing problem.

Computational results on the selected instances show that the algorithm can outperform the myopic policy by 23% to 28% over those tests, depending on the parametric design.

Regarding channel estimation, however, sequences of such properties do not necessarily help produce optimal estimates. Tailored unimodular sequences for the specific criterion concerned are desirable especially when the prior knowledge of the channel is taken into account as well. In this paper, we formulate the problem of optimal unimodular sequence design for minimum mean square error estimation of the channel impulse response and conditional mutual information maximization, respectively.

1608.03928,math,"Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of block coordinate update (BCU) methods, which are particularly suitable for problems involving large-sized data and/or variables. In optimization, BCU first appears as the coordinate descent method that works well for smooth problems or those with separable nonsmooth terms and/or separable constraints. As nonseparable constraints exist, BCU can be applied under primal-dual settings.   In the literature, it has been shown that for weakly convex problems with nonseparable linear constraint, BCU with fully Gauss-Seidel updating rule may fail to converge and that with fully Jacobian rule can converge sublinearly. However, empirically the method with Jacobian update is usually slower than that with Gauss-Seidel rule. To maintain their advantages, we propose a hybrid Jacobian and Gauss-Seidel BCU method for solving linearly constrained multi-block structured convex programming, where the objective may have a nonseparable quadratic term and separable nonsmooth terms. At each primal block variable update, the method approximates the augmented Lagrangian function at an affine combination of the previous two iterates, and the affinely mixing matrix with desired nice properties can be chosen through solving a semidefinite programming. We show that the hybrid method enjoys the theoretical convergence guarantee as Jacobian BCU.

The DRA wishes to incentivize the customers both to make costly effort to reduce load and to not falsify the reported load reduction. We model this problem as a contract design problem and present a solution. The proposed contract consists of two parts: a part that depends on (the possibly inflated) load reduction as measured by the DRA and another that provides a share of the profit that accrues to the DRA through the demand response event to the customers.

1605.08527,math,"Optimal transport (OT) defines a powerful framework to compare probability distributions in a geometrically faithful way. However, the practical impact of OT is still limited because of its computational burden. We propose a new class of stochastic optimization algorithms to cope with large-scale problems routinely encountered in machine learning applications. These methods are able to manipulate arbitrary distributions (either discrete or continuous) by simply requiring to be able to draw samples from them, which is the typical setup in high-dimensional learning problems. This alleviates the need to discretize these densities, while giving access to provably convergent methods that output the correct distance without discretization error. These algorithms rely on two main ideas: (a) the dual OT problem can be re-cast as the maximization of an expectation ; (b) entropic regularization of the primal OT problem results in a smooth dual optimization optimization which can be addressed with algorithms that have a provably faster convergence. We instantiate these ideas in three different setups: (i) when comparing a discrete distribution to another, we show that incremental stochastic optimization schemes can beat Sinkhorn's algorithm, the current state-of-the-art finite dimensional OT solver; (ii) when comparing a discrete distribution to a continuous density, a semi-discrete reformulation of the dual program is amenable to averaged stochastic gradient descent, leading to better performance than approximately solving the problem by discretization ; (iii) when dealing with two continuous densities, we propose a stochastic gradient descent over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS).

A well-known consistency condition that is necessary for existence of solutions strongly restricts the possible interaction types between the particles. It was conjectured by Petrat and Tumulka that interactions described by multiplication operators are generally excluded by this condition, and they gave a proof of this claim for potentials without spin-coupling. Under smoothness assumptions of possible solutions we show that there are potentials which are admissible, give an explicit example, however, show that none of them fulfills the physically desirable Poincar\'e invariance. We conclude that in this sense Dirac's multi-time formalism does not allow to model interaction by multiplication operators, and briefly point out several promising approaches to interacting models one can instead pursue.",16,['math'],3

1603.03648,math-ph,"Taking the cue from experiments on actin growth on spherical beads, we formulate and solve a model problem describing the accretion of an incompressible elastic solid on a rigid sphere due to attachment of diffusing free particles. One of the peculiar characteristics of this problem is that accretion takes place on the interior surface that separates the body from its support rather than on its exterior surface, and hence is responsible for stress accumulation. Simultaneously, ablation takes place at the outer surface where material is removed from the body. As the body grows, mechanical effects associated with the build-up of stress and strain energy slow down accretion and promote ablation. Eventually, the system reaches a point where internal accretion is balanced by external ablation. The present study is concerned with this stationary regime called ""treadmilling"".   The principal ingredients of our model are: a nonstandard choice of the reference configuration, which allows us to cope with the continually evolving material structure; and a driving force and a kinetic law for accretion/ablation that involves the difference in chemical potential, strain energy and the radial stress. By combining these ingredients we arrive at an algebraic system which governs the stationary treadmilling state. We establish the conditions under which this system has a solution and we show that this solution is unique. Moreover, by an asymptotic analysis we show that for small beads the thickness of the solid is proportional to the radius of the support and is strongly affected by the stiffness of the solid, whereas for large beads the stiffness of the solid is essentially irrelevant, the thickness being proportional to a characteristic length that depends on the parameters that govern diffusion and accretion kinetics.",16,"['cond-mat', 'math']",3

1603.00946,math-ph,"In 2009, the first author introduced a new class of zeta functions, called `distance zeta functions', associated with arbitrary compact fractal subsets of Euclidean spaces of arbitrary dimension. It represents a natural, but nontrivial extension of the theory of `geometric zeta functions' of bounded fractal strings. In this memoir, we introduce the class of `relative fractal drums' (or RFDs), which contains the classes of bounded fractal strings and of compact fractal subsets of Euclidean spaces as special cases. Furthermore, the associated (relative) distance zeta functions of RFDs, extend (in a suitable sense) the aforementioned classes of fractal zeta functions. This notion is very general and flexible, enabling us to view practically all of the previously studied aspects of the theory of fractal zeta functions from a unified perspective as well as to go well beyond the previous theory. The abscissa of (absolute) convergence of any relative fractal drum is equal to the relative box dimension of the RFD. We pay particular attention to the question of constructing meromorphic extensions of the distance zeta functions of RFDs, as well as to the construction of transcendentally equation-quasiperiodic RFDs (i.e., roughly, RFDs with infinitely many quasiperiods, all of which are algebraically independent). We also describe a class of RFDs (and, in particular, a new class of bounded sets), called \em maximal hyperfractals, such that the critical line of (absolute) convergence consists solely of nonremovable singularities of the associated relative distance zeta functions. Finally, we also describe a class of Minkowski measurable RFDs which possess an infinite sequence of complex dimensions of arbitrary multiplicity equation, and even an infinite sequence of essential singularities along the critical line.",16,['math'],3

An alternative description of the quantum wavesections, in terms of multiparticle states of spinors on equation itself (valued in a prequantization of a multiple of its area form), is also obtained. This viewpoint sheds light on the nature of the quantum solitonic particles that emerge from the gauge theory.

1605.08348,math-ph,"A two-level atom coupled to the radiation field is studied. First principles in physics suggest that the coupling function, representing the interaction between the atom and the radiation field, behaves like equation, as the photon momentum k tends to zero. Previous results on non-existence of ground state eigenvalues suggest that in the most general case binding does not occur in the spin-boson model, i.e., the minimal energy of the atom-photon system is not an eigenvalue of the energy operator. Hasler and Herbst have shown [12], however, that under the additional hypothesis that the coupling function be off-diagonal -which is customary to assume-binding does indeed occur. In this paper an alternative proof of binding in case of off-diagonal coupling is given, i.e., it is proven that, if the coupling function is off-diagonal, the ground state energy of the spin-boson model is an eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian. We develop a multiscale method that can be applied in the situation we study, identifying a new key symmetry operator which we use to demonstrate that the most singular terms appearing in the multiscale analysis vanish.",16,['math'],3
1604.05738,math-ph,"Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), as well as the calculus they imply, are non-unique. The examples of four-dimensional spaces, equation and equation, are considered where different types of arithmetic and calculus coexist simultaneously. In all the examples there exists a non-Diophantine arithmetic that makes the space globally Minkowskian, and thus the laws of physics are formulated in terms of the corresponding calculus. However, when one switches to the `natural' Diophantine arithmetic and calculus, the Minkowskian character of the space is lost and what one effectively obtains is a Lorentzian manifold. I discuss in more detail the problem of electromagnetic fields produced by a pointlike charge. The solution has the standard form when expressed in terms of the non-Diophantine formalism. When the `natural' formalsm is used, the same solution looks as if the fields were created by a charge located in an expanding universe, with nontrivially accelerating expansion. The effect is clearly visible also in solutions of the Friedman equation with vanishing cosmological constant. All of this suggests that phenomena attributed to dark energy may be a manifestation of a miss-match between the arithmetic employed in mathematical modeling, and the one occurring at the level of natural laws.

The proposed SMV shows clear maximum when the embedding delay equation of the incomplete reconstruction matches the time delay equation of the chaotic system. Numerical data generated by a time-delay system based on the Mackey-Glass equation operating in the chaotic regime are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed SMV.

In other situations the clustering coefficient still identifies cyclic motion between regions of the fluid. Besides the fluid context, these ideas apply equally well to general dynamical systems. By varying the value of equation used to construct the network, a kind of spectroscopy can be performed so that the observation of high values of mean clustering at a value of equation reveals the presence of periodic orbits of period equation which impact phase space significantly.

The connection between solutions with a single activated node, which can bifurcate from an undifferentiated state, and the fully developed system-scale patterns are investigated computationally. The different coexisting patterns of activity the network can exhibit are shown to be connected via a snaking type bifurcation structure, similar to those responsible for organising localised pattern formation in regular lattices.

1601.01424,nlin,"We consider the noise-induced transitions in the randomly perturbed discrete logistic map from a linearly stable periodic orbit consisting of T periodic points. The traditional large deviation theory and asymptotic analysis for small noise limit as well as the derived quasi-potential can not distinguish the quantitative difference in noise-induced stochastic instabilities of these T periodic points. We generalize the transition path theory to the discrete-time continuous-space stochastic process to attack this problem. As a first criterion of quantifying the relative instability among T periodic points, we compare the distribution of the last passage locations in the transitions from the whole periodic orbit to a prescribed set far away. This distribution is related to the contributions to the transition rate from each periodic points. The second criterion is based on the competency of the transition paths associated with each periodic point. Both criteria utilise the reactive probability current in the transition path theory. Our numerical results for the logistic map reveal the transition mechanism of escaping from the stable periodic orbit and identify which peri- odic point is more prone to lose stability so as to make successful transitions under random perturbations.",16,[],9

In contrast to the Kerr nonlinearity [10] in optical frequency comb formation, the phononic frequency comb is generated through the intrinsic coupling of a driven phonon mode with an auto-parametrically excited sub-harmonic mode [16]. Through systematic experiments at different drive frequencies and amplitudes, we portray the well-connected process of phononic frequency comb formation and define attributes to control the features [17-18] associated with comb formation in such a system.

So, while synchronization is induced readily by coupling to an identical external system, control to fixed states is achieved only if the external system is dissimilar. We quantify the efficacy of control by estimating the fraction of random initial states that go to fixed points, a measure analogous to basin stability. Lastly, we indicate the generality of this phenomenon by demonstrating suppression of chaotic oscillations by coupling to a common hyper-chaotic system. These results then indicate the easy controllability of chaotic oscillators by an external chaotic system, thereby suggesting a potent method that may help design control strategies.",16,[],9

We explore the effects of heterogeneous coupling phase-lags between the two populations. Such heterogeneity arises naturally in various settings, for example as an approximation to transmission delays, excitatory-inhibitory interactions, or as amplitude and phase responses of oscillators with electrical or mechanical coupling. We find that breaking the phase-lag symmetry results in a variety of states with uniform and non-uniform synchronization, including in-phase and anti-phase synchrony, full incoherence (splay state), chimeras with phase separation of equation or equation between populations, and states where both populations remain desynchronized. These desynchronized states exhibit stable, oscillatory, and even chaotic dynamics. Moreover, we identify the bifurcations through which chimeras emerge. Stable chimera states and desynchronized solutions, which do not arise for homogeneous phase-lag parameters, emerge as a result of competition between synchronized in-phase, anti-phase equilibria, and fully incoherent states when the phase-lags are near equation (cosine coupling).

Optimal conditions for the focusing of many solitons are formulated explicitly. Namely, trains of ordered solitons with alternate polarities evolve to huge strongly localized transient waves. The focused wave amplitude is exactly the sum of the focusing soliton heights; the maximum wave inherits the polarity of the fastest soliton in the train. The focusing of several solitary waves or/and breathers may naturally occur in a soliton gas and will lead to rogue-wave-type dynamics; hence it represents a new nonlinear mechanism of rogue wave generation. The discovered scenario depends crucially on the soliton polarities (phases), and thus cannot be taken into account by existing kinetic theories.

A goodness-of-fit statistics is developed for a linear statistical model of the observations, based on results on central limit theorems for deterministic dynamical systems, and used to detect linear response breakdown. We apply the method to discrete maps which do not obey linear response and show that the successful detection of breakdown depends on the length of the time series, the magnitude of the perturbation and on the choice of the observable.   We find that in order to reliably reject the assumption of linear response for typical observables sufficiently large data sets are needed. Even for simple systems such as the logistic map, one needs of the order of equation observations to reliably detect the breakdown, if less observations are available one may be falsely led to conclude that linear response theory is valid. The amount of data required is larger the smaller the applied perturbation. For judiciously chosen observables the necessary amount of data can be drastically reduced, but requires detailed \ema priori knowledge about the invariant measure which is typically not available for complex dynamical systems.   Furthermore we explore the use of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) in cases with limited data length or coarse-graining of observations.

1607.00842,nlin,"The review is concerned with the nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE) in the presence of disorder. Disorder leads to localization in the form of the localized Anderson modes (AM), while nonlinearity is responsible for the interaction between the AMs and transport. The dynamics of an initially localized wave packets are concerned in both classical and quantum cases. In both cases, there is a subdiffusive spreading, which is explained in the framework of a continuous time random walk (CTRW), and it is shown that subdiffusion is due to the transitions between those AMs, which are strongly overlapped. This overlapping being a common feature of both classical and quantum dynamics, leads to the clustering with an effective trapping of the wave packet inside each cluster. Therefore, the dynamics of the wave packet corresponds to the CTRW, where the basic mechanism of subdiffusion is an entrapping of the wave packet with delay, or waiting, times distributed by the power law equation, where equation is the transport exponent. It is obtained that equation for the classical NLSE and equation for the quantum NLSE.",16,['cond-mat'],9

The probability oscillation dynamics can be physically observed in nanoscale photoexcitation transfer in a quantum-dot network, where the existence probability of an exciton at the bottom energy level of a quantum dot fluctuates dif- ferently with a parameter setting. We evaluate the ensemble average of the time-averaged mean square displacement (ETMSD) of the time series obtained from the quantum-dot network model that generates various oscillatory behaviors because the ETMSD exhibits characteristic changes depending on the fluctuating bias; in the case of normal diffusion, the asymptotic behavior of the ETMSD is proportional to the time (i.e., a linear growth function), whereas it grows nonlinearly with an exponent greater than 1 in the case of superdiffusion. We find that the diffusion can be accelerated significantly when the fluctuating bias is characterized as weak chaos owing to the transient nonstationarity of its biases, in which the spectrum contains high power at low frequen- cies. By introducing a simplified model of our random walk, which exhibits superdiffusion as well as normal diffusion, we explain the mechanism of the accelerated diffusion by analyzing the mean square displacement.",16,[],9

The paper has the remarkable conclusion that the equation state disappears with a potential which is much more attractive than for equation, where a bound state is found. We trace this abnormal conclusion to the fact that an ""on-shell"" factorization of the potential is done in a region where this potential is singular and develops a large discontinuous and unphysical imaginary part. A method is developed, evaluating the loops with full equation propagators, and we show that they do not develop singularities and do not have an imaginary part below threshold. With this result for the loops we define an effective potential, which when used with the Bethe-Salpeter equation provides a state with equation around the energy of the equation. In addition, the coupling of the state to equation is evaluated and we find that this coupling and the equation matrix around the energy of the bound state are remarkably similar to those obtained with a drastic approximation used previously, in which the equation terms of the propagators of the exchanged equation mesons are dropped, once the cut-off in the equation loop function is tuned to reproduce the bound state at the same energy.",16,['hep-ph'],11

Purpose : The purpose of the present study is to assess whether strangeness instabilities are related to specific values of the largely unconstrained hyperon interactions, and to study the effect of the strange meson couplings on phenomenological properties of neutron stars and supernova matter, once these latter are fixed to fulfill the constraints imposed by hypernuclear data. Method : We consider a phenomenological RMF model sufficiently simple to allow a complete exploration of the parameter space. Results : We show that no instability at supersaturation density exists for the RMF model, as long as the parameter space is constrained by basic physical requirements. This is at variance with a non-relativistic functional, with a functional behavior fitted through ab-initio calculations. Once the study is extended to include the full octet, we show that the parameter space allows reasonable radii for canonical neutron stars as well as massive stars above two-solar mass, together with an important strangeness content of the order of 30\%, slightly decreasing with increasing entropy, even in the absence of a strangeness driven phase transition.

The robustness of the method to depth data errors and also to initial and inflow conditions is considered. We illustrate the interest of using two observations instead of one observation into the correction step, especially for unknown inflow boundary conditions. Then, the performance of the Kinect sensor to capture temporal sequences of depth observations is investigated. Finally, the efficiency of the algorithm is qualified for a wave in a real rectangular flat bottom tank. It is shown that for basic initial conditions, the particle filter rapidly and remarkably reconstructs velocity and height of the free surface flow based on noisy measurements of the elevation alone.",16,[],5

1605.09717,physics,"Virialized Ultra-Light Fields (VULFs) are viable cold dark matter candidates and include scalar and pseudo-scalar bosonic fields, such as axions and dilatons. Direct searches for VULFs rely on low-energy precision measurement tools. While the previous proposals have focused on detecting coherent oscillations of the VULF signals at the VULF Compton frequencies at individual devices, here I consider a network of such devices. VULFs are essentially dark matter \em waves and as such they carry both temporal and spatial phase information. Thereby, the discovery reach can be improved by using networks of precision measurement tools. To formalize this idea, I derive a spatio-temporal two-point correlation function for the ultralight dark matter fields in the framework of the standard halo model. Due to VULFs being Gaussian random fields, the derived two-point correlation function fully determines equation-point correlation functions. For a network of equation devices within the coherence length of the field, the sensitivity compared to a single device can be improved by a factor of equation. Further, I derive a VULF dark matter signal profile for an individual device. The resulting line shape is strongly asymmetric due to the parabolic dispersion relation for massive non-relativistic bosons. I discuss the aliasing effect that extends the discovery reach to VULF frequencies higher than the experimental sampling rate. I present sensitivity estimates and develop a stochastic field SNR statistic. Finally, I consider an application of the developed formalism to atomic clocks and their networks.",16,"['astro-ph', 'hep-ph']",5
1606.07982,physics,"We describe a new theoretical and numerical framework of the magnetohydrodynamic simulation incorporated with an anisotropic pressure tensor, which can play an important role in a collisionless plasma. A classical approach to handle the anisotropy is based on the double adiabatic approximation assuming that a pressure tensor is well described only by the components parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field. This gyrotropic assumption, however, fails around a magnetically neutral region, where the cyclotron period may get comparable to or even longer than a dynamical time in a system, and causes a singularity in the mathematical expression. In this paper, we demonstrate that this singularity can be completely removed away by the combination of direct use of the 2nd-moment of the Vlasov equation and an ingenious gyrotropization model. Numerical tests also verify that the present model properly reduces to the standard MHD or the double adiabatic formulation in an asymptotic manner under an appropriate limit.",16,[],5

This is achieved by fabricating a floating metallic structure that concentrates the charge generated by the pyroelectric substrate on the top-gate capacitor of the graphene channel.

1612.07631,physics,"Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are a good alternative to photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) because their gain and quantum efficiency are comparable to PMTs. However, the largest single-chip SiPM is still less than 1~cmequation. In order to use SiPMs with scintillators that have reasonable sensitivity, it is necessary to use multiple SiPMs. In this work, scintillation detectors are constructed and tested with a custom 2x2 SiPM array. The layout of the SiPMs and the geometry of the scintillator were determined by performing Geant4 simulations. Cubic NaI, CsI, and CLYC with 18~mm sides have been tested. The output of the scintillation detectors are stabilized over the temperature range between --20 and 50~equationC by matching the gain of the SiPMs in the array. The energy resolution for these detectors has been measured as a function of temperature. Furthermore, neutron detection for the CLYC detector was studied in the same temperature range. Using pulse-shape discrimination, neutrons can be cleanly identified without contribution from equation-photons. As a result, these detectors are suitable for deploying in spectroscopic personal radiation detectors (SPRD).",16,['astro-ph'],5
1612.04156,physics,"Moving mesh methods provide an efficient way of solving partial differential equations for which large, localised variations in the solution necessitate locally dense spatial meshes. In one-dimension, meshes are typically specified using the arclength mesh density function. This choice is well-justified for piecewise polynomial interpolants, but it is only justified for spectral methods when model solutions include localised steep gradients. In this paper, one-dimensional mesh density functions are presented which are based on a spatially localised measure of the bandwidth of the approximated model solution. In considering bandwidth, these mesh density functions are well-justified for spectral methods, but are not strictly tied to the error properties of any particular spatial interpolant, and are hence widely applicable. The bandwidth mesh density functions are demonstrated by applying periodic spectral and finite-difference moving mesh methods to a number of model problems in acoustics. These problems include a heterogeneous advection equation, the viscous Burgers' equation, and the Korteweg-de Vries equation. Simulation results demonstrate solution convergence rates that are up to an order of magnitude faster using the bandwidth mesh density functions than uniform meshes, and around three times faster than those using the arclength mesh density function.",16,[],5

Following a Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO)-type paradigm, the proposed slope-limiter seeks to reconstruct smooth, non-oscillatory piecewise polynomial profiles as a non-linear combination of the natural and monotone-limited PPM and PQM interpolants. Compared to existing monotone slope-limiting techniques, this new strategy is designed to improve accuracy at smooth extrema, while controlling spurious oscillations in the neighbourhood of sharp features. Using the new slope-limited PPM and PQM interpolants, a high-order accurate Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian framework for advection-dominated flows is constructed, and its effectiveness is examined using a series of one- and two-dimensional benchmark cases.

This phenomenon occurs when a millimetric drop is released on the surface of an oil of the same composition, contained in a tank and subjected to vertical oscillations of frequency and amplitude very close to the Faraday instability threshold. At appropriate values of the parameters of the system under study, the oil droplet jumps permanently on the surface of the vibrating liquid forming a localized wave-particle system, reminding the behaviour of a wave particle quantum system as suggested by de Broglie. In our study, we made relevant simplifying assumptions, however we observe that the wave-drop coupling is surely obtained.

This method exactly conserves both particles and energy and facilitates the integration over the dielectric function. To demonstrate the method, we solve the equilibration problem for a spatially homogeneous one-component plasma with various initial conditions. Unlike the more usual Landau/Fokker-Planck system, this method requires no input Coulomb logarithm; the logarithmic terms in the collision integral arise naturally from the equation along with the non-logarithmic order-unity terms. The spectral method can also be used to solve the Landau equation and a quantum version of the Landau equation in which the integration over the wavenumber requires only a lower cutoff. We solve these problems as well and compare them with the full Lenard-Balescu solution in the weak-coupling limit. Finally, we discuss the possible generalization of this method to include spatial inhomogeneity and velocity anisotropy.",16,[],5

We have developed a biophysical model of kinetochore capture in small fission-yeast nuclei using hybrid Brownian dynamics/kinetic Monte Carlo simulation techniques. With this model, we have studied the importance of dynamic instability and microtubule rotational diffusion for kinetochore capture, both to the lateral surface of a microtubule and at or near its end. Over a range of biologically relevant parameters, microtubule rotational diffusion decreased capture time, but made a relatively small contribution compared to dynamic instability. At most, rotational diffusion reduced capture time by 25%. Our results suggest that while microtubule rotational diffusion can speed up kinetochore capture, it is unlikely to be the dominant physical mechanism. In addition, we found that when microtubules undergo dynamic instability, lateral captures predominate even in the absence of rotational diffusion. Counterintuitively, adding rotational diffusion to a dynamic microtubule increases the probability of end-on capture.",16,['q-bio'],5

1609.00182,physics,"In this paper, the pinning and depinning mechanism of the contact line during droplet evaporation on chemically stripe-patterned surfaces is numerically investigated using a thermal multiphase lattice Boltzmann (LB) model with liquid-vapor phase change. A local force balance in the context of diffuse interfaces is introduced to explain the equilibrium states of droplets on chemically patterned surfaces. It is shown that, when the contact line is pinned on a hydrophobic-hydrophilic boundary, different contact angles can be interpreted as the variation of the length of the contact line occupied by each component. The stick-slip-jump behavior of evaporating droplets on chemically patterned surfaces is well captured by the LB simulations. Particularly, a slow movement of the contact line is clearly observed during the stick (pinning) mode, which shows that the pinning of the contact line during droplet evaporation on chemically stripe-patterned surfaces is actually a dynamic pinning process and the dynamic equilibrium is achieved by the self-adjustment of the contact lines occupied by each component. Moreover, it is shown that, when the surface tension varies with the temperature, the Marangoni effect has an important influence on the depinning of the contact line, which occurs when the horizontal component (towards the center of the droplet) of the force caused by the Marangoni stress overcomes the unbalanced Young's force towards outside.",16,['cond-mat'],5

By compiling and analysing the largest data set so far of year-over-year BMI changes, we find, strikingly, that heavy people on average strongly decrease their weight year-over-year, and light people increase their weight. This drift towards the centre of the BMI distribution is balanced by diffusion resulting from random fluctuations in diet and physical activity that are, notably, proportional in size to BMI. We formulate a stochastic mathematical model for BMI dynamics, deriving a theoretical shape for the BMI distribution and offering a mechanism to explain the ongoing right-skewed broadening of BMI distributions over time.

1607.01449,physics,"We propose a modelling framework to analyse the stochastic behaviour of heterogeneous, multi-scale cellular populations. We illustrate our methodology with a particular example in which we study a population with an oxygen-regulated proliferation rate. Our formulation is based on an age-dependent stochastic process. Cells within the population are characterised by their age. The age-dependent (oxygen-regulated) birth rate is given by a stochastic model of oxygen-dependent cell cycle progression. We then formulate an age-dependent birth-and-death process, which dictates the time evolution of the cell population. The population is under a feedback loop which controls its steady state size: cells consume oxygen which in turns fuels cell proliferation. We show that our stochastic model of cell cycle progression allows for heterogeneity within the cell population induced by stochastic effects. Such heterogeneous behaviour is reflected in variations in the proliferation rate. Within this set-up, we have established three main results. First, we have shown that the age to the G1/S transition, which essentially determines the birth rate, exhibits a remarkably simple scaling behaviour. This allows for a huge simplification of our numerical methodology. A further result is the observation that heterogeneous populations undergo an internal process of quasi-neutral competition. Finally, we investigated the effects of cell-cycle-phase dependent therapies (such as radiation therapy) on heterogeneous populations. In particular, we have studied the case in which the population contains a quiescent sub-population. Our mean-field analysis and numerical simulations confirm that, if the survival fraction of the therapy is too high, rescue of the quiescent population occurs. This gives rise to emergence of resistance to therapy since the rescued population is less sensitive to therapy.",16,['q-bio'],5

The quanta here are small, pre-manufactured three-dimensional units - which we call metamaterial bricks - each encoding a specific phase delay. These bricks can be assembled into meta-surfaces to generate any diffraction-limited acoustic field. We apply this methodology to show experimental examples of acoustic focusing, steering and, after stacking single meta-surfaces into layers, the more complex field of an acoustic tractor beam. We demonstrate experimentally single-sided air-borne acoustic levitation using meta-layers at various bit-rates: from a 4-bit uniform to 3-bit non-uniform quantization in phase. This powerful methodology dramatically simplifies the design of acoustic devices and provides a key-step towards realising spatial sound modulators.",16,[],5
1607.01773,physics,"High-order harmonic generation by a bicircular field, which consists of two coplanar counter-rotating circularly polarized fields of frequency equation and equation (equation and equation are integers), is investigated for a polyatomic molecule. This field possesses dynamical symmetry, which can be adjusted to the symmetry of the molecular Hamiltonian and used to investigate the molecular symmetry. For polyatomic molecules having the equation symmetry only the harmonics equation, equation, are emitted having the ellipticity equation. We illustrate this using the example of the planar molecules BHequation and BFequation, which obey the equation symmetry. We show that for the BFequation molecule, similarly to atoms with a equation ground state, there is a strong asymmetry in the emission of high harmonics with opposite helicities. This asymmetry depends on the molecular orientation.",16,['quant-ph'],5
1602.05255,physics,"We apply Noether's theorem to show how the invariances of conservative systems are broken for nonconservative systems, in the variational formulation of Galley. This formulation considers a conservative action, extended by the inclusion of a time reversed sector and a nonconservative generalized potential. We assume that this potential is invariant under the symmetries of the initial conservative system. The breaking occurs because the time reversed sector requires inverse symmetry transformations, under which the nonconservative potential is not invariant. The resulting violation of the conservation laws is consistent with the equations of motion. We generalize this formulation for fermionic and sypersymmetric systems. In the case of a supersymmetric oscillator, the effect of damping is that the bosonic and fermionic components become different frequencies. Considering that initially the nonconservative action is invariant under supersymmetry, and that the breaking is associated to an instability, this result is reminiscent of spontaneous symmetry breaking.",16,[],5

1606.03696,physics,"When P indistinguishable balls are randomly distributed among L distinguishable boxes, and considering the dense system in which P much greater than L, our natural intuition tells us that the box with the average number of balls has the highest probability and that none of boxes are empty; however in reality, the probability of the empty box is always the highest. This fact is with contradistinction to sparse system in which the number of balls is smaller than the number of boxes (i.e. energy distribution in gas) in which the average value has the highest probability. Here we show that when we postulate the requirement that all possible configurations of balls in the boxes have equal probabilities, a realistic ""long tail"" distribution is obtained. This formalism when applied for sparse systems converges to distributions in which the average is preferred. We calculate some of the distributions resulted from this postulate and obtain most of the known distributions in nature, namely, Zipf law, Benford law, particles energy distributions, and more. Further generalization of this novel approach yields not only much better predictions for election polls, market share distribution among competing companies and so forth, but also a compelling probabilistic explanation for Planck's famous empirical finding that the energy of a photon is hv.",16,[],5

1603.03348,physics,"The advent of MOOCs has stimulated interest in using online videos to deliver content in university courses. We examined student engagement with 78 online videos that we created and were incorporated into a one-semester blended introductory mechanics course at the Georgia Institute of Technology. We found that students were more engaged with videos that supported laboratory activities than with videos that presented lecture content. In particular, the percentage of students accessing laboratory videos was consistently greater than 80 percent throughout the semester while the percentage of students accessing lecture videos dropped to less than 40 percent by the end of the term. Moreover, students were more likely to access the entirety of a laboratory video than a lecture video. Our results suggest that students may access videos based on perceived value: students appear to consider the laboratory videos as essential for successfully completing the laboratories while students appear to consider the lecture videos as something more akin to supplementary material. We found there was little correlation between student engagement with the videos and the performance in the course. In addition, an examination of the in-video content suggests that students focus more on concrete information that is explicitly required for assignment completion (e.g., actions required to complete laboratory work, or formulas/mathematical expressions needed to solve particular problems) and less on content that is considered more conceptual in nature.

To make this ion source useful for applications, it is important to optimize the transfer of energy from the laser into the accelerated ions. One of the most promising ways to achieve this consists in engineering the target front by introducing periodic nanostructures.   In this paper, the effect of these structures on ion acceleration is studied analytically and with multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. We assessed the role of the structure shape, size, and the angle of laser incidence for obtaining the efficient energy transfer. Local control of electron trajectories is exploited to maximise the energy delivered into the target.

Here we reduce the problem of refocusing the beam to the inverse problem of estimating the acoustic aberration due to the biological tissue from acoustic radiative force imaging data. We solve this inverse problem using a Bayesian framework with a hierarchical prior and solve the inverse problem using a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm. The framework is tested using both synthetic and experimental datasets. We demonstrate that our approach has the ability to estimate the aberrations using small datasets, as little as 32 sonication tests, which can lead to significant speedup in the treatment process. Furthermore, our approach is compatible with a wide range of sonication tests and can be applied to other energy-based measurement techniques.",16,['stat'],5

1607.01636,physics,"Classical density functional theory is applied to investigate the validity of a phenomenological force-balance description of the stability of the Cassie state of liquids on substrates with nanoscale corrugation. A bulk free-energy functional of third order in local density is combined with a square-gradient term, describing the liquid-vapor interface. The bulk free energy is parameterized to reproduce the liquid density and the compressibility of water. The square-gradient term is adjusted to model the width of the water-vapor interface. The substrate is modeled by an external potential, based upon Lennard-Jones interactions. The three-dimensional calculation focuses on substrates patterned with nanostripes and square-shaped nanopillars. Using both the force-balance relation and density-functional theory, we locate the Cassie-to-Wenzel transition as a function of the corrugation parameters. We demonstrate that the force-balance relation gives a qualitatively reasonable description of the transition even on the nanoscale. The force balance utilizes an effective contact angle between the fluid and the vertical wall of the corrugation to parameterize the impalement pressure. This effective angle is found to have values smaller than the Young contact angle. This observation corresponds to an impalement pressure that is smaller than the value predicted by macroscopic theory. Therefore, this effective angle embodies effects specific to nanoscopically corrugated surfaces, including the finite range of the liquid-solid potential (which has both repulsive and attractive parts), line tension, and the finite interface thickness. Consistently with this picture, both patterns (stripes and pillars) yield the same effective contact angles for large periods of corrugation.",16,[],5

Here we reveal that the strong coupling between plasmon and phonon polaritons in graphene-BN heterostructures can be used to flip the sign of the group velocity of the resulting hybrid (plasmon-phonon-polariton) modes. We predict all-angle negative refraction between plasmon and phonon polaritons, and even more surprisingly, between hybrid graphene plasmons, and between hybrid phonon polaritons.

1612.02323,physics,"Using Nottale's theory of scale relativity relying on a fractal space-time, we derive a generalized Schrodinger equation taking into account the interaction of the system with the external environment. This equation describes the irreversible evolution of the system towards a static quantum state. We first interpret the scale-covariant equation of dynamics stemming from Nottale's theory as a hydrodynamic viscous Burgers equation for a potential flow involving a complex velocity field and an imaginary viscosity. We show that the Schrodinger equation can be directly obtained from this equation by performing a Cole-Hopf transformation equivalent to the WKB transformation. We then introduce a friction force proportional and opposite to the complex velocity in the scale-covariant equation of dynamics in a way that preserves the local conservation of the normalization condition. We find that the resulting generalized Schrodinger equation, or the corresponding fluid equations obtained from the Madelung transformation, involve not only a damping term but also an effective thermal term. The friction coefficient and the temperature are related to the real and imaginary parts of the complex friction coefficient in the scale-covariant equation of dynamics. This may be viewed as a form of fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We show that our generalized Schrodinger equation satisfies an equation-theorem for the quantum Boltzmann free energy. As a result, the probability distribution relaxes towards an equilibrium state which can be viewed as a Boltzmann distribution including a quantum potential. We propose to apply this generalized Schrodinger equation to dark matter halos in the Universe, possibly made of self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates.",16,[],5

In this paper, we consider the problem of classifying p>>n data and propose a classification method based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Traditional LDA depends on the covariance estimate of the data, but when p>>n the sample covariance estimate is singular. The proposed method estimates the covariance by using a sparse version of noisy principal component analysis (nPCA).

1603.02798,q-bio,"Neuroscientists formulate very different hypotheses about the nature of neural code. At one extreme, it has been argued that neurons encode information in relatively slow changes of individual spikes arriving ""rates codes"" and the irregularity in the spike trains reflects noise in the system, while in the other extreme this irregularity is the temporal codes thus the precise timing of every spike carries additional information about the input. It is known that in the estimation of Shannon information the patterns and temporal structures are taken into account, while the rate code is determined by firing rate. We compare these types of codes for binary Information Sources which model encoded spike-trains. Assuming that the information transmitted by a neuron is governed by uncorrelated stochastic process or by process with a memory we compare the information transmission rates carried by such spike-trains with their firing rates. We showed that the crucial role in the relation between information and firing rates is played by a quantity which we call ""jumping"" parameter. It corresponds to the probabilities of transitions from no-spike-state to the spike-state and vice versa. For low values of jumping parameter the quotient of information and firing rates is monotonically decreasing function of firing rate, thus there is straightforward, one-to-one, relation between temporal and rate codes. On the contrary, it turns out that for large enough jumping parameter this quotient is non-monotonic function of firing rate and it exhibits a global maximum, in this case optimal firing rate exists. Moreover, there is no one-to-one relation between information and firing rates, so the temporal and rate codes differ qualitatively. This leads to the observation that the behavior of the quotient of information and firing rates for large jumping parameter is important in the context of bursting phenomena.",16,[],10
1602.07183,q-bio,"A re-refinement of 4xan, hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) with carboplatin crystallised in NaBr solution, has been made (Tanley et al 2016). This follows our Response article (Tanley et al 2015) to the Critique article of Shabalin et al 2015, suggesting the need for corrections to some solute molecule interpretations of electron density in 4xan and removal of an organic moiety as a ligand to the platinum ion coordinated to His15. We note Shabalin et al (2015) model of a chlorine in that density and a close by bromine at partial occupancy to explain the shape. However, as the bromide concentration is in huge excess over chloride (by 20 fold), we think that the 4yem Shabalin et al 2015 interpretation highly unlikely, but nevertheless we still cannot offer an explanation for that shape, confirming our earlier analysis described in Tanley et al (2014). Following Shabalin et al (2015) reprocessing of the raw diffraction data for 4g4a, we also redid the diffraction data processing for 4xan to a higher resolution using EVAL (Schreurs et al 2010) concluding in favour of 1.3 Angstrom as the resolution limit and which is the basis for our revised PDB file for 4xan (5HMJ). It is very interesting that there is extra X-ray diffraction data from 1.47 to 1.30 Angstrom resolution e.g. with <I/sigma(I)> =0.39 and CC1/2 = 0.181 in the final shell (1.30 to 1.322 Angstrom). In this arXiv article we document in detail our different solvent and split occupancy side chain electron density interpretations as evidence for our statement of approach in our Response article (Tanley et al 2015).

However, some transposons are parasitic, relying on the enzymes produced by the regular transposons. In this case, we show that a stochastic model, which takes into account the small copy numbers of the transposons in a cell, predicts noise-induced predator-prey oscillations with a characteristic time scale that is much longer than the cell replication time, indicating that the state of the predator-prey oscillator is stored in the genome and transmitted to successive generations.

1610.07181,q-bio,"In this paper, we clarify the mechanisms underlying a general phenomenon present in pulse-coupled heterogeneous inhibitory networks: inhibition can induce not only suppression of the neural activity, as expected, but it can also promote neural reactivation. In particular, for globally coupled systems, the number of firing neurons monotonically reduces upon increasing the strength of inhibition (neurons' death). However, the random pruning of the connections is able to reverse the action of inhibition, i.e. in a sparse network a sufficiently strong synaptic strength can surprisingly promote, rather than depress, the activity of the neurons (neurons' rebirth). Thus the number of firing neurons reveals a minimum at some intermediate synaptic strength. We show that this minimum signals a transition from a regime dominated by the neurons with higher firing activity to a phase where all neurons are effectively sub-threshold and their irregular firing is driven by current fluctuations. We explain the origin of the transition by deriving an analytic mean field formulation of the problem able to provide the fraction of active neurons as well as the first two moments of their firing statistics. The introduction of a synaptic time scale does not modify the main aspects of the reported phenomenon. However, for sufficiently slow synapses the transition becomes dramatic, the system passes from a perfectly regular evolution to an irregular bursting dynamics. In this latter regime the model provides predictions consistent with experimental findings for a specific class of neurons, namely the medium spiny neurons in the striatum.",16,"['cond-mat', 'nlin']",10

We show that for biologically relevant rates of cell birth and death, one finds a critical rate, Rcrit, of telomerase activity such that the total number of cells diverges. Further, Rcrit is similar in magnitude to the rates of mitosis and cell death.

1602.04671,q-bio,"The reconstruction of phylogenetic trees from molecular sequence data relies on modelling site substitutions by a Markov process, or a mixture of such processes. In general, allowing mixed processes can result in different tree topologies becoming indistinguishable from the data, even for infinitely long sequences. However, when the underlying Markov process supports linear phylogenetic invariants, then provided these are sufficiently informative, the identifiability of the tree topology can be restored. In this paper, we investigate a class of processes that support linear invariants once the stationary distribution is fixed, the `equal input model'. This model generalizes the `Felsenstein 1981' model (and thereby the Jukes--Cantor model) from four states to an arbitrary number of states (finite or infinite), and it can also be described by a `random cluster' process. We describe the structure and dimension of the vector spaces of phylogenetic mixtures and of linear invariants for any fixed phylogenetic tree (and for all trees -- the so called `model invariants'), on any number equation of leaves. We also provide a precise description of the space of mixtures and linear invariants for the special case of equation leaves.

1601.00716,q-bio,"Infectious diseases are notorious for their complex dynamics, which make it difficult to fit models to test hypotheses. Methods based on state-space reconstruction have been proposed to infer causal interactions in noisy, nonlinear dynamical systems. These ""model-free"" methods are collectively known as convergent cross-mapping (CCM). Although CCM has theoretical support, natural systems routinely violate its assumptions. To identify the practical limits of causal inference under CCM, we simulated the dynamics of two pathogen strains with varying interaction strengths. The original method of CCM is extremely sensitive to periodic fluctuations, inferring interactions between independent strains that oscillate with similar frequencies. This sensitivity vanishes with alternative criteria for inferring causality. However, CCM remains sensitive to high levels of process noise and changes to the deterministic attractor. This sensitivity is problematic because it remains challenging to gauge noise and dynamical changes in natural systems, including the quality of reconstructed attractors that underlie cross-mapping. We illustrate these challenges by analyzing time series of reportable childhood infections in New York City and Chicago during the pre-vaccine era. We comment on the statistical and conceptual challenges that currently limit the use of state-space reconstruction in causal inference.",16,[],10

To take full advantage of these two emerging datasets we need a framework that links them, revealing how collective neural activity arises from the structure of neural connectivity and intrinsic neural dynamics. This problem of \it structure-driven activity has drawn major interest in computational neuroscience. Existing methods for relating activity and architecture in spiking networks rely on linearizing activity around a central operating point and thus fail to capture the nonlinear responses of individual neurons that are the hallmark of neural information processing. Here, we overcome this limitation and present a new relationship between connectivity and activity in networks of nonlinear spiking neurons by developing a diagrammatic fluctuation expansion based on statistical field theory. We explicitly show how recurrent network structure produces pairwise and higher-order correlated activity, and how nonlinearities impact the networks' spiking activity.

Even if there is no definitive answer to this issue, the most common procedure to express this randomness is the use of stochastic models. In accordance with the origin of variability, the sources of randomness are classified as intrinsic or extrinsic and give rise to distinct mathematical frameworks to track down the dynamics of the cell. While the external variability is generally treated by the use of a Wiener process in models such as the Integrate-and-Fire model, the internal variability is mostly expressed via a random firing process. In this paper, we investigate how those distinct expressions of variability can be related. To do so, we examine the probability density functions to the corresponding stochastic models and investigate in what way they can be mapped one to another via integral transforms. Our theoretical findings offer a new insight view into the particular categories of variability and it confirms that, despite their contrasting nature, the mathematical formalization of internal and external variability are strikingly similar.",16,[],10

Many believe that cross-frequency coupling between the amplitude of high frequency local field potential oscillations in one region and the phase of lower frequency signals in another may form a possible mechanism. This work provides a preliminary study from both an experimental and theoretical viewpoint, concentrating on possible coupling between the hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex in rats during tasks involving working memory, spatial navigation and decision making processes. Attempts to search for such coupling events are made using newly developed MATLAB scripts. This leads to the discovery of increased envelope-to-signal correlation (ESC) between the 1-10 Hz hippocampus theta and 30-40 Hz pre-fontal cortex gamma bands when a choice turn is approached during a T-maze task. From a theoretical perspective, a standard connectionist modelling approach is extended to allow for the formation of oscillations.

1611.05669,q-bio,"Dyslexia is a developmental learning disorder of single word reading accuracy and/or fluency, with compelling research directed towards understanding the contributions of the visual system. While dyslexia is not an oculomotor disease, readers with dyslexia have shown different eye movements than typically developing students during text reading. Readers with dyslexia exhibit longer and more frequent fixations, shorter saccade lengths, more backward refixations than typical readers. Furthermore, readers with dyslexia are known to have difficulty in reading long words, lower skipping rate of short words, and high gaze duration on many words. It is an open question whether it is possible to harness these distinctive oculomotor scanning patterns observed during reading in order to develop a screening tool that can reliably identify struggling readers, who may be candidates for dyslexia. Here, we introduce a novel, fast, objective, non-invasive method, named Rapid Assessment of Difficulties and Abnormalities in Reading (RADAR) that screens for features associated with the aberrant visual scanning of reading text seen in dyslexia. Eye tracking parameter measurements that are stable under retest and have high discriminative power, as indicated by their ROC curves, were obtained during silent text reading. These parameters were combined to derive a total reading score (TRS) that can reliably separate readers with dyslexia from typical readers. We tested TRS in a group of school-age children ranging from 8.5 to 12.5 years of age. TRS achieved 94.2% correct classification of children tested.

We systematically activate all possible thalamic and cortical areas with focal stimulation patterns and confirm that the stimulation of specific areas evokes network patterns that closely resemble RS-networks. For some sites, one or no RS-network is engaged, whereas for other sites more than one RS-network may evolve. Our results confirm that the brain is operating at the edge of criticality, wherein stimulation produces a cascade of functional network recruitments, collapsing onto a smaller subspace that is constrained in part by the anatomical local and long-range SCs. We suggest that information flow, and subsequent cognitive processing, follows specific routes imposed by connectome features, and that these routes explain the emergence of RS-networks.

While most efficient spiking simulations rely on the communication of discrete events, rate models require time-continuous interactions between neurons. Exploiting the conceptual similarity to the inclusion of gap junctions in spiking network simulations, we arrive at a reference implementation of instantaneous and delayed interactions between rate-based models in a spiking network simulator. The separation of rate dynamics from the general connection and communication infrastructure ensures flexibility of the framework.

While for binary phylogenetic trees, this number has an exact formula and depends only on the number of leaves and character states but not on the tree topology, the situation is much more complicated for non-binary trees or networks.

We compare conditions for plant coexistence for non-adaptive vs. adaptive pollinators that adjust their foraging strategy to maximize fitness. When pollinators have fixed preferences, we show that plant coexistence typically requires both weak competition between plants for resources (e.g., space or nutrients) and pollinator preferences that are not too biased in favour of either plant. We also show how plant coexistence is promoted by indirect facilitation via the pollinator. When pollinators are adaptive foragers, pollinator's diet maximizes pollinator's fitness measured as the per capita population growth rate. Simulations show that this has two conflicting consequences for plant coexistence. On the one hand, when competition between pollinators is weak, adaptation favours pollinator specialization on the more profitable plant which increases asymmetries in plant competition and makes their coexistence less likely. On the other hand, when competition between pollinators is strong, adaptation promotes generalism, which facilitates plant coexistence.

The inhibitory neurons connect to excitatory projection neurons such that during state (A) the activity of projection neurons is suppressed, while during state (B) patterns of sequential firing of projection neurons can occur. The latter state is stabilized by feedback from the projection to the inhibitory neurons. Song composition for specific species is distinguished by the manner in which different FSUs are functionally connected to each other.   Ours is a computational model built with biophysically based neurons. We illustrate that many observations of HVC activity are explained by the dynamics of the proposed population of FSUs, and we identify aspects of the model that are currently testable experimentally. In addition, and standing apart from the core features of an FSU, we propose that the transition between modes may be governed by the biophysical mechanism of neuromodulation.",16,['physics'],10
1612.00098,q-bio,"Metabolism is a foundation of life. Metabolic rate of organisms (amount of energy produced per unit time) increases slower than organisms' mass, which has important consequences for life organization. This phenomenon, when considered across different taxa, is called interspecific allometric scaling. Here, on the basis of introduced biomechanical models, physiological and evolutionary principles, we discover and validate its fundamental mechanisms. Calculated theoretical values of allometric exponents for the maximal and basal metabolic rates, for mammals, reptiles, fish and birds, correspond to experimental data. This proves that the cooperative action of discovered mechanisms, indeed, is the cause of this phenomenon, and that allometric scaling is rather a statistical effect of individual evolutionary and physiological adaptations of organisms within the food chain, both in terms of metabolism and biomechanical constraints. The increase in size is coupled with the increase of the overall metabolic rate due to the change of biomechanical characteristics and the need to meet certain functional requirements for a successful reproduction (like the speed advantage over the prey). On one hand, organisms have to reliably acquire sufficient food for that. On the other hand, neither biomechanical nor metabolic advantage can be too strong - otherwise, the food chain could be destroyed. The counteraction of these two needs establishes a dynamic balance in the food chain, which, together with biomechanical constraints, explains the phenomenon of allometric scaling. Once acknowledged, this discovery will have numerous important implications in ecological, evolutionary, physiological and other studies, as well as in practical applications.",16,[],10

Strikingly, both computer simulations and experiments have recently shown that for the same geometry of the reaction volume, different oscillation patterns can be stable, with stochastic switching between them. Here we use particle-based Brownian dynamics simulations to predict the relative frequency of different oscillation patterns over a large range of three-dimensional compartment geometries, in excellent agreement with experimental results. Fourier analyses as well as pattern recognition algorithms are used to automatically identify the different oscillation patterns and the switching rates between them. We also identify novel oscillation patterns in three-dimensional compartments with membrane-covered walls and identify a linear relation between the bound Min-protein densities and the volume-to-surface ratio.

1609.00788,q-bio,"Neglected tropical diseases (NTD), particularly vector-borne diseases (VBD), account for a large proportion of the global disease burden, and their control faces several challenges including diminishing human and financial resources for those distressed from such diseases. Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), the second-largest parasitic killer in the world (after malaria) affects poor populations in endemic countries and causes considerable cost to the affected individuals and their society. Mathematical models can serve as a critical tool for understanding the driving mechanisms of a NTD such as VL. The WHO promotes integrated control programs for VL but this policy is not well supported by systematic quantitative and dynamic evidence and so potential benefits of the policy are limited. Moreover, mathematical models can be readily developed and used to understand the functioning of the VL system cheaply and systematically. The focus of this research is three-fold: (i) to identify non-traditional but critical mechanisms for ongoing VL transmission in resource limited regions, (ii) to review mathematical models used for other infectious diseases that have the potential to capture identified factors of VL, and (iii) to suggest novel quantitative models for understanding VL dynamics and for evaluating control programs in such frameworks for achieveing VL elimination goals.",16,[],10
1602.01743,q-bio,"Time course data are often used to study the changes to a biological process after perturbation. Statistical methods have been developed to determine whether such a perturbation induces changes over time, e.g. comparing a perturbed and unperturbed time course dataset to uncover differences. However, existing methods do not provide a principled statistical approach to identify the specific time when the two time course datasets first begin to diverge after a perturbation; we call this the perturbation time. Estimation of the perturbation time for different variables in a biological process allows us to identify the sequence of events following a perturbation and therefore provides valuable insights into likely causal relationships.   In this paper, we propose a Bayesian method to infer the perturbation time given time course data from a wild-type and perturbed system. We use a non-parametric approach based on Gaussian Process regression. We derive a probabilistic model of noise-corrupted and replicated time course data coming from the same profile before the perturbation time and diverging after the perturbation time. The likelihood function can be worked out exactly for this model and the posterior distribution of the perturbation time is obtained by a simple histogram approach, without recourse to complex approximate inference algorithms. We validate the method on simulated data and apply it to study the transcriptional change occurring in Arabidopsis following inoculation with P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 versus the disarmed strain DC3000hrpA.

1601.04458,q-bio,"Ordinary differential equations (ODE) are widely used for modeling in Systems Biology. As most commonly only some of the kinetic parameters are measurable or precisely known, parameter estimation techniques are applied to parametrize the model to experimental data. A main challenge for the parameter estimation is the complexity of the parameter space, especially its high dimensionality and local minima.   Parameter estimation techniques consist of an objective function, measuring how well a certain parameter set describes the experimental data, and an optimization algorithm that optimizes this objective function. A lot of effort has been spent on developing highly sophisticated optimization algorithms to cope with the complexity in the parameter space, but surprisingly few articles address the influence of the objective function on the computational complexity in finding global optima. We extend a recently developed multiple shooting for stochastic systems (MSS) objective function for parameter estimation of stochastic models and apply it to parameter estimation of ODE models. This MSS objective function treats the intervals between measurement points separately. This separate treatment allows the ODE trajectory to stay closer to the data and we show that it reduces the complexity of the parameter space.   We use examples from Systems Biology, namely a Lotka-Volterra model, a FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillator and a Calcium oscillation model, to demonstrate the power of the MSS approach for reducing the complexity and the number of local minima in the parameter space. The approach is fully implemented in the COPASI software package and, therefore, easily accessible for a wide community of researchers.",16,['cs'],10

The powder was sieved and particles in the range of 45 to 63 microns were collected. The powdered sea shells were characterized using X-Ray Diffraction and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy. The XRD data showed that the particles were mainly microspheres. Traces of calcite and vaterite were also present. Experiments were conducted to study the aspirin and strontium ranelate drug loading into the sea shell powder using soak and dry method. Different concentrations of drug solution was made in ethanol and water. The shell powder was soaked in drug solutions and was kept soaking for 48 hrs with intermittent ultrasonication. The mixture was gently dried in a vacuum oven. The in vitro drug release studies were done using Phosphate Buffered Saline. The FESEM images displayed a distribution of differently sized and shaped particles. The sea shells due to its natural porosity and crystallinity are expected to be useful for drug delivery. About 50% drug entrapment efficiency for aspirin and 39% for strontium ranelate was seen. A burst release of the drug (80 percent) was observed within two hours for both the drugs studied.

Growth and metabolism of cyanobacteria are inherently tied to the diurnal rhythm of light availability. As yet, however, insight into the stoichiometric and energetic constraints of cyanobacterial diurnal growth is limited. Here, we develop a computational platform to evaluate the optimality of diurnal phototrophic growth using a high-quality genome-scale metabolic reconstruction of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. We formulate phototrophic growth as a self-consistent autocatalytic process and evaluate the resulting time-dependent resource allocation problem using constraint-based analysis. Based on a narrow and well defined set of parameters, our approach results in an ab initio prediction of growth properties over a full diurnal cycle. In particular, our approach allows us to study the optimality of metabolite partitioning during diurnal growth. The cyclic pattern of glycogen accumulation, an emergent property of the model, has timing characteristics that are shown to be a trade-off between conflicting cellular objectives. The approach presented here provides insight into the time-dependent resource allocation problem of phototrophic diurnal growth and may serve as a general framework to evaluate the optimality of metabolic strategies that evolved in photosynthetic organisms under diurnal conditions.",16,[],10
1610.06311,q-bio,"We develop a theoretical framework on the mechanism of combinatorial binding of transcription factors (TFs) with their specific binding sites on DNA. We consider three possible mechanisms viz. monomer, hetero-oligomer and coordinated recruitment pathways. In the monomer pathway, combinatorial TFs search for their targets in an independent manner and the protein-protein interactions among them will be insignificant. The protein-protein interactions are very strong so that the hetero-oligomer complex of TFs as a whole searches for the cognate sites in case of hetero-oligomer pathway. The TF which arrived first will recruit the adjacent TFs in a sequential manner in the recruitment pathway. The free energy released from the protein-protein interactions among TFs will be in turn utilized to stabilize the TFs-DNA complex. Such coordinated binding of TFs in fact emerges as the cooperative effect. Monomer and hetero-oligomer pathways are efficient only when few TFs are involved in the combinatorial regulation. Detailed random walk simulations suggest that when the number of TFs in a combination increases then the searching efficiency of TFs in these pathways decreases with the increasing number of TFs in a power law manner. The power law exponent associated with the monomer pathway seems to be strongly dependent on the number of TFs, distance between the initial position of TFs from their specific binding sites and the hop size associated with the dynamics of TFs on DNA.",16,['physics'],10

1605.04959,q-bio,"The availability of databases electronically encoding curated regulatory networks and of high-throughput technologies and methods to discover regulatory interactions provides an invaluable source of data to understand the principles underpinning the organization and evolution of these networks responsible for cellular regulation. Nevertheless, data on these sources never goes beyond the regulon level despite the fact that regulatory networks are complex hierarchical-modular structures still challenging our understanding. This brings the necessity for an inventory of systems across a large range of organisms, a key step to rendering feasible comparative systems biology approaches. In this work, we take the first step towards a global understanding of the regulatory networks organization by making a cartography of the functional architectures of diverse bacteria. Abasy (Across-bacteria systems) Atlas provides a comprehensive inventory of annotated functional systems, global network properties, and systems-level elements (global regulators, modular genes shaping functional systems, basal machinery genes, and intermodular genes) predicted by the natural decomposition approach for reconstructed and meta-curated regulatory networks across a large range of bacteria, including pathogenically and biotechnologically relevant organisms.

In this paper we explore these results by including social transfer mechanisms to our agents and contrasting their reproductive behavior with a control group without social transfer mechanisms.

1612.03567,q-bio,"Current models of animal evolution focus on selection of individuals, ignoring the much faster selection of symbiotic bacteria. Here we take host-symbiont interactions into account by introducing a Population Genetics-like model of holobionts exposed to toxic stress. The stress can be alleviated by selection of resistant individuals (host and bacteria) and by secretion of a detoxification agent (""detox""). By defining a new measure, termed the Lamarckian, we show that selection of resistant bacteria over one generation of hosts leads to stress-dependent increase in the tolerance of the host's offspring. This benefit is mediated by co-alleviation of toxic and physiologic stress. Prolonged exposure leads to further adaptation by 'group selection' of bacterial communities with higher detox per bacterium. These findings show that Lamarckian adaptation can arise via interactions between two levels of Darwinian selection within a holobiont system. The conclusions and modelling framework are applicable to diverse types of holobiont systems.",16,[],10

Based on this, we propose a minimal model for the evolution of a large bacterial population that captures this trade-off. The scaling relationships observed in experiments encode, in such frameworks, for the same distance from the maximum achievable growth rate, the same degree of growth rate maximization, and/or the same rate of phenotypic change.

The Lake Kariba area of Southern Province, Zambia, is part of a multi-country elimination effort and presents a particular challenge as it is an interconnected region of variable transmission intensities.   Methods In 2012-13, six rounds of mass-screen-and-treat drug campaigns were carried out in the Lake Kariba region. A spatial dynamical model of malaria transmission in the Lake Kariba area, with transmission and climate modeled at the village scale, was calibrated to the 2012-13 prevalence survey data, with case management rates, insecticide-treated net usage, and drug campaign coverage informed by surveillance. The model was used to simulate the effect of various interventions implemented in 2014-22 on reducing regional transmission, achieving elimination by 2022, and maintaining elimination through 2028.   Findings The model captured the spatio-temporal trends of decline and rebound in malaria prevalence in 2012-13 at the village scale. Simulations predicted that elimination required repeated mass drug administrations coupled with simultaneous increase in net usage. Drug campaigns targeted only at high-burden areas were as successful as campaigns covering the entire region.   Interpretation Elimination in the Lake Kariba region is possible through coordinating mass drug campaigns with high-coverage vector control. Targeting regional hotspots is a viable alternative to global campaigns when human migration within an interconnected area is responsible for maintaining transmission in low-burden areas.",16,[],10

In neuroscience, non-invasive imaging tools are extensively used to derive either structural or functional brain networks in-vivo. As a result of the inference process, we obtain a matrix of values corresponding to an unrealistic fully connected and weighted network. To turn this into a useful sparse network, thresholding is typically adopted to cancel a percentage of the weakest connections. The structural properties of the resulting network depend on how much of the inferred connectivity is eventually retained. However, how to fix this threshold is still an open issue. We introduce a criterion, the efficiency cost optimization (ECO), to select a threshold based on the optimization of the trade-off between the efficiency of a network and its wiring cost. We prove analytically and we confirm through numerical simulations that the connection density maximizing this trade-off emphasizes the intrinsic properties of a given network, while preserving its sparsity. Moreover, this density threshold can be determined a-priori, since the number of connections to filter only depends on the network size according to a power-law. We validate this result on several brain networks, from micro- to macro-scales, obtained with different imaging modalities.

We use a statistical framework to relate the timing to the precision of the parameter estimates, specifically, the sum of the relative widths of their confidence intervals. We illustrate this computationally using the STERGM suite of the statnet package to estimate the parameters of the network dynamics. Analytically, we derive simple approximations for the optimal timing when the parameters correspond to the rates for different network events.

1607.00998,q-bio,"We introduce a model called Host-Pathogen game for studying biological competitions. Notably, we focus on the invasive dynamics of external agents, like bacteria, within a host organism. The former are mapped to a population of defectors that aim to spread in the extracellular medium of the host. In turn, the latter is composed of cells, mapped to a population of cooperators, that aim to kill pathogens. The cooperative behavior of cells is fundamental for the emergence of the living functions of the whole organism, since each one contributes to a specific set of tasks. So, broadly speaking, their contribution can be viewed as a form of energy. When bacteria are spatially close to a cell, the latter can use a fraction of its energy to remove them. On the other hand, when bacteria survive an attack, they absorb the received energy, becoming stronger and more resistant to further attacks. In addition, since bacteria play as defectors, their unique target is to increase their wealth, without supporting their own kind. As in many living organisms, the host temperature plays a relevant role in the host-pathogen equilibrium. For instance, in animals like human beings, a neural mechanism triggers the increasing of the body temperature in order to activate the immune system. Here, cooperators succeed once bacteria are completely removed while, in the opposite scenario, the host undergoes a deep invasive process, like a blood poisoning. Results of numerical simulations show that the dynamics of the proposed model allow to reach a variety of states. At a very high level of abstraction, some of these states seem to be similar to those that can be observed in some living systems. Therefore, to conclude, we deem that our model might be exploited for studying further biological phenomena.",16,['nlin'],10

Here we apply a rigorous inference framework, drawn from population genetics, to distinguish between two broad mechanisms of language change: drift and selection. Drift is change that results from stochasticity in transmission and it may occur in the absence of any intrinsic difference between linguistic forms; whereas selection is truly an evolutionary force arising from intrinsic differences -- for example, when one form is preferred by members of the population. Using large corpora of parsed texts spanning the 12th century to the 21st century, we analyze three examples of grammatical changes in English: the regularization of past-tense verbs, the rise of the periphrastic `do', and syntactic variation in verbal negation. We show that we can reject stochastic drift in favor of a selective force driving some of these language changes, but not others. The strength of drift depends on a word's frequency, and so drift provides an alternative explanation for why some words are more prone to change than others. Our results suggest an important role for stochasticity in language change, and they provide a null model against which selective theories of language evolution must be compared.",16,['cs'],10
1603.06335,q-bio,"Self-assembly of proteins is a biological phenomenon which gives rise to spontaneous formation of amyloid fibrils or polymers. The starting point of this phase, called nucleation exhibits an important variability among replicated experiments.To analyse the stochastic nature of this phenomenon, one of the simplest models considers two populations of chemical components: monomers and polymerised monomers. Initially there are only monomers. There are two reactions for the polymerization of a monomer: either two monomers collide to combine into two polymerised monomers or a monomer is polymerised after the encounter of a polymerised monomer. It turns out that this simple model does not explain completely the variability observed in the experiments. This paper investigates extensions of this model to take into account other mechanisms of the polymerization process that may have impact an impact on fluctuations.The first variant consists in introducing a preliminary conformation step to take into account the biological fact that, before being polymerised, a monomer has two states, regular or misfolded. Only misfolded monomers can be polymerised so that the fluctuations of the number of misfolded monomers can be also a source of variability of the number of polymerised monomers. The second variant represents the reaction rate equation of spontaneous formation of a polymer as of the order of equation, with equation some positive constant. First and second order results for the starting instant of nucleation are derived from these limit theorems.

1606.00261,q-bio,"Aim: To assess the relationship between oral health and asthma. Methods: Data from 1,315 overweight or obese individuals, aged 40-65 years was used. Asthma was self-reported, while periodontitis, bleeding on probing (BOP), and plaque index were determined by clinical examinations. Results: Using logistic regression adjusting for gender, smoking status, age, body mass index, family history of asthma, and income level, revealed that the odds ratio (OR) of asthma for a participant with severe periodontitis was 0.44 (95% confidence interval: 0.27, 0.70) that of a participant with none/mild periodontitis . On the other hand, proportion of BOP sites, and plaque index were not statistically significant. For a participant with severe periodontitis, the OR of taking asthma medication was 0.20 (95% confidence interval: 0.09, 0.43) that of a participant with none/mild periodontitis. Moreover, proportion of BOP sites was statistically associated to use of asthma medication while plaque index still remained non-significant.

However, the physical mechanisms yielding supramolecular organization and collective function of membrane proteins remain largely unknown. Here we show that bilayer-mediated elastic interactions between membrane proteins can yield regular and distinctive lattice architectures of protein clusters, and may provide a link between lattice architecture and lattice function. Using the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) as a model system, we obtain relations between the shape of MscL and the supramolecular architecture of MscL lattices. We predict that the tetrameric and pentameric MscL symmetries observed in previous structural studies yield distinct lattice architectures of MscL clusters and that, in turn, these distinct MscL lattice architectures yield distinct lattice activation barriers.

1608.05706,q-bio,"Sensory neurons give highly variable responses to stimulation, which can limit the amount of stimulus information available to downstream circuits. Much work has investigated the factors that affect the amount of information encoded in these population responses, leading to insights about the role of covariability among neurons, tuning curve shape, etc. However, the informativeness of neural responses is not the only relevant feature of population codes; of potentially equal importance is how robustly that information propagates to downstream structures. For instance, to quantify the retina's performance, one must consider not only the informativeness of the optic nerve responses, but also the amount of information that survives the spike-generating nonlinearity and noise corruption in the next stage of processing, the lateral geniculate nucleus. Our study identifies the set of covariance structures for the upstream cells that optimize the ability of information to propagate through noisy, nonlinear circuits. Within this optimal family are covariances with ""differential correlations"", which are known to reduce the information encoded in neural population activities. Thus, covariance structures that maximize information in neural population codes, and those that maximize the ability of this information to propagate, can be very different.",16,[],10

1605.07124,q-bio,"Gene transcription is a highly stochastic and dynamic process. As a result, the mRNA copy number of a given gene is heterogeneous both between cells and across time. We present a framework to model gene transcription in populations of cells with time-varying (stochastic or deterministic) transcription and degradation rates. Such rates can be understood as upstream cellular drives representing the effect of different aspects of the cellular environment. We show that the full solution of the master equation contains two components: a model-specific, upstream effective drive, which encapsulates the effect of cellular drives (e.g., entrainment, periodicity or promoter randomness), and a downstream transcriptional Poissonian part, which is common to all models. Our analytical framework treats cell-to-cell and dynamic variability consistently, unifying several approaches in the literature. We apply the obtained solution to characterise different models of experimental relevance, and to explain the influence on gene transcription of synchrony, stationarity, ergodicity, as well as the effect of time-scales and other dynamic characteristics of drives.

The relevance to protein-solvent interaction of these physical and geometrical properties is supported by strong correlations between them and known hydrophobicity scales and by their large changes upon protein unfolding. The universal existence of negative surface charge and dipole, the characteristic surface geometry and power laws reveal fundamental but distinct roles of surface charge and SES in protein-solvent interaction and make it possible to describe solvation and hydrophobic effect using theories on anion solute in protic solvent. In particular the great significance of surface charge for protein-solvent interaction suggests that a change of perception may be needed since from solvation perspective folding into a native state is to optimize surface negative charge rather than to minimize the hydrophobic surface area.",16,[],10

We argue for a one-signal model (with stochastic influences) as the explanation for T cell activation in preference to the widely accepted two-signal model of co-stimulation. Convincing evidence for our one-signal model emerged from the widespread autoimmune adverse events in 64.2% of advanced melanoma patients treated with the anti-CTLA-4 antibody (ipilimumab) that blocks an immune checkpoint.

In vitro, protein corona and stability assays show that phosphonic acid PEG copolymers outperform all other coating types examined, including low molecular weight anionic ligands and polymers. In vivo, the particle pharmacokinetics is investigated by monitoring the MRI signal intensity from mouse liver, spleen and arteries as a function of the time, between one minute and seven days after injection.

So far, it is unclear in which way Red Queen dynamics persists with more than two types of hosts and parasites. In our analysis, an arbitrary number of types within two species are examined in a deterministic framework with constant or changing population size. This general framework allows for analytical solutions for internal fixed points and their stability. For more than two species, apparently chaotic dynamics has been reported. Here we show that even for two species, once more than two types are considered per species, irregular dynamics in their frequencies can be observed in the long run.

In general, one can find certain combinations of initial states and channels acting on one or both subsystems that can result in entanglement sudden death or not. Neither the channel nor the initial state, but their combination, is responsible for this effect, but their combination. In this work we show that, in all cases, when entanglement sudden death occurs, the evolution can be mapped to that of an effective entanglement breaking channel on a modified initial state. Our results allow to anticipate which states will suffer entanglement sudden death or not for a given evolution.

Numerical simulations are performed for optimal control of mode-to-mode transitions between the ground coherent mode and excited modes of a BEC trapped in a harmonic well. The results show greater than 99% success for nearly all trials utilizing reasonable initial guesses for the controls, and analysis of the optimal controls reveals primarily direct transitions between initial and target modes.

This is because while the degree of entanglement of BO states is determined by their deviation from the corresponding states in the crude BO approximation, the accuracy of the BO approximation is dictated, instead, by the deviation of the BO states from the exact electron-nuclear states. In fact, in the context of a minimal avoided crossing model, extreme cases are identified where an adequate BO state is seen to be maximally entangled, and where the BO approximation fails but the associated BO state remains approximately unentangled.

We consider two probes individually interacting with the inaccessible object, but not with each other. The schemes are based on monitoring entanglement dynamics between the probes. Our method is robust and experimentally friendly as it allows the probes and the object to be open systems, makes no assumptions about the initial state, dimensionality of involved Hilbert spaces and details of the probe-object Hamiltonian.

Specifically, by guaranteeing the property of not-Post-Peierls (equationPP) compatibility (or antidistinguishability) for a particular set of states equation, together with the ad hoc postulate known as Preparation Independence Postulate (PIP), the theorem establishes that these two properties imply the equation-onticity (realism) of the set of all pure states. This PBR result has triggered two particular lines of research: On the one hand, it has been possible to derive similar results without the use of the PIP, although at the expense of implying weaker properties than equation-onticity. On the other hand, it has also been proven that the property of equationPP compatibility alone is an explicit witness of usefulness for the task known as conclusive exclusion of states. In this work, we explore the equationPP compatibility of the set of states equation, when equation is under the interaction of some noisy channels, which would consequently let us identify some noisy scenarios where it is still possible to perform the task of conclusive exclusion of states. Specifically, we consider the set equation of equation-qubit states in interaction with an environment by means of i) individual and ii) collective couplings.

This generalizes a result obtained for continuous-variable systems to the discrete-variable-system case. This is significant because testing entanglement in terms of an uncertainty relation has a physically appealing interpretation. We study the case of a Werner state, which is a mixed state constructed as a convex combination with a parameter equation of a Bell state equation and the completely incoherent state, equation: we find that for equation, where equation is obtained as a function of the dimensionality equation, the uncertainty relation for the partially transposed Werner state is violated and the original Werner state is entangled.",16,"['math-ph', 'math']",6

From this point of view we carry out an analysis of an open quantum system whose dynamics are governed by an asymptotically harmonic Hamiltonian and compact type Lindblad operators. It is established that the initial value problem of the equivalent nonlocal but classical evolution is well posed in the appropriately chosen Sobolev spaces.   The second set of results pertains to a generalization of the basic Q-transform and highlights a certain type of asymptotic redundancy.

As opposed to the Landauer case, the cost of erasure in this case is associated with the discrete variable.   Here we study the \it discrete fluctuations in this cost and the probability of violation of the VB bound. We also obtain a Jarzynski-like equality for the VB erasure protocol. We find that the fluctuations below the VB bound are exponentially suppressed at a far greater rate and more tightly than for an equivalent Jarzynski expression for VB erasure. We expose a trade-off between the size of the fluctuations and the cost of erasure. We find that the discrete nature of the fluctuations is pronounced in the regime where reservoir spins are maximally polarized.

The formalism allows us to calculate the spectrum when the Floquet states and quasienergies are analytically or numerically solved for simple or complicated driving fields. We can systematically explore the spectral features by implementing the present formalism. To exemplify this theory, we apply the unified formalism to comprehensively study a generic model that a harmonically driven TLS is simultaneously coupled to a radiative reservoir and a dephasing reservoir. We demonstrate that the significant features of the fluorescence spectra, the driving-induced asymmetry and the dephasing-induced asymmetry, can be attributed to the violation of detailed balance condition, and explained in terms of the driving-related transition quantities between Floquet-states and their steady populations. In addition, we find the distinguished features of the fluorescence spectra under the biharmonic and multiharmonic driving fields in contrast with that of the harmonic driving case. In the case of the biharmonic driving, we find that the spectra is significantly different from the result of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) under the multiple resonance conditions.

In the quantum-Rabi probe, the residual spin-phonon coupling vanishes, which makes this sensing protocol naturally robust to thermally-induced spin dephasing. We show that the proposed techniques can be used to sense the axial and transverse components of the force with a sensitivity beyond the yN equation range, i.e. in the xNequation (xennonewton, equation).

1609.08025,quant-ph,"We report on some quantum properties of physical systems, namely, entanglement, nonlocality, equation-copy nonlocality (superactivation of nonlocality), hidden nonlocality (activation of nonlocality through local filtering) and the activation of nonlocality through tensoring and local filtering. The aim of this work is two-fold. First, we provide a review of the numerical procedures that must be followed in order to calculate the aforementioned properties, in particular, for any two-qubit system, and reproduce the bounds for two-qudit Werner states. Second, we use such numerical tools to calculate new bounds of these properties for two-qudit Isotropic states and two-qubit Hirsch states.",16,[],6
1609.07611,quant-ph,"We employ the conditional version of sandwiched Tsallis relative entropy to determine 1:N-1 separability range in the noisy one-parameter families of pseudopure and Werner-like N-qubit W, GHZ states. The range of the noisy parameter, for which the conditional sandwiched Tsallis relative entropy is positive, reveals perfect agreement with the necessary and sufficient criteria for the separability in the 1:N-1 partition of these one parameter noisy states.",16,[],6
1608.00907,quant-ph,"We report our experimental results on phase-sensitive amplification (PSA) in non-degenerate signal-idler configuration using ultra-narrow coherent population oscillations in metastable helium at room temperature. We achieved a high PSA gain of nearly 7 with a bandwidth of 200 kHz, by using the system at resonance in a single-pass scheme. Further, the measured minimum gain is close to the ideal value, showing that we have a pure PSA. This is also confirmed from our phase-to-phase transfer curves measurements, illustrating that we have a nearly perfect squeezer, which is interesting for a variety of applications.",16,[],6
1606.04520,quant-ph,"Time resolved intensity cross-correlation measurements of radiative cascades are used for studying non-radiative relaxation processes of excited carriers confined in semiconductor quantum dots. We spectrally identify indirect radiative cascades which include intermediate phonon assisted relaxations. The energy of the first photon reveals the multicarrier configuration prior to the non-radiative relaxation, while the energy of the second photon reveals the configuration after the relaxation. The intensity cross correlation measurements thus provide quantitative measures of the non-radiative processes and their selection rules. We construct a model which accurately describes the experimental observations in terms of the electron-phonon and electron-hole exchange interactions. Our measurements and model provide a new tool for engineering relaxation processes in semiconductor nanostructures.",16,['cond-mat'],6
1610.09805,quant-ph,"This article reviews theoretical and experimental advances in Efimov physics, an array of quantum few-body and many-body phenomena arising for particles interacting via short-range resonant interactions, that is based on the appearance of a scale-invariant three-body attraction theoretically discovered by Vitaly Efimov in 1970. This three-body effect was originally proposed to explain the binding of nuclei such as the triton and the Hoyle state of carbon-12, and later considered as a simple explanation for the existence of some halo nuclei. It was subsequently evidenced in trapped ultra-cold atomic clouds and in diffracted molecular beams of gaseous helium. These experiments revealed that the previously undetermined three-body parameter introduced in the Efimov theory to stabilise the three-body attraction typically scales with the range of atomic interactions. The few- and many-body consequences of the Efimov attraction have been since investigated theoretically, and are expected to be observed in a broader spectrum of physical systems.",16,"['cond-mat', 'nucl-th', 'physics']",6
1602.00008,quant-ph,"We construct a new class of quantum error-correcting codes for a bosonic mode which are advantageous for applications in quantum memories, communication, and scalable computation. These 'binomial quantum codes' are formed from a finite superposition of Fock states weighted with binomial coefficients. The binomial codes can exactly correct errors that are polynomial up to a specific degree in bosonic creation and annihilation operators, including amplitude damping and displacement noise as well as boson addition and dephasing errors. For realistic continuous-time dissipative evolution, the codes can perform approximate quantum error correction to any given order in the timestep between error detection measurements. We present an explicit approximate quantum error recovery operation based on projective measurements and unitary operations. The binomial codes are tailored for detecting boson loss and gain errors by means of measurements of the generalized number parity. We discuss optimization of the binomial codes and demonstrate that by relaxing the parity structure, codes with even lower unrecoverable error rates can be achieved. The binomial codes are related to existing two-mode bosonic codes but offer the advantage of requiring only a single bosonic mode to correct amplitude damping as well as the ability to correct other errors. Our codes are similar in spirit to 'cat codes' based on superpositions of the coherent states, but offer several advantages such as smaller mean number, exact rather than approximate orthonormality of the code words, and an explicit unitary operation for repumping energy into the bosonic mode. The binomial quantum codes are realizable with current superconducting circuit technology and they should prove useful in other quantum technologies, including bosonic quantum memories, photonic quantum communication, and optical-to-microwave up- and down-conversion.",16,[],6
1606.09514,quant-ph,"The question of how large Bell inequality violations can be, for quantum distributions, has been the object of much work in the past several years. We say that a Bell inequality is normalized if its absolute value does not exceed 1 for any classical (i.e. local) distribution. Upper and (almost) tight lower bounds have been given for the quantum violation of these Bell inequalities in terms of number of outputs of the distribution, number of inputs, and the dimension of the shared quantum states. In this work, we revisit normalized Bell inequalities together with another family: inefficiency-resistant Bell inequalities. To be inefficiency-resistant, the Bell value must not exceed 1 for any local distribution, including those that can abort. This makes the Bell inequality resistant to the detection loophole, while a normalized Bell inequality is resistant to general local noise. Both these families of Bell inequalities are closely related to communication complexity lower bounds. We show how to derive large violations from any gap between classical and quantum communication complexity, provided the lower bound on classical communication is proven using these lower bound techniques. This leads to inefficiency-resistant violations that can be exponential in the size of the inputs. Finally, we study resistance to noise and inefficiency for these Bell inequalities.",16,['cs'],6
1612.03796,quant-ph,"We conduct the first detailed analysis in quantum information of recently derived operator relations from the study of quantum one-way local operations and classical communications (LOCC). We show how operator structures such as operator systems, operator algebras, and Hilbert C*-modules all naturally arise in this setting, and we make use of these structures to derive new results and new derivations of some established results in the study of LOCC. We also show that perfect distinguishability under one-way LOCC and under arbitrary operations is equivalent for several families of operators that appear jointly in matrix and operator theory and quantum information theory.",16,['math'],6
