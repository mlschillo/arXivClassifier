1306.3270,astro-ph,"We revise the conditions for the physical viability of a cosmological model in which dark matter has bulk viscosity and also interacts with dark energy. We have also included radiation and baryonic matter components; all matter components are represented by perfect fluids, except the dark matter, that is treated as an imperfect fluid. We impose upon the model the condition of a complete cosmological dynamics that results in an either null or negative bulk viscosity, but the latter also disagrees with the Local Second Law of Thermodynamics. The model is also compared with cosmological observations at different redshifts: type Ia supernova, the shift parameter of CMB, the acoustic peak of BAO, and the Hubble parameter H(z). In general, observations consistently point out to a negative value of the bulk viscous coefficient, and in overall the fitting procedure shows no preference for the model over the standard LCDM model.",13,[],1
1307.6712,astro-ph,"We report on photometric observations of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae, MASTER OT J211258.65242145.4 and MASTER OT J203749.39552210.3 which underwent outbursts in 2012. Early superhumps were recorded in both systems. During superoutburst plateau, ordinary superhumps with a period of 0.060291(4) d (MASTER J211258) and of 0.061307(9) d (MASTER J203749) in average were observed. MASTER J211258 and MASTER J203749 exhibited eight and more than four post-superoutburst rebrightenings, respectively. In the final part of the superoutburst, an increase in the superhump periods was seen in both systems. We have made a survey of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae with multiple rebrightenings, and confirmed that the superhump periods of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae with multiple rebrightenings were longer than those of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae without a rebrightening. Although WZ Sge-type dwarf novae with multiple rebrightenings have been thought to be the good candidates for period bouncers based on their low mass ratio (q) from inferred from the period of fully grown (stage B) superhumps, our new method using the period of growing superhumps (stage A superhumps), however, implies higher q than those expected from stage B superhumps. These q values appear to be consistent with the duration of the stage A superoutbursts, which likely reflects the growth time of the 3:1 resonance. We present a working hypothesis that the small fractional superhump excesses for stage B superhumps in these systems may be explained as a result that a higher gas pressure effect works in these systems than in ordinary SU UMa-type dwarf novae. This result leads to a new picture that WZ Sge-type dwarf novae with multiple rebrightenings and SU UMa-type dwarf novae without a rebrightening (they are not period bouncers) are located in the same place on the evolutionary track.",13,[],1
1301.5196,astro-ph,"I adopt a formalism previously developed by Catelan and Theuns (CT) in order to estimate the impact of primordial non-Gaussianity on the quasi-linear spin growth of cold dark matter protostructures. A variety of bispectrum shapes are considered, spanning the currently most popular early Universe models for the occurrence of non-Gaussian density fluctuations. In their original work, CT considered several other shapes, and suggested that only for one of those does the impact of non-Gaussianity seem to be perturbatively tractable. For that model, and on galactic scales, the next-to-linear non-Gaussian contribution to the angular momentum variance has an upper limit of equation with respect to the linear one. I find that all the new models considered in this work can also be seemingly described via perturbation theory. Considering current bounds on equation for inflationary non-Gaussianity leads to the quasi-linear contribution being equation of the linear one. This result motivates the systematic study of higher-order non-Gaussian corrections, in order to attain a comprehensive picture of how structure gravitational dynamics descends from the physics of the primordial Universe.",13,[],1
1312.4926,astro-ph,"Broadband flux measurements centred around [3.6 equationm] and [4.5 equationm] obtained with Spitzer during the occultation of seven extrasolar planets by their host stars have been combined with parallax measurements to compute the absolute magnitudes of these planets. Those measurements are arranged in two colour-magnitude diagrams. Because most of the targets have sizes and temperatures similar to brown dwarfs, they can be compared to one another. In principle, this should permit inferences about exo-atmospheres based on knowledge acquired by decades of observations of field brown dwarfs and ultra-cool stars' atmospheres. Such diagrams can assemble all measurements gathered so far and will provide help in the preparation of new observational programs. In most cases, planets and brown dwarfs follow similar sequences. HD\,2094589b and GJ 436b are found to be outliers, so is the nightside of HD 189733b. The photometric variability associated with the orbital phase of HD 189733b is particularly revealing. The planet exhibits what appears like a spectral type and chemical transition between its day and night sides: HD 189733b straddles the L-T spectral class transition, which would imply different cloud coverage on each hemisphere. Methane absorption could be absent at its hot spot but present over the rest of the planet.",13,[],1
1306.4190,astro-ph,"We have used millisecond pulsars (MSPs) from the southern High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) intermediate latitude survey area to simulate the distribution and total population of MSPs in the Galaxy. Our model makes use of the scale factor method, which estimates the ratio of the total number of MSPs in the Galaxy to the known sample. Using our best fit value for the z-height, z=500 pc, we find an underlying population of MSPs of 8.3( 4.2)*104 sources down to a limiting luminosity of Lmin=0.1 mJy kpc2 and a luminosity distribution with a steep slope of d\log N/d\log L = -1.45( 0.14). However, at the low end of the luminosity distribution, the uncertainties introduced by small number statistics are large. By omitting very low luminosity pulsars, we find a Galactic population above Lmin=0.2 mJy kpc2 of only 3.0( 0.7)*104 MSPs. We have also simulated pulsars with periods shorter than any known MSP, and estimate the maximum number of sub-MSPs in the Galaxy to be 7.8( 5.0)*104 pulsars at L=0.1 mJy kpc2. In addition, we estimate that the high and low latitude parts of the southern HTRU survey will detect 68 and 42 MSPs respectively, including 78 new discoveries. Pulsar luminosity, and hence flux density, is an important input parameter in the model. Some of the published flux densities for the pulsars in our sample do not agree with the observed flux densities from our data set, and we have instead calculated average luminosities from archival data from the Parkes Telescope. We found many luminosities to be very different than their catalogue values, leading to very different population estimates. Large variations in flux density highlight the importance of including scintillation effects in MSP population studies.",13,[],1
1301.0620,astro-ph,"We analyze the present-day structure and assembly history of a high resolution hydrodynamic simulation of the formation of a Milky Way (MW)-like disk galaxy, from the ""Eris"" simulation suite, dissecting it into cohorts of stars formed at different epochs of cosmic history. At z=0, stars with tform < 2 Gyr mainly occupy the stellar spheroid, with the oldest (earliest forming) stars having more centrally concentrated profiles. The younger age cohorts populate disks of progressively longer radial scale length and shorter vertical scale height. At a given radius, the vertical density profiles and velocity dispersions of stars vary smoothly as a function of age, and the superposition of old, vertically-extended and young, vertically-compact cohorts gives rise to a double-exponential profile like that observed in the MW. Turning to formation history, we find that the trends of spatial structure and kinematics with stellar age are largely imprinted at birth, or immediately thereafter. Stars that form during the active merger phase at z>3 are quickly scattered into rounded, kinematically hot configurations. The oldest disk cohorts form in structures that are radially compact and relatively thick, while subsequent cohorts form in progressively larger, thinner, colder configurations from gas with increasing levels of rotational support. The disk thus forms ""inside-out"" in a radial sense and ""upside-down"" in a vertical sense. Secular heating and radial migration influence the final state of each age cohort, but the changes they produce are small compared to the trends established at formation. The predicted correlations of stellar age with spatial and kinematic structure are in good qualitative agreement with the correlations observed for mono-abundance stellar populations in the MW.",13,[],1

1308.1508,astro-ph,"We present rotation periods for thousands of active stars in the Kepler field derived from Q3 data. In most cases a second period close to the rotation period was detected, which we interpreted as surface differential rotation (DR). Active stars were selected from the whole sample using the range of the variability amplitude. To detect different periods in the light curves we used the Lomb-Scargle periodogram in a pre-whitening approach to achieve parameters for a global sine fit. The most dominant periods from the fit were ascribed to different surface rotation periods, but spot evolution could also play a role. Due to the large number of stars the period errors were estimated in a statistical way. We thus cannot exclude the existence of false positives among our periods. In our sample of 40.661 active stars we found 24.124 rotation periods equation between 0.5-45 days. The distribution of stars with 0.5 < B-V < 1.0 and ages derived from angular momentum evolution that are younger than 300 Myr is consistent with a constant star-formation rate. A second period equation within equation% of the rotation period equation was found in 18.619 stars (77.2%). Attributing these two periods to DR we found that the relative shear equation increases with rotation period, and slightly decreases with effective temperature. The absolute shear equation slightly increases between equation K. Above 6000 K equation shows much larger scatter. We found weak dependence of equation on rotation period. Latitudinal differential rotation measured for the first time in more than 18.000 stars provides a comprehensive picture of stellar surface shear, consistent with major predictions from mean-field theory. To what extent our observations are prone to false positives and selection bias is not fully explored, and needs to be addressed using more Kepler data.",13,[],1
1307.3056,astro-ph,"As one of the options, the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) Consortium is considering the possibility to install its Southern array in Chile, in the Atacama Desert. The envisaged site is situated about 5 km from the future European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), which will operate 8 parallel DC lasers emitting at 589.2 nm, to create an artificial 6.8 magnitude star at an altitude of 90 km. The guide stars are used for the adaptive optics of the telescope. Although having the artificial stars in the field-of-view of a CTA telescope would happen rather seldom, and can be avoided by coordinated scheduling, the laser beams may cross the field-of-view of a telescope more frequently and leave spurious light tracks, hence complicating the analysis of the shower images. We derive an approximate formula to estimate the expected number of photons from molecular and aerosol scattering of the laser light beam into the field-of-view of a camera pixel. We then present several specific cases of laser influence on the CTA camera pixels, based on the selected direction of the laser beam, using the expected quantum efficiency of the camera photomultipliers at the given wavelength.",13,[],1
1310.1336,astro-ph,"We have developed an algorithm (x2abundance) to derive the lunar surface chemistry from X-ray fluorescence (XRF) data for the Chandrayaan-1 X-ray Spectrometer (C1XS) experiment. The algorithm converts the observed XRF line fluxes to elemental abundances with uncertainties. We validated the algorithm in the laboratory using high Z elements (20 < Z < 30) published in Athiray et al. (2013). In this paper, we complete the exercise of validation using samples containing low Z elements, which are also analogous to the lunar surface composition (ie., contains major elements between 11 < Z < 30). The paper summarizes results from XRF experiments performed on Lunar simulant (JSC-1A) and anorthosite using a synchrotron beam excitation. We also discuss results from the validation of x2abundance using Monte Carlo simulation (GEANT4 XRF simulation).",13,[],1
1305.5549,astro-ph,"Massive, hot OB-stars show clear evidence of strong macroscopic broadening (in addition to rotation) in their photospheric spectral lines. This paper examines the occurrence of such ""macro-turbulence"" in slowly rotating O-stars with strong, organised surface magnetic fields. Focusing on the CIV 5811A line, we find evidence for significant macro-turbulent broadening in all stars except NGC1624-2, which also has (by far) the strongest magnetic field. Instead, the very sharp CIV lines in NGC1624-2 are dominated by magnetic Zeeman broadening, from which we estimate a dipolar field of approximately 20 kG. By contrast, magnetic broadening is negligible in the other stars (due to their weaker field strengths, on order 1 kG), and their CIV profiles are typically very broad and similar to corresponding lines observed in non-magnetic O-stars. Quantifying this by an isotropic, Gaussian macro-turbulence, we derive vmac = 2.2 (- 0.9/2.2) km/s for NGC1624-2, and vmac = 20-65 km/s for the rest of the magnetic sample. We use these observational results to test the hypothesis that the field can stabilise the atmosphere and suppress the generation of macro-turbulence down to stellar layers where the magnetic pressure PB and the gas pressure Pg are comparable. Using a simple grey atmosphere to estimate the temperature T0 at which PB = Pg, we find that T0 > Teff for all investigated magnetic stars, but that T0 reaches the ~160000 K layers associated with the iron opacity-bump in hot stars only for NGC1624-2. This is consistent with the view that the responsible physical mechanism for photospheric O-star macro-turbulence may be stellar gravity-mode oscillations excited by sub-surface convection zones, and suggests that a sufficiently strong magnetic field can suppress such iron-bump generated convection and associated pulsational excitation.",13,[],1
1307.7026,astro-ph,"We study structure formation in non-minimally coupled dark energy models, where there is a coupling in the Lagrangian between a quintessence scalar field and gravity via the Ricci scalar. We consider models with a range of different non-minimal coupling strengths and compare these to minimally coupled quintessence models with time-dependent dark energy densities. The equations of state of the latter are tuned to either reproduce the equation of state of the non-minimally coupled models or their background history. Thereby they provide a reference to study the unique imprints of coupling on structure formation. We show that the coupling between gravity and the scalar field, which effectively results in a time-varying gravitational constant G, is not negligible and its effect can be distinguished from a minimally coupled model. We extend previous work on this subject by showing that major differences appear in the determination of the mass function at high masses, where we observe differences of the order of 40% at z=0. Our new results concern effects on the non-linear matter power spectrum and on the lensing signal (differences of ~10% for both quantities), where we find that non-minimally coupled models could be distinguished from minimally coupled ones.",13,[],1
1309.4646,astro-ph,We present the first spectropolarimetric radio observations that apply Rotation Measure (RM) Synthesis to interferometric data from the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 610 MHz. Spectropolarimetry requires measurement of a large number of instrumental systematics so that their effects can be calibrated - a technical problem that is currently being faced by the upcoming SKA pathfinders. Our fully-calibrated data allow for the peak Faraday depth and polarisation fraction to be measured for sub-mJy compact sources in the field of M51 at 610 MHz. The diffuse extended emission in the interacting galaxy pair is shown to be depolarised below the sensitivity limit. A survey of linear polarisation with the GMRT is now feasible and could be used to place constraints on the prevailing depolarisation mechanisms at low frequencies - improving polarised source count estimates and constraining the RM-grid observable with next generation facilities such as the SKA.,13,[],1
1310.0824,astro-ph,"We present early results from a Hubble Space Telescope survey of the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. These Milky Way satellites were discovered in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and appear to be an extension of the classical dwarf spheroidals to low luminosities, offering a new front in the efforts to understand the missing satellite problem. Because they are the least luminous, most dark matter dominated, and least chemically evolved galaxies known, the ultra-faint dwarfs are the best candidate fossils from the early universe. The primary goal of the survey is to measure the star-formation histories of these galaxies and discern any synchronization due to the reionization of the universe. We find that the six galaxies of our survey have very similar star-formation histories, and that each is dominated by stars older than 12 Gyr.",13,[],1
1302.7253,astro-ph,"We quantify the effects of magnetic fields, cosmic rays and gas pressure on the rotational velocity of HI gas in the Milky Way, at galactic distances between Rsun and 2Rsun. The magnetic field is modelled by two components; a mainly azimuthal magnetic component and a small-scale tangled field. We construct a range of plausible axisymmetric models consistent with the strength of the total magnetic field as inferred from radio synchrotron data. In a realistic Galactic disk, the pressure by turbulent motions, cosmic rays and the tangled turbulent field provide radial support to the disk. Large-scale (ordered) magnetic fields may or may not provide support to the disk, depending on the local radial gradient of the azimuthal field. We show that for observationally constrained models, magnetic forces cannot appreciably alter the tangential velocity of HI gas within a galactic distance of 2Rsun.",13,[],1

1307.5092,astro-ph,"The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is the next generation of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes. It will reach a sensitivity and an energy resolution with no precendent in very high energy gamma-ray astronomy. In order to achieve this goal, the systematic uncertainties derived from the atmospheric conditions shall be reduced to the minimum. Different instruments may help account for these uncertainties. The Barcelona IFAE/UAB (acronyms for Institut de F\'isica d'Altes Energies and Universitat Aut\`onoma de Barcelona, respectively) and the Montpellier LUPM (Laboratoire Univers et Particules de Montpellier) groups are building Raman LIDARs, devices which can reduce the systematic uncertainties in the reconstruction of the gamma-ray energies from 20equation down to 5equation. The Raman LIDARs subject of this work have coaxial 1.8 m mirrors with a Nd-YAG laser each. A liquid light-guide collects the light at the focal plane and transports it to the readout system. We are developping a monochromator with the purpose of testing the readout chain of both LIDARs. This device is composed of a system of filters and a photomultiplier, and will be used to study a particular elastic channel. After characterizing the system, we will build a polychromator to collect also the sparse Raman signal and will optimize it to reduce every possible loss of signal. We report on the current status of the LIDARs development and also the latest results on the different characterization tests.",13,[],1
1311.3246,astro-ph,"Precision modeling of M dwarfs has become worthwhile in recent years due to the increasingly precise values of masses and radii which can be obtained from eclipsing binary studies. Torres (2013) has identified 4 prime M dwarf pairs with the most precise empirical determinations of masses and radii. The measured radii are consistently larger than standard stellar models predict. We have previously modeled M dwarfs in the context of a criterion due to Gough & Tayler in which magnetic fields inhibit the onset of convection according to a physics-based prescription. New constraints on the models of M dwarfs are now provided by measurements of lithium abundances. The key aspect of Li in terms of setting constraints on magnetic modeling is that Li burning starts at T = 2.5 MK, and temperatures of just such magnitude are associated with the base of the convection zone: magnetic inhibition of convective onset can shift this base slightly closer to the surface, i.e. to slightly lower temperatures, thereby reducing the amount of Li depletion compared to a non-magnetic model. In the present paper, we consider how our magneto-convection models handle the new test of stellar structure provided by Li measurements. Among the prime systems listed by Torres, we find that plausible magnetic models work well for CM Dra and YY Gem but not for CU Cnc. (The fourth system in Torres's list does not yet have enough information to warrant magnetic modeling.) For CU Cnc, we suggest that the observed lithium may have been accreted from a circumstellar disk. We find that our magneto-convection models of CM Dra, YY Gem and CU Cnc yield results which are consistent with the observed correlation between magnetic flux and X-ray luminosity.",13,[],1
1303.7399,astro-ph,"The stacked spectral energy distribution (SED) of Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) 24equation detected Lyman break galaxies (MIPS-LBGs) is fitted by means of spectro-photometric model GRASIL with an ""educated"" fitting approach which benefits from results of chemical evolution models. The star formation rate(SFR)-age-metallicity degeneracies of SED modelling are broken by using SFH and chemical enrichment history suggested by chemical models, which also provide dust mass, dust abundance and chemical elements locked in dust component. We derive the total mass equation, stellar mass equation, gas mass equation, dust mass equation, age and SFR of the stacked MIPS-LBG in a self-consistent way. Our estimate of equation agrees with other works based on UV-optical SED fitting. We suggest that MIPS-LBGs at equation are young (0.3-0.6 Gyr), massive (equation), dusty (equation), metal rich (equation) progenitors of elliptical galaxies suffering a strong burst of star formation (SFR equation). Our estimate of equation of the stacked MIPS-LBG is about a factor of eight lower than the estimated value based on single temperature grey-body fitting, suggesting that self-consistent SED models are needed to estimate dust mass. By comparing with the Milky Way molecular cloud and dust properties, we suggest that denser and dustier environments and flatter dust size distribution are likely in high redshift massive star forming galaxies. These dust properties, as well as the different types of SFHs, can cause different SED shapes between high redshift star-forming ellipticals and local star-burst templates. This discrepancy of SED shapes could in turn explain the non detection at submillimeter wavelengths, of IR luminous (equation) MIPS-LBGs.",13,[],1
1306.2424,astro-ph,"We present evidence for stochastic star formation histories in low-mass (M* < 1010 Msun) galaxies from observations within the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. For ~73,000 galaxies between 0.05<z<0.32, we calculate star formation rates (SFR) and specific star formation rates (SSFR = SFR/M*) from spectroscopic Halpha measurements and apply dust corrections derived from Balmer decrements. We find a dependence of SSFR on stellar mass, such that SSFRs decrease with increasing stellar mass for star-forming galaxies, and for the full sample, SSFRs decrease as a stronger function of stellar mass. We use simple parametrizations of exponentially declining star formation histories to investigate the dependence on stellar mass of the star formation timescale and the formation redshift. We find that parametrizations previously fit to samples of z~1 galaxies cannot recover the distributions of SSFRs and stellar masses observed in the GAMA sample between 0.05<z<0.32. In particular, a large number of low-mass (M* < 1010 Msun) galaxies are observed to have much higher SSFRs than can be explained by these simple models over the redshift range of 0.05<z<0.32, even when invoking mass-dependent staged evolution. For such a large number of galaxies to maintain low stellar masses, yet harbour such high SSFRs, requires the late onset of a weak underlying exponentially declining SFH with stochastic bursts of star formation superimposed.",13,[],1

Observationally, many short-period sdB systems are indeed known. The predicted long period peak is missing and orbits have only been determined for a few long-period systems. As these predictions are based on poorly understood binary-interaction processes, it is of prime importance to confront the predictions to well-constrained observational data. We therefore initiated a monitoring program to find and characterize long-period sdB stars with the 1.2 m Mercator telescope. Here we present the results of this program.",13,[],1
1304.2567,astro-ph,"The discrepancies in the results produced by the two most commonly used Monte Carlo programs for simulation of propagation of ultra-high energy cosmic ray photons in the presence of the geomagnetic field are presented. Although photons have not yet been discovered in the cosmic ray flux at highest energies, the capabilities of the present cosmic ray detectors make their discovery possible, according to the predictions of conventional models, within the next few years. It is therefore necessary to have a reliable and well maintained software for relevant simulations. The results of this paper are important for simulations of propagation of photons at energies above 1019 eV. Photons of such high energies might interact with the geomagnetic field giving rise to a cascade of particles even above the atmosphere. This effect is called a ""preshower effect"". The preshower effect is important for air shower evolution and has to be accounted for in full Monte Carlo simulations of propagation of highest energy cosmic-ray photons.

This program is spread out over a range of astrophysical targets which can potentially yield definitive signatures of neutralino self-annihilation such as dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and the center of the Milky Way galaxy. While the program is still in progress, initial results on dSphs have produced very competitive upper limits on the thermally averaged cross-section of neutralino self-annihilation as well as strongly constraining leptophillic dark matter models (such as those inferred from the PAMELA and AMS positron fraction results). As the program continues over the next 5 years, VERITAS observations will yield some of the strongest constraints available from IACTs, pushing down the limit on the thermally averaged cross-section of neutralino self-annihilation to the expected natural thermal relic scale.",13,[],1
1305.0724,astro-ph,"Insight into a number of interesting questions in cosmology can be obtained from the first crossing distributions of physically motivated barriers by random walks with correlated steps. We write the first crossing distribution as a formal series, ordered by the number of times a walk upcrosses the barrier. Since the fraction of walks with many upcrossings is negligible if the walk has not taken many steps, the leading order term in this series is the most relevant for understanding the massive objects of most interest in cosmology. This first term only requires knowledge of the bivariate distribution of the walk height and slope, and provides an excellent approximation to the first crossing distribution for all barriers and smoothing filters of current interest. We show that this simplicity survives when extending the approach to the case of non-Gaussian random fields. For non-Gaussian fields which are obtained by deterministic transformations of a Gaussian, the first crossing distribution is simply related to that for Gaussian walks crossing a suitably rescaled barrier. Our analysis shows that this is a useful way to think of the generic case as well. Although our study is motivated by the possibility that the primordial fluctuation field was non-Gaussian, our results are general. In particular, they do not assume the non-Gaussianity is small, so they may be viewed as the solution to an excursion set analysis of the late-time, nonlinear fluctuation field rather than the initial one. They are also useful for models in which the barrier height is determined by quantities other than the initial density, since most other physically motivated variables (such as the shear) are usually stochastic and non-Gaussian. We use the Lognormal transformation to illustrate some of our arguments.",13,[],1
1302.3003,astro-ph,"It has been suggested that merging plays an important role in the formation and the evolution of elliptical galaxies(EGs). In order to understand the past merging history of EGs, we studied the optical-NIR color gradients of 204 EGs. The use of the optical and the NIR data provides large wavelength baselines, and breaks the age-metallicity(Z) degeneracy, allowing us to derive age and Z gradients. The use of the deep SDSS Stripe 82 images make it possible for us to examine how the color/age/Z gradients are related to merging features. We find that the optical-NIR color and the age/Z gradients of EGs with tidal features are consistent with those of relaxed EGs suggesting that the two populations underwent a similar merging history on average and that mixing of stars was more or less completed before the tidal features disappear. EGs with dust features have steeper color gradients than the other two types, even after masking out dust features during the analysis, which can be due to a process involving wet merging. More importantly, we find that the scatter in the color/age/Z gradients of the relaxed and merging feature types, decreases as their luminosities increase at M > 1011.4 M\odot but stays to be large at lower luminosities. Mean Z gradients appear nearly constant over the explored mass range, but a possible flattening is observed at the massive end. According to our toy model that predicts how the distribution of Z gradients changes as a result of major dry merging, the mean Z gradient should flatten by 40% and its scatter become smaller by 80% per a mass doubling scale if EGs evolve only through major dry merger. Our result, although limited by a number statistics at the massive end, is consistent with the picture that major dry merging is an important mechanism for the evolution for EGs at M > 1011.4 M\odot, but less important at the lower mass range.",13,[],1

1308.6204,astro-ph,"We present results from 3D visco-resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the emergence of a convection zone magnetic flux tube into a solar atmosphere containing a pre-existing dipole coronal field, which is orientated to minimize reconnection with the emerging field. We observe that the emergence process is capable of producing a coronal flux rope by the transfer of twist from the convection zone as found in previous simulations. We find that this flux rope is stable, with no evidence of a fast rise, and that its ultimate height in the corona is determined by the strength of the pre-existing dipole field. We also find that although the electric currents in the initial convection zone flux tube are almost perfectly neutralized, the resultant coronal flux rope carries a significant net current. These results suggest that flux tube emergence is capable of creating non-current-neutralized stable flux ropes in the corona, tethered by overlying potential fields, a magnetic configuration that is believed to be the source of coronal mass ejections.",13,[],1
1308.3412,astro-ph,"We compile the first comprehensive census of hot luminous stars in the 30 Doradus (30 Dor) star forming region of the LMC. The census extends to a radius of 10arcmin (150pc) from the central cluster, R136. Stars were selected photometrically and combined with the latest spectral types. 1145 candidate hot luminous stars were identified of which >700 were considered genuine early type stars that contribute to feedback. We assess the spectroscopic completeness to be 85% in outer regions (>5pc) but fall to 35% in the vicinity of R136, giving a total of 500 hot luminous stars with spectroscopy. Stellar calibrations and models were used to obtain their physical parameters before integrated values were compared to global observations and the population synthesis code, Starburst99. The 31 W-R and Of/WN stars made large contributions to the total ionising and wind luminosities of ~40% and ~50%, respectively. Stars with Minit>100Msun also showed high contributions to the global feedback, ~25% in both cases. Such massive stars are not accounted for by the current Starburst99 code, which underestimated the ionising and wind luminosities of R136 by factors of ~2 and ~9, respectively. The census inferred a SFR of 0.073/-0.04Msun/yr for 30 Dor, typically higher than results from popular SFR calibrations. However, it remained consistent with a far-UV luminosity tracer and a combined Halpha and mid-infrared tracer, but only after correcting for Halpha extinction. The global ionising output exceeded measurements from the associated gas and dust, suggesting ~6(55/-6)% of ionising photons escape the region. When studying very luminous star forming regions, it is therefore essential to include the most massive stars to ensure a reliable energy budget. If 30 Dor is typical of other large star forming regions, estimates of the SFR will be underpredicted if this escape fraction is not accounted for.(abridged)",13,[],1
1311.5514,astro-ph,"We present NuSTAR observations of Vela X-1, a persistent, yet highly variable, neutron star high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB). Two observations were taken at similar orbital phases but separated by nearly a year. They show very different 3-79 keV flux levels as well as strong variability during each observation, covering almost one order of magnitude in flux. These observations allow, for the first time ever, investigations on kilo-second time-scales of how the centroid energies of cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) depend on flux for a persistent HMXB. We find that the line energy of the harmonic CRSF is correlated with flux, as expected in the sub-critical accretion regime. We argue that Vela X-1 has a very narrow accretion column with a radius of around 0.4 km that sustains a Coulomb interaction dominated shock at the observed luminosities of Lx ~ 3x1036 erg/s. Besides the prominent harmonic line at 55 keV the fundamental line around 25 keV is clearly detected. We find that the strengths of the two CRSFs are anti-correlated, which we explain by photon spawning. This anti-correlation is a possible explanation for the debate about the existence of the fundamental line. The ratio of the line energies is variable with time and deviates significantly from 2.0, also a possible consequence of photon spawning, which changes the shape of the line. During the second observation, Vela X-1 showed a short off-state in which the power-law softened and a cut-off was no longer measurable. It is likely that the source switched to a different accretion regime at these low mass accretion rates, explaining the drastic change in spectral shape.",13,[],1
1310.5048,astro-ph,"Observations of exoplanets over the last two decades have revealed a new class of Jupiter-size planets with orbital periods of a few days, the so-called ""hot Jupiters"". Recent measurements using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect have shown that many (~ 50%) of these planets are misaligned; furthermore, some (~ 15%) are even retrograde with respect to the stellar spin axis. Motivated by these observations, we explore the possibility of forming retrograde orbits in hierarchical triple configurations consisting of a star-planet inner pair with another giant planet, or brown dwarf, in a much wider orbit. Recently Naoz et al. (2011) showed that in such a system, the inner planet's orbit can flip back and forth from prograde to retrograde, and can also reach extremely high eccentricities. Here we map a significant part of the parameter space of dynamical outcomes for these systems. We derive strong constraints on the orbital configurations for the outer perturber that could lead to the formation of hot Jupiters with misaligned or retrograde orbits. We focus only on the secular evolution, neglecting other dynamical effects such as mean-motion resonances, as well as all dissipative forces. For example, with an inner Jupiter-like planet initially on a nearly circular orbit at 5 AU, we show that a misaligned hot Jupiter is likely to be formed in the presence of a more massive planetary companion (> 2 MJ) within 140 AU of the inner system, with mutual inclination 50 degrees and eccentricity above 0.25. This is in striking contrast to the test-particle approximation, where an almost perpendicular configuration can still cause large eccentricity excitations, but flips of an inner Jupiter-like planet are much less likely to occur. The constraints we derive can be used to guide future observations, and, in particular, searches for more distant companions in systems containing a hot Jupiter.",13,[],1

1305.5842,astro-ph,"ABRIDGED: We have used the LABOCA Survey of the ECDF-S (LESS) to investigate rest-frame FIR emission from typical SF systems (LBGs) at redshift 3, 4, and 5. We initially concentrate on LBGs at z~3 and select three subsamples on stellar mass, extinction corrected SF and rest-frame UV-magnitude. We produce composite 870micron images of the typical source in our subsamples, obtaining ~4sigma detections and suggesting a correlation between FIR luminosity and stellar mass. We apply a similar procedure to our full samples at z~3, 4, 4.5 and 5 and do not obtain detections - consistent with a simple scaling between FIR luminosity and stellar mass. In order to constrain the FIR SED of these systems we explore their emission at multiple wavelengths spanning the peak of dust emission at z~3 using the Herschel SPIRE observations of the field. We obtain detections at multiple wavelengths for both our stellar mass and UV-magnitude selected samples, and find a best-fit SED with Tdust in the ~33-41K range. We calculate LFIR, obscured SFRs and Mdust, and find that a significant fraction of SF in these systems is obscured. Interestingly, our extinction corrected SFR sample does not display the large FIR fluxes predicted from its red UV-spectral slope. This suggests that the method of assuming an intrinsic UV-slope and correcting for dust attenuation may be invalid for this sample - and that these are not in fact the most actively SF systems. All of our z~3 samples fall on the `main sequence' of SF galaxies at z~3 and our detected subsamples are likely to represent the high obscuration end of LBGs at their epoch. We compare the FIR properties of our subsamples with various other populations, finding that our stellar mass selected sample shows similar FIR characteristics to SMGs at the same epoch and therefore potentially represents the low LFIR end of the high redshift FIR luminosity function.",13,[],1

The time of peak in the STEREO passband has been constrained to within 4 hours, as a result of the high cadence data obtained by STEREO/HI.

We analyze 21 cm HI absorption spectra towards the complex to constrain their kinematic distances. PN G035.5-00.4 has a distance from 3.8/-0.4 kpc to 5.4/-0.7 kpc. IRAS 185510159 is at 4.3/-0.5 kpc.

The new distance of SNR G35.6-0.4 and the derived mass for the ~55 km/s CO molecular cloud can accommodate an association with HESS J1858020.

1301.5940,astro-ph,"We observed the pulsar PSR J1648-4611 with Suzaku. Two X-ray sources, Suzaku J1648-4610 (Src A) and Suzaku J1648-4615 (Src B), were found in the field of view. Src A is coincident with the pulsar PSR J1648-4611, which was also detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. A hard-band image indicates that Src A is spatially extended. We found point sources in the vicinity of Src A by using a Chandra image of the same region, but the point sources have soft X-ray emission and cannot explain the hard X-ray emission of Src A. The hard-band spectrum of Src A can be reproduced by a power-law model with a photon index of 2.00.9-0.7. The X-ray flux in the 2-10 keV band is 1.4 \times 10-13 erg cm-2 s-1. The diffuse emission suggests a pulsar wind nebula around PSR J1648-4611, but the luminosity of Src A is much larger than that expected from the spin-down luminosity of the pulsar. Parts of the very-high-energy gamma-ray emission of HESS J1646-458 may be powered by this pulsar wind nebula driven by PSR J1648-4611. Src B has soft emission, and its X-ray spectrum can be described by a power-law model with a photon index of 3.01.4-0.8. The X-ray flux in the 0.4-10 keV band is 6.4 \times 10-14 erg s-1 cm-2.

1304.3782,astro-ph,"We have conducted a near-infrared monitoring campaign at the UK InfraRed Telescope (UKIRT), of the Local Group spiral galaxy M33 (Triangulum). The main aim was to identify stars in the very final stage of their evolution, and for which the luminosity is more directly related to the birth mass than the more numerous less-evolved giant stars that continue to increase in luminosity. In this third paper of the series, we measure the dust production and rates of mass loss by the pulsating Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and red supergiants. To this aim, we combined our time-averaged near-IR photometry with the multi-epoch mid-IR photometry obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The mass-loss rates are seen to increase with increasing strength of pulsation and with increasing bolometric luminosity. Low-mass stars lose most of their mass through stellar winds, but even super-AGB stars and red supergiants lose equation% of their mass via a dusty stellar wind. More than three-quarters of the dust return is oxygenous. We construct a 2-D map of the mass-return rate, showing a radial decline but also local enhancements due to agglomerations of massive stars. We estimate a total mass-loss rate of 0.004--0.005 Mequation yrequation kpcequation, increasing to equation Mequation yrequation kpcequation when accounting for eruptive mass loss (e.g., supernov\ae); comparing this to the current star formation rate of equation Mequation yrequation kpcequation we conclude that star formation in the central region of M\,33 can only be sustained if gas is accreted from further out in the disc or from circum-galactic regions.",13,[],1

We present a new web application for calculating the HMF -- the frontend HMFcalc and the engine hmf. HMFcalc has been designed to be flexible, efficient and easy to use, providing observational and theoretical astronomers alike with the means to explore standard functional forms of the HMF or to tailor their own.

1310.2480,astro-ph,"The evolution of a dilute electron-positron fireball is calculated in the regime of strong magnetization and very high compactness (l ~103-108). Heating is applied at a low effective temperature (< 25 keV), and the fireball is allowed to expand, so that the formation of a black-body spectral distribution is inhibited by pair annihilation. The diffusion equation for Compton scattering is coupled to a single-temperature pair gas and an exact (trans-relativistic) cyclo-synchrotron photon source. We find that the photon spectrum develops a quasi-thermal peak, with a power-law slope below it that is characteristic of gamma-ray bursts. The formation of a thermal high-frequency spectrum is checked using the full kinetic equations at l ~ 103. These results have several implications for the central engine of GRBs, and the mechanism of energy transport. 1. Baryon rest mass carries less than ~ 10-5 of the energy flux at jet breakout inside ~ 1012 cm from the engine, with most carried by the magnetic field. 2. This degree of baryon purity points to the presence of an event horizon in the engine, and neutrons play a negligible role in the prompt emission mechanism. 3. X-ray flashes are emitted by outflows carrying enough baryons that the photosphere is pair-depleted, which we show results in faster thermalization. 4. The relation between observed peak frequency and burst luminosity is bounded below by the observed Amati et al. relation if jet Lorentz factor ~ 1/(opening angle) at breakout. 5. Stellar models are used to demonstrate an inconsistency between the highest observed GRB energies, and a hydrodynamic nozzle: magnetic collimation is required. 6. The magnetized pair gas is dilute enough that high-frequency Alfven waves may become charge starved. Finally, we suggest that limitations on magnetic reconnection from plasma collisionality have been overestimated.",13,[],1
1305.4634,astro-ph,"The centers of most known galaxies host supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In orbit around these black holes are a centrally-concentrated distribution of stars, both in single and in binary systems. Occasionally, these stars are perturbed onto orbits that bring them close to the SMBH. If the star is in a binary system, the three-body interaction with the SMBH can lead to large changes in orbital energy, depositing one of the two stars on a tightly-bound orbit, and its companion into a hyperbolic orbit that may escape the galaxy. In this Letter, we show that the disruption of solitary stars can also lead to large positive increases in orbital energy. The kick velocity depends on the amount of mass the star loses at pericenter, but not on the ratio of black hole to stellar mass, and are at most the star's own escape velocity. We find that these kicks are usually too small to result in the ejection of stars from the Milky Way, but can eject the stars from the black hole's sphere of influence, reducing their probability of being disrupted again. We estimate that ~105 stars, ~1% of all stars within 10 pc of the galactic center, are likely to have had mass removed by the central black hole through tidal interaction, and speculate that these ""turbovelocity"" stars will at first be redder, but eventually bluer, and always brighter than their unharrassed peers.",13,[],1

We derive jet parameters for DG Tau A and find an initial jet opening angle of 86 degrees within 2 au of the source, a mass-loss rate of 1.5x10-8 solar masses/yr for the ionised component of the jet, and the total ejection/accretion ratio to range from 0.06-0.3.

1304.7681,astro-ph,"We develop a method for reconstructing the two-dimensional, projected gravitational potential of galaxy clusters from observed line-of-sight velocity dispersions of cluster galaxies. It is the third of an intended series of papers aiming at a unique reconstruction method for cluster potentials combining lensing, X-ray, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and kinematic data. The observed galaxy velocity dispersions are deprojected using the Richardson-Lucy algorithm. The obtained radial velocity dispersions are then related to the gravitational potential by using the tested assumption of a polytropic relation between the effective galaxy pressure and the density. Once the gravitational potential is obtained in three dimensions, projection along the line-of-sight yields the two-dimensional potential. For simplicity we adopt spherical symmetry and a known profile for the anisotropy parameter of the galaxy velocity dispersions. We test the method with a numerically simulated galaxy cluster and galaxies identified therein. We extract a projected velocity-dispersion profile from the simulated cluster and pass it through our algorithm, showing that the deviation between the true and the reconstructed gravitational potential is less then 10% within approximately 1.2 Mpc/h from the cluster centre.",13,[],1

They are especially important for the formation of low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), which are not only formed 100 times more efficiently than in the field, but also have a puzzling dependence on metallicity. In this contribution we review how compact objects are formed and retained, the mechanisms of dynamical formation and the specifics of the evolution of mass-transferring binaries with neutron stars and black holes in globular clusters - those two kinds of compact objects have different favored paths to become luminous in X-ray.

In the defocused dataset, equation appears correlated with equation and equation and anticorrelated with equation and equation, while in the focused dataset we measure no variability for equation at the level of our photometric precision, likely due to evolving weather phenomena. In our focused T0.5 component lightcurve, the equation band lightcurve displays a significant phase offset relative to both equation and equation.

1311.4562,astro-ph,"We revisit the alignments of the largest structures observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) using the seven and nine-year WMAP and first-year Planck data releases. The observed alignments -- the quadrupole with the octopole and their joint alignment with the direction of our motion with respect to the CMB (the dipole direction) and the geometry of the Solar System (defined by the Ecliptic plane) -- are generally in good agreement with results from the previous WMAP data releases. However, a closer look at full-sky data on the largest scales reveals discrepancies between the earlier WMAP data releases (three to seven-year) and the final nine-year release. There are also discrepancies between all the WMAP data releases and the first-year Planck release. Nevertheless, both the WMAP and Planck data confirm the alignments of the largest observable CMB modes in the Universe. In particular, the p-values for the mutual alignment between the quadrupole and octopole, and the alignment of the plane defined by the two with the dipole direction, are both at the greater than 3-sigma level for all three Planck maps studied.

An image treatment has been devised to account for the camera dark current and flat field, using IRAF routines. A study of the observational conditions upon the final outcome was made. The mean temperature at the observation is shown as the most influential parameter upon the final result. Next to it also the temperature variation, the Fried's factor, and the standard deviation of the reflected parabola presented a minor and complex degree of influence. The derived corrections are of the order of hundredths of arc seconds, thus being tenfold smaller than the typical error of one observation. The mean semidiameter for the time lapse (1998-2000) is found as 959"".1070"".006. Through the use of a CLEAN algorithm the periodic terms of the semi diameter were obtained.

We detect vibrationally excited HC3N and HNC, with Tvib 300K. Molecular excitation is consistent with a layered temperature structure, with three main components at 80, 160 and 300 K. For the hot component we estimate a source size of less than 5 pc. The nuclear molecular gas surface density of 1e4 Msun pc-2 is extremely high, and similar to that found in the ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) Arp220. Our observations confirm the the presence of a molecular and atomic in-flow, previously suggested by Herschel observations, which is feeding the activity in the center of NGC4418. Molecular excitation confirms the presence of a very compact, hot dusty core. If a starburst is responsible for the observed IR flux, this has to be at least as extreme as the one in Arp220, with an age of 3-10 Myr and a star formation rate >10 Msun yr-1. If an AGN is present, it must be extremely Compton-thick.",13,[],1
1306.1518,astro-ph,"Earlier work has raised the potential importance of nebular emission in the derivation of the physical characteristics of high redshift Lyman break galaxies. Within certain redshift ranges, and especially at z ~ 6-7, such lines may be strong enough to reduce estimates of the stellar masses and ages of galaxies compared those derived assuming broad-band photometry represents stellar light alone. To test this hypothesis at the highest redshifts where such lines can be probed with ground-based facilities, we examine the near-infrared spectra of a representative sample of 20 3.0 < z < 3.8 Lyman break galaxies using the newly-commissioned MOSFIRE near-infrared spectrograph at the Keck I telescope. We use this data to derive the rest-frame equivalent widths (EW) of [O III] emission and show that these are comparable to estimates derived using the SED fitting technique introduced for sources of known redshift by Stark et al (2013). Although our current sample is modest, its [O III] EW distribution is consistent with that inferred for H\alpha\ based on SED fitting of Stark et al's larger sample of 3.8 < z < 5 galaxies. For a subset of survey galaxies, we use the combination of optical and near-infrared spectroscopy to quantify kinematics of outflows in z ~ 3.5 star-forming galaxies, and discuss the implications for reionization measurements. The trends we uncover underline the dangers of relying purely on broad-band photometry to estimate the physical properties of high redshift galaxies and emphasize the important role of diagnostic spectroscopy.",13,[],1
1303.4409,astro-ph,"We present measurements of the stellar mass functions (SMFs) of star-forming and quiescent galaxies to z = 4 using a sample of 95 675 galaxies in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field. Sources have been selected from the DR1 UltraVISTA Ks-band imaging which covers a unique combination of a wide area (1.62 deg2), to a significant depth (Ks,tot = 23.4). The SMFs of the combined population are in good agreement with previous measurements and show that the stellar mass density of the universe was only 50%, 10% and 1% of its current value at z ~ 0.75, 2.0, and 3.5, respectively. The quiescent population drives most of the overall growth, with the stellar mass density of these galaxies increasing by 2.710.93-0.22 dex since z = 3.5. At z > 2.5, star-forming galaxies dominate the total SMF at all stellar masses, although a nonzero population of quiescent galaxies persists to z = 4. Comparisons of the Ks-selected star-forming galaxy SMFs to UV-selected SMFs at 2.5 < z < 4 show reasonable agreement and suggests UV-selected samples are representative of the majority of the stellar mass density at z > 3.5. We estimate the average mass growth of individual galaxies by selecting galaxies at fixed cumulative number density. The average galaxy with Log(M*/Msun) = 11.5 at z = 0.3 has grown in mass by only 0.2 dex (0.3 dex) since z = 2.0(3.5), whereas those with Log(M*/Msun) = 10.5 have grown by > 1.0 dex since z = 2. At z < 2, the time derivatives of the mass growth are always larger for lower-mass galaxies, which demonstrates that the mass growth in galaxies since that redshift is mass-dependent and primarily bottom-up. Lastly, we examine potential sources of systematic uncertainties on the SMFs and find that those from photo-z templates, SPS modeling, and the definition of quiescent galaxies dominate the total error budget in the SMFs.",13,[],1
1310.6493,astro-ph,"Low and intermediate frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in black hole candidates are believed to be due to oscillations of the Comptonizing regions in an accretion flow. Assuming that the general structure of an accretion disk is a Two Component Advective Flow (TCAF), we numerically simulate the light curves emitted from an accretion disk for different accretion rates and find how the QPO frequencies vary. We use a standard Keplerian disk residing at the equatorial plane as a source of soft photons. These soft photons, after suffering multiple scattering with the hot electrons of the low angular momentum, sub-Keplerian, flow emerge out as hard radiation. The hydrodynamic and thermal properties of the electron cloud is simulated using a Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) code. The TVD code is then coupled with a radiative transfer code which simulates the energy exchange between the electron and radiation using Monte Carlo technique. The resulting localized heating and cooling are included also. We find that the QPO frequency increases and the spectrum becomes softer as we increase the Keplerian disk rate. However, the spectrum becomes harder if we increase the sub-Keplerian accretion rate. We find that an earlier prediction that QPOs occur when the infall time scale roughly matches with the cooling time scale, originally obtained using a power-law cooling, remains valid even for Compton cooling. Our findings agree with the general observations of low frequency QPOs in black hole candidates.",13,[],1
1308.4402,astro-ph,"We perform numerical integrations of four-body (star, planet, planet, satellite) systems to investigate the stability of satellites in planetary Systems with Tightly-packed Inner Planets (STIPs). We find that the majority of closely-spaced stable two-planet systems can stably support satellites across a range of parameter-space which is only slightly decreased compared to that seen for the single-planet case. In particular, circular prograde satellites remain stable out to equation (where equation is the Hill Radius) as opposed to equation in the single-planet case. A similarly small restriction in the stable parameter-space for retrograde satellites is observed, where planetary close approaches in the range 2.5 to 4.5 mutual Hill radii destabilize most satellites orbits only if equation. In very close planetary pairs (e.g. the 12:11 resonance) the addition of a satellite frequently destabilizes the entire system, causing extreme close-approaches and the loss of satellites over a range of circumplanetary semi-major axes. The majority of systems investigated stably harbored satellites over a wide parameter-space, suggesting that STIPs can generally offer a dynamically stable home for satellites, albeit with a slightly smaller stable parameter-space than the single-planet case. As we demonstrate that multi-planet systems are not a priori poor candidates for hosting satellites, future measurements of satellite occurrence rates in multi-planet systems versus single-planet systems could be used to constrain either satellite formation or past periods of strong dynamical interaction between planets.",13,[],1

Using a model for the double flow established in the polar region of a rotating black hole, we study the interplay between the different processes that can power the outflow.

1309.6206,astro-ph,"We study the physical properties and molecular excitation of the different warm gas components found in the protoplanetary nebula CRL 618. We revise our previous Herschel/HIFI observations, which consist of several 12CO and 13CO lines in the far-infrared/sub-mm band. These data have been re-analyzed in detail by improving calibration, the signal-to-noise-ratio, and baseline substraction. We identify the contributions of the different nebular components to the line profiles. We have used a spatio-kinematical model to better constrain the temperature, density, and kinematics of the molecular components probed by the improved CO observations. The 12CO and 13CO J=16-15, J=10-9, and J=6-5 transitions are detected in this source. The line profiles present a composite structure showing spectacular wings in some cases, which become dominant as the energy level increases. Our analysis of the high-energy CO emission with the already known low-energy J=2-1 and J=1-0 lines confirms that the high-velocity component, or fast bipolar outflow, is hotter than previously estimated with a typical temperature of ~300 K. This component may then be an example of a very recent acceleration of the gas by shocks that has not yet cooled down. We also find that the dense central core is characterized by a very low expansion velocity, ~5 km/s, and a strong velocity gradient. We conclude that this component is very likely to be the unaltered circumstellar layers that are lost in the last AGB phase, where the ejection velocity is particularly low. The physical properties of the other two nebular components, the diffuse halo and the double empty shell, more or less agrees with the estimations derived in previous models.",13,[],1
1310.1263,astro-ph,"We argue that the excess of sub-PeV/PeV neutrinos recently reported by IceCube could plausibly originate through pion-production processes in the same sources responsible for cosmic rays (CRs) with energy above the second knee around equationeV. The pion production efficiency for escaping CRs that produce PeV neutrinos is required to be equation in such sources. On the basis of current data, we identify semi-relativistic hypernova remants as possible sources that satisfy the requirements. By virtue of their fast ejecta, such objects can accelerate protons to EeV energies, which in turn can interact with the dense surrounding medium during propagation in their host galaxies to produce sufficient high-energy neutrinos via proton--proton (equation) collisions. Their accompanying gamma ray flux can remain below the diffuse isotropic gamma ray background observed by the \it Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). In order to test this scenario and discriminate from alternatives, the density of target protons/nuclei and the residence time of CRs in the interacting region are crucial uncertainties that need to be clarified. As long as the neutrinos and EeV CRs originate from the same source class, detection of equationPeV neutrinos may be expected within 5-10 years' operation of IceCube. Together with further observations in the PeV range, the neutrinos can help in revealing the currently unknown sources of EeV CRs.",13,[],1
1310.2949,astro-ph,"We report analysis of transit spectroscopy of the extrasolar planets WASP-12 b, WASP-17 b, and WASP-19 b using the Wide Field Camera 3 on the HST. We analyze the data for a single transit for each planet using a strategy similar in certain aspects to the techniques used by Berta et al. (2012), but we extend their methodology to allow us to correct for channel- or wavelength-dependent instrumental effects by utilizing the band-integrated time series and measurements of the drift of the spectrum on the detector over time. We achieve almost photon-limited results for individual spectral bins, but the uncertainties in the transit depth for the the band-integrated data are exacerbated by the uneven sampling of the light curve imposed by the orbital phasing of HST's observations. Our final transit spectra for all three objects are consistent with the presence of a broad absorption feature at 1.4 microns potentially due to water. However, the amplitude of the absorption is less than that expected based on previous observations with Spitzer, possibly due to hazes absorbing in the NIR or non-solar compositions. The degeneracy of models with different compositions and temperature structures combined with the low amplitude of any features in the data preclude our ability to place unambiguous constraints on the atmospheric composition without additional observations with WFC3 to improve the S/N and/or a comprehensive multi-wavelength analysis.",13,[],1
1305.0277,astro-ph,"We present KPNO 4-m and LBT/MODS spectroscopic observations of an HII region in the nearby dwarf irregular galaxy Leo P discovered recently in the Arecibo ALFALFA survey. In both observations, we are able to accurately measure the temperature sensitive [O III] 4363 Angstrom line and determine a ""direct"" oxygen abundance of 12  log(O/H) = 7.17 /- 0.04. Thus, Leo P is an extremely metal deficient (XMD) galaxy, and, indeed, one of the most metal deficient star-forming galaxies ever observed. For its estimated luminosity, Leo P is consistent with the relationship between luminosity and oxygen abundance seen in nearby dwarf galaxies. Leo P shows normal alpha element abundance ratios (Ne/O, S/O, and Ar/O) when compared to other XMD galaxies, but elevated N/O, consistent with the ""delayed release"" hypothesis for N/O abundances. We derive a helium mass fraction of 0.2509 0.0184 -0.0123 which compares well with the WMAP  BBN prediction of 0.2483 /- 0.0002 for the primordial helium abundance. We suggest that surveys of very low mass galaxies compete well with emission line galaxy surveys for finding XMD galaxies. It is possible that XMD galaxies may be divided into two classes: the relatively rare XMD emission line galaxies which are associated with starbursts triggered by infall of low-metallicity gas and the more common, relatively quiescent XMD galaxies like Leo P, with very low chemical abundances due to their intrinsically small masses.",13,[],1
1307.7041,astro-ph,"The flaring activity of the Crab Nebula is one of the most puzzling phenomena of the gamma ray sky. The light curves in the energy range E >100 MeV show a high flux variability on time scales ranging from hours to weeks, with sharp emission peaks superimposed to long lasting smoother modulations, whose origin is still under debate. A long term observation of the Crab Nebula at TeV energies could add useful information to understand the mechanisms responsible of this unexpected behavior. The air shower detector ARGO-YBJ monitored the Crab Nebula in the energy range 0.5-20 TeV from November 2007 to February 2013. During the flaring episodes observed by Fermi, the average ARGO-YBJ flux is found to be a factor 2.4  0.8 larger than the average value. Performing a long term study of the Crab Nebula flux, the ARGO-YBJ light curve is consistent with a uniform flux with a probability of 0.11. However, a comparison with the Fermi LAT light curve during 4.5 years shows a correlation between the data of the two experiments. The percent flux variations observed by ARGO-YBJ with respect to the average value are consistent with the variations of the Fermi rate, suggesting, in the hypotesis that the modulations are real, the same physical process at the origin of the observed flux variations.",13,[],1
1308.5702,astro-ph,"We present new high contrast imaging of 8 L/T transition brown dwarfs using the NIRC2 camera on the Keck II telescope. One of our targets, the T3.5 dwarf 2MASS J08381155  1511155, was resolved into a hierarchal triple with projected separations of 2.5/-0.5 AU and 27/-5 AU for the BC and A(BC) components respectively. Resolved OSIRIS spectroscopy of the A(BC) components confirm that all system members are T dwarfs. The system therefore constitutes the first triple T-dwarf system ever reported. Using resolved photometry to model the integrated-light spectrum, we infer spectral types of T3, T3, and T4.5 for the A, B, and C components respectively. The uniformly brighter primary has a bluer J-Ks color than the next faintest component, which may reflect a sensitive dependence of the L/T transition temperature on gravity, or alternatively divergent cloud properties amongst components. Relying on empirical trends and evolutionary models we infer a total system mass of 0.034-0.104 Msun for the BC components at ages of 0.3-3 Gyr, which would imply a period of 12-21 yr assuming the system semi-major axis to be similar to its projection. We also infer differences in effective temperatures and surface gravities between components of no more than ~150 K and ~0.1 dex. Given the similar physical properties of the components, the 2M083815 system provides a controlled sample for constraining the relative roles of effective temperature, surface gravity, and dust clouds in the poorly understood L/T transition regime. Combining our imaging survey results with previous work we find an observed binary fraction of 4/18 or 22-810% for unresolved spectral types of L9-T4 at separations >~0.1 arcsec. This translates into a volume-corrected frequency of 13-67%, which is similar to values of ~9-12% reported outside the transition. (ABRIDGED)",13,[],1
1308.6185,astro-ph,"Dust polarization observations from the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) are analyzed with the goal of providing a general tool to interpret the role of the magnetic field in molecular clouds. Magnetic field and dust emission gradient orientations are observed to show distinct patterns and features. The angle equation between these two orientations can be interpreted as a magnetic field alignment deviation, assuming the emission gradient orientation to coincide with the density gradient orientation in the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) force equation. In SMA high-resolution (collapsing) cores, additional symmetry properties in equation can reveal accretion and outflow zones. All these observational findings suggest the angle equation to be a relevant quantity that can assess the role of the magnetic field. Indeed, when comparing this angle with the (projection-free) magnetic field significance letterB (Koch et al. 2012a), it is demonstrated that letter yields an approximation to the change in letterB. Thus, changes in the magnetic field alignment deviation equation trace changes in the role of the magnetic field. The angle equation is observationally straightforward to determine, providing a tool to distinguish between zones of minor or significant magnetic field impact. This is exemplified by the CSO M0.250.01, Mon R2, CO0.02-0.02, M-0.02-0.07 sources and by the SMA high-resolution data from W51 e2, W51 North, Orion BN/KL and g5.89. Additional CSO sources are analyzed, providing further support of this result. Finally, based on the different features found in our sample of 31 sources in total, covering sizes from large-scale complexes to collapsing cores, a schematic evolutionary scenario is proposed (abridged).",13,[],1
1304.5231,astro-ph,"We use Spitzer IRS spectroscopy to study the nature 65 IR-luminous galaxies at 0.02 < z < 0.6 with F(24micron) > 1.2mJy. The IRS spectra cover wavelengths spanning the PAH features and important atomic diagnostic lines. Our sample corresponds to L(IR) = L(8-1000micron) = 1010-1012 Lsun. We divide our galaxies into those with Spitzer IRAC colors indicative of warm dust heated by an AGN (IRAGN) and those whose colors indicate star-formation processes (non-IRAGN). Compared to the non-IRAGN, the IRAGN show smaller PAH emission EWs, which we attribute to an increase in mid-IR continuum from the AGN. We find that in both the IRAGN and non-IRAGN samples, the PAH luminosities correlate strongly with the [Ne II] emission, from which we conclude that the PAH luminosity directly traces the instantaneous SFR in both the IRAGN and non-IRAGN galaxies. We compare the ratio of PAH luminosity to the total IR luminosity and show that for most IRAGN star-formation accounts for 10-50% of the L(IR). We also find no measurable difference between the PAH luminosity ratios of L(11.3)/L(7.7) and L(6.2)/L(7.7) for the IRAGN and non-IRAGN, suggesting that AGN do not significantly excite or destroy PAH molecules on galaxy-wide scales. A small subset of galaxies show excess of [O IV] emission compared to their PAH emission, which indicates the presence of heavily-obscured AGN, including 3 galaxies that are not otherwise selected as IRAGN. The low PAH emission and low [Ne II] emission of the IRAGN and [O IV]-excess objects imply they have low SFRs and their IR luminosity is dominated by processes associated with the AGN.",13,[],1
1312.0609,astro-ph,"We study the evolution of circumstellar disks in 22 young (1 to 100 Myr) nearby (within 500 pc) associations over the entire mass spectrum using photometry covering from the optical to the mid-infrared. We compiled a catalog of 2340 spectroscopically-confirmed members of these nearby associations. We analyzed their spectral energy distributions and searched for excess related to the presence of protoplanetary disks in a homogeneous way. Sensitivity limits and spatial completeness were also considered. We derive disk fractions as probed by mid-infrared excess in these regions. The unprecedented size of our sample allows us to confirm the timescale of disk decay reported in the literature and to find new trends. The fraction of excess sources increases systematically if measured at longer wavelengths. Disk percentages derived using different wavelength ranges should therefore be compared with caution. The dust probed at 22-24 um evolves slower than that probed at shorter wavelengths (3.4-12 um). Assuming an exponential decay, we derive a timescale tau=4.2-5.8 Myr at 22-24 um for primordial disks, compared to 2-3 Myr at shorter wavelength (3.4-12 um). Primordial disks disappear around 10 Myr, matching in time a brief increase of the number of 'evolved' disks. The increase in timescale of excess decay at longer wavelength is compatible with inside-out disk clearing scenarios. The increased timescale of decay and larger dispersion in the distribution of disk fractions at 22-24 um suggest that the inner and outer zones evolve differently, the latter potentially following a variety of evolutionary paths. The drop of primordial disks and the coincident rise of evolved disks at 10 Myr are compatible with planet formation theories suggesting that the disappearance of the gas is immediately followed by the dynamical stirring of the disk.",13,[],1
1312.6307,astro-ph,"We carried out an extensive observational study of the Slowly Pulsating B (SPB) star, HD 25558. The ~2000 spectra obtained at different observatories, the ground-based and MOST satellite light curves revealed that this object is a double-lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of about 9 years. The observations do not allow the inference of an orbital solution. We determined the physical parameters of the components, and found that both lie within the SPB instability strip. Accordingly, both show line-profile variations due to stellar pulsations. Eleven independent frequencies were identified in the data. All the frequencies were attributed to one of the two components based on Pixel-by-pixel variability analysis of the line profiles. Spectroscopic and photometric mode identification was also performed for the frequencies of both stars. These results suggest that the inclination and rotation of the two components are rather different. The primary is a slow rotator with ~6 d period, seen at ~60 deg inclination, while the secondary rotates fast with ~1.2 d period, and is seen at ~20 inclination. Spectropolarimetric measurements revealed that the secondary component has a magnetic field with at least a few hundred Gauss strength, while no magnetic field can be detected in the primary.",13,[],1
1310.3680,astro-ph,"Observations of quasars at equation report the existence of a billion solar mass black holes. Comprehending their formation in such a short time scale is a matter of ongoing research. One of the most promising scenarios to assemble supermassive black holes is a monolithic collapse of protogalactic gas clouds in atomic cooling halos with equation. In this article, we study the amplification and impact of magnetic fields during the formation of seed black holes in massive primordial halos. We perform high resolution cosmological magnetohydrodynamics simulations for four distinct halos and follow their collapse for a few free-fall times until the simulations reach a peak density of equation. Our findings show that irrespective of the initial seed field, the magnetic field strength reaches a saturated state in the presence of strong accretion shocks. Under such conditions, the growth time becomes very short and amplification occurs rapidly within a small fraction of the free-fall time. We find that the presence of such strong magnetic fields provides additional support against gravity and helps in suppressing fragmentation. Massive clumps of a few hundred solar masses are formed at the end of our simulations and high accretion rates of equation are observed. We expect that in the presence of such accretion rates, the clumps will grow to form supermassive stars of equation. Overall, the role of the magnetic fields seems supportive for the formation of massive black holes.",13,[],1

The \ionHe1 lines in these CTTSs contain both narrow emission cores, believed to come from near the accretion shock region on these stars, and broad emission components which may come from either a wind or the large scale magnetospheric accretion flow. We detect strong polarization in the narrow component of the two \ionHe1 emission lines in both stars. We observe a maximum implied field strength of equation kG in the 5876 \AA\ line of GQ Lup, making it the star with the highest field strength measured in this line for a CTTS. We find field strengths in the two \ionHe1 lines that are consistent with each other, in contrast to what has been reported in the literature on at least one star.

We detected SiO fundamental lines in all of our program stars except for GCIRS3. The SiO lines in normal K and M giants as well as optically bright red supergiants do not show P-Cyg profiles or blueshifts, which means the absence of systematic outflows in the SiO line forming region. On the other hand, we detected P-Cyg profiles in the SiO lines in the dusty red supergiants VY CMa and VX Sgr (with the latter being a new detection), which suggest outflow velocities of 27 and 17 km/s, respectively. We derived basic stellar parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, luminosity, and mass) for the normal K--M giants and optically bright red supergiants in our sample and compared the observed VISIR spectra with synthetic spectra predicted from MARCS photospheric models. Most of the SiO lines observed in the program stars warmer than ~3400 K are reasonably reproduced by the MARCS models, which allowed us to estimate the silicon abundance as well as the 28Si/29Si and 28Si/30Si ratios. However, we detected possible absorption excess in some SiO lines. Moreover, the SiO lines in the cooler red giants and red supergiant cannot be explained by the MARCS models at all even if the dust emission is taken into account.

1309.2243,astro-ph,"Lagrangian displacement field equation is the central object in Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT). LPT is very successful at high redshifts, but it performs poorly at low redshifts due to severe shell crossing. To understand and quantify the effects of shell crossing, we extract equation from N-body simulation and decompose it into scalar and vector parts. We find that at late time the power spectrum of the scalar part agrees with 1-loop results from LPT at large scales, while the power in small scales is much suppressed due to shell crossing. At z=0, the power spectrum of equation is 10% lower than the 1-loop results at k = 0.1 h/Mpc. Shell crossing also generates the vector contribution in equation, although its effect is subdominant in comparison with the power suppression in the scalar part. At z=0, the vector part contributes 10% to the total power spectrum of equation at k = 1 h/Mpc, while only 1% is expected from the vector contribution in LPT. We also examine the standard LPT recipes and some of its variants. In one of the variants, we include a power suppression factor in the displacement potential to take into account the power suppression in small scales after shell crossing. However, these simple phenomenological approaches are found to yield limited improvement compared to the standard LPT after the onset of shell crossing.",13,[],1

We find that due to the cell shape, the unshaded portion of a partially shaded cell experiences higher heat dissipation due to a redistribution of voltages and currents in this two dimensional geometry. We also analyze the effect of shadow size and orientation by considering several possible shading scenarios.

1312.2708,cond-mat,We consider the multiple scattering of light by fluctuations of the director in a nematic liquid crystal. Using methods of numerical simulation the peak of the coherent backscattering and the coefficients of anisotropic diffusion are calculated. The calculations were carried out without simplifying assumptions on the properties of the liquid crystal. The process of multiple scattering was simulated as a random walk of photons in the medium. We investigated in detail the transition to the diffusion regime. The dependence of the diffusion coefficients on the applied magnetic field and the wavelength of light were studied. The results of simulation showed a non-monotonic dependence of the diffusion coefficients on the external magnetic field. A qualitative explanation of this behaviour was suggested using a simple scalar model. For calculation of the peak of the coherent backscattering we used the semianalytical approach as long as in nematic liquid crystals this peak is extremely narrow. The parameters of backscattering peak and of diffusion coefficients which were found in numerical simulations were compared with the experimental data and the results of analytical calculation.,13,[],8

The present study highlights an often overlook issue in first-principles calculations that long time MD is essential to achieve ergodicity, which is mandatory for a proper description of dynamics of a system.

1301.2639,cond-mat,"We show that the resistance of the v=5/2 quantum Hall state, confined to an interferometer, oscillates with magnetic field consistent with an Ising-type non-Abelian state. In three quantum Hall interferometers of different sizes, resistance oscillations at v=7/3 and integer filling factors have the magnetic field period expected if the number of quasiparticles contained within the interferometer changes so as to keep the area and the total charge within the interferometer constant. Under these conditions, an Abelian state such as the (3,3,1) state would show oscillations with the same period as at an integer quantum Hall state. However, in an Ising-type non-Abelian state there would be a rapid oscillation associated with the ""even-odd effect"" and a slower one associated with the accumulated Abelian phase due to both the Aharonov-Bohm effect and the Abelian part of the quasiparticle braiding statistics. Our measurements at v=5/2 are consistent with the latter.",13,[],8
1310.3134,cond-mat,"When an intruder strikes a granular material from above, the grains exert a stopping force which decelerates and stops the intruder. Many previous studies have used a macroscopic force law, including a drag force which is quadratic in velocity, to characterize the decelerating force on the intruder. However, the microscopic origins of the force law terms are still a subject of debate. Here, drawing from previous experiments with photoelastic particles, we present a model which describes the velocity-squared force in terms of repeated collisions with clusters of grains. From our high speed photoelastic data, we infer that `clusters' correspond to segments of the strong force network that are excited by the advancing intruder. The model predicts a scaling relation for the velocity-squared drag force that accounts for the intruder shape. Additionally, we show that the collisional model predicts an instability to rotations, which depends on the intruder shape. To test this model, we perform a comprehensive experimental study of the dynamics of two-dimensional granular impacts on beds of photoelastic disks, with different profiles for the leading edge of the intruder. We particularly focus on a simple and useful case for testing shape effects by using triangular-nosed intruders. We show that the collisional model effectively captures the dynamics of intruder deceleration and rotation; i.e., these two dynamical effects can be described as two different manifestations of the same grain-scale physical processes.",13,[],8

1307.7506,cond-mat,"Numerical simulations and experiments on nanostructures out of equilibrium usually exhibit strong finite size and finite measuring time equation effects. We discuss how these affect the determination of the full counting statistics for a general quantum impurity problem. We find that, while there are many methods available to improve upon finite-size effects, any real-time simulation or experiment will still be subject to finite time effects: in short size matters, but time is limiting. We show that the leading correction to the cumulant generating function (CGF) at zero temperature for single-channel quantum impurity problems goes as equation and is universally related to the steady state CGF itself for non-interacting systems. We then give detailed numerical evidence for the case of the self-dual interacting resonant level model that this relation survives the addition of interactions. This allows the extrapolation of finite measuring time in our numerics to the long-time limit, to excellent agreement with Bethe-ansatz results.",13,[],8

With the specific strain, the resonant tunneling is completely suppressed for Dirac fermions occupying the one valley, but the resonant tunneling exists for the other valley.

The microscopic holes created by the filamentation of the initial distribution function are always restricted to the outer regions of the phase space. In general, for complex multilevel distributions it is very difficult to a priori predict the final stationary state without solving the full dynamical evolution.

1301.2395,cond-mat,"Disproportionation in 3d compounds can give rise to an unconventional electron-hole Bose liquid with a very rich phase diagram from a Bose metal, charge ordering insulator to an inhomogeneous Bose superfluid. Optimal conditions for the disproportionation driven high-Tc superconductivity are shown to realize only for several Jahn-Teller dn configurations that permit the formation of well defined local composite bosons. These are the high-spin d4, low-spin d7, and d9 configurations given the octahedral crystal field, and the d1, high-spin d6 configurations given the tetrahedral crystal field. The disproportionation reaction has a peculiar anti-Jahn- Teller character lifting the bare orbital degeneracy. Superconductivity in the d4 and d6 systems at variance with d1, d7, and d9 systems implies an unavoidable coexistence of the spin-triplet composite bosons and a magnetic lattice. We argue that unconventional high-Tc superconductivity observed in quasi-2D cuprates with tetragonally distorted CuO6 octahedra and iron-based layered pnictides/chalcogenides with tetrahedrally coordinated Fe2 ions can be a key argument supporting the disproportionation scenario is at work in these compounds.",13,[],8

We derive the meanfield theory for both ground state and low-energy pair excitations in the general case where both one-body and two-body couplings are position-dependent and the fluid is subjected to a state-dependent trapping potential. General formulas for phase and density correlations are also derived. Focusing on the case of homogeneous systems, we discuss the pair-excitation spectrum and the corresponding excitation modes, and use them to calculate correlation functions, including both quantum and thermal fluctuation terms. We show that the relative phase of the two components is imposed by that of the one-body coupling, while its fluctuations are determined by the modulus of the one-body coupling and by the two-body coupling. One-body coupling and repulsive two-body coupling cooperate to suppress relative-phase fluctuations, while attractive two-body coupling tends to enhance them.

Within the framework of an extended T-matrix approximation, we calculate the single-particle density of states, as well as the single-particle spectral weight, to show that the so-called pseudogap phenomenon gradually disappears with increasing the magnitude of an effective magnetic field. In the highly spin-polarized regime, the calculated spin-polarization rate as a function of the effective magnetic field agrees well with the recent experiment on a 6Li Fermi gas. Although this experiment has been considered to be incompatible with the existence of the pseudogap in an unpolarized Fermi gas, our result clarifies that the observed spin-polarization rate in the highly spin-polarized regime and the pseudogap in the unpolarized limit can be explained in a consistent manner, when one correctly includes effects of population imbalance on single-particle excitations. Since it is a crucial issue to clarify whether the pseudogap exists or not in the BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer)-BEC (Bose-Einstein condensation) crossover regime of an ultracold Fermi gas, our results would be useful for the understanding of this strongly interacting fermion system.",13,[],8

Oxygen vacancies induced by synchrotron radiation migrate under- neath this overlayer, this leads to a confining potential and electron doping such that a 2DEG develops. Our angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and theoretical results show that confinement along (110) is strikingly different from a (001) crystal orientation. In particular the quantized subbands show a surprising ""semi-heavy"" band, in contrast to the analogue in the bulk, and a high electronic anisotropy.

Whereas classical particles would be randomly partitioned by the splitter, we observe two-particle interferences resulting from quantum exchange.

1310.8222,cond-mat,"We study the behaviour of cubic blue phases under shear flow via lattice Boltzmann simulations. We focus on the two experimentally observed phases, Blue Phase I (BPI) and Blue Phase II (BPII). The disclination network of Blue Phase II continuously breaks and reforms under steady shear, leading to an oscillatory stress response in time. For larger shear rates, the structure breaks up into a Grandjean texture with a cholesteric helix lying along the flow gradient direction. Blue Phase I leads to a very different response. Here, oscillations are only possible for intermediate shear rates -- very slow flow causes a transition of the initially ordered structure into an amorphous network with an apparent yield stress. Larger shear rates lead to another amorphous state with different structure of the defect network. For even larger flow rates the same break-up into a Grandjean texture as for Blue Phase II is observed. At the highest imposed flow rates both cubic blue phases adopt a flow-aligned nematic state. Our results provide the first theoretical investigation of sheared blue phases in large systems, and are relevant to understanding the bulk rheology of these materials.",13,[],8

The results are interpreted within the scenario of the spin-state crossover from a room-temperature mixture of the intermediate spin Coequation and low spin Coequation (IS/LS) at the to the LS/LS mixture in the sample ground states. In contrast to the yttrium free equation that retains the metallic-like character and exhibits ferromagnetic ordering below 55 K, the doped system equation undergoes a first-order metal-insulator transition at 132 K, during which not only the crossover to low spin states but also a partial electron transfer from Prequation 4f to cobalt 3d states take place simultaneously. Taking into account the non-magnetic character of LS Coequation, such valence shift electronic transition causes a magnetic dilution, formally to 0.12 LS Coequation or 0.12 equation hole spins per f.u., which is the reason for an insulating, highly non-uniform magnetic ground state without long-range order. Nevertheless, even in that case there exists a relatively strong molecular field distributed over all the crystal lattice. It is argued that the spontaneous FM order in equation and the existence of strong FM correlations in equation apparently contradict the single equation band character of LS/LS phase. The explanation we suggest relies on a model of the defect induced, itinerant hole mediated magnetism, where the defects are identified with the magnetic high-spin Coequation species stabilized near oxygen vacancies.",13,[],8

The solution of the auxiliary model does not require the evaluation of a memory kernel and can thus be implemented in a very memory efficient way. The mapping is derived for a self-energy which is local in space and is thus directly applicable within nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). We apply the method to study the interaction quench in the Hubbard model for an optical lattice with a narrow confinement, using inhomogeneous DMFT in combination with second-order weak-coupling perturbation theory.

For AFM insulators that preserve this combined symmetry, regardless of any details in lattice structure or magnetic structure, we show that (i) there is a new type of Kramers' degeneracy protected by the combined symmetry; (ii) a new equation index may be defined for 3D AFM insulators, but not for those in lower dimensions and (iii) in 3D AFM insulators with a non-trivial equation index, there are odd number of gapless surface modes if and only if the surface termination also preserves the combined symmetry, but the dispersion of surface states becomes highly anisotropic if the AFM propagation vector becomes small compared with the reciprocal lattice vectors.

At previously unexplored high energies, our data show signatures of multiple van Hove singularities (vHSs) in the tBLG bands, as well as the nonlinearity of the single layer graphene bands and their electron-hole asymmetry. Our data also suggest that excitonic effects play a vital role in the optical spectra of tBLG. Including electron-hole interactions in first-principles calculations is essential to reproduce the shape of the conductivity spectra, and we find evidence of coherent interactions between the states associated with the multiple vHSs in tBLG.",13,[],8
1311.1118,cond-mat,"We develop an analytic approach for the study of the quench dynamics of the anisotropic Heisenberg model (XXZ model) on the infinite line. We present the exact time-dependent wavefunctions after a quench in an integral form for any initial state and for any anisotropy equation by means of a generalized Yudson contour representation. We calculate the evolution of several observables from two particular initial states: starting with a local N\`eel state we calculate the time evolution of the antiferromagnetic order parameter--staggered magnetization; starting with a state with consecutive flipped spins we calculate the propagation of magnons and bound state excitations, and the induced spin currents. We also show how the ""string"" solution of Bethe Ansatz equations emerge naturally from the contour approach. We confront our results with experiments and numerical methods where possible.",13,[],8
1301.3108,cond-mat,"Spin-flip Raman scattering of electrons and heavy-holes is studied for resonant excitation of neutral and charged excitons in a CdTe/CdequationMgequationTe quantum well. The spin-flip scattering is characterized by its dependence on the incident and scattered light polarization as well as on the magnetic field strength and orientation. Model schemes of electric-dipole allowed spin-flip Raman processes in the exciton complexes are compared to the experimental observations, from which we find that lowering of the exciton symmetry, time of carrier spin relaxation, and mixing between electron states and, respectively, light- and heavy-hole states play an essential role in the scattering. At the exciton resonance, anisotropic exchange interaction induces heavy-hole spin-flip scattering, while acoustic phonon interaction is mainly responsible for the electron spin-flip. In resonance with the positively and negatively charged excitons, anisotropic electron-hole exchange as well as mixed electron states allow spin-flip scattering. Variations in the resonant excitation energy and lattice temperature demonstrate that localization of resident electrons and holes controls the Raman process probability and is also responsible for symmetry reduction. We show that the intensity of the electron spin-flip scattering is strongly affected by the lifetime of the exciton complex and in tilted magnetic fields by the angular dependence of the anisotropic electron-hole exchange interaction.",13,[],8
1309.0940,cond-mat,"We present the high-temperature expansion (HTE) up to 10th order of the specific heat C and the uniform susceptibility letter for Heisenberg models with arbitrary exchange patterns and arbitrary spin quantum number s. We encode the algorithm in a C program which allows to get explicitly the HTE series for concrete Heisenberg models. We apply our algorithm to pyrochlore ferromagnets and kagome antiferromagnets using several Pad\'e approximants for the HTE series. For the pyrochlore ferromagnet we use the HTE data for letter to estimate the Curie temperature Tc as a function of the spin quantum number s. We find that Tc is smaller than that for the simple cubic lattice, although both lattices have the same coordination number. For the kagome antiferromagnet the influence of the spin quantum number s on the susceptibility as a function of renormalized temperature T/s(s1) is rather weak for temperatures down to T/s(s1) \sim 0.3. On the other hand, the specific heat as a function of T/s(s1) noticeably depends on s. The characteristic maximum in C(T) is monotonously shifted to lower values of T/s(s1) when increasing s.",13,[],8
1312.1754,cond-mat,"We fabricated an etched hole quantum dot in a Si-doped (311)A AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure to study disorder effects via magnetoconductance fluctuations (MCF) at millikelvin temperatures. Recent experiments in electron quantum dots have shown that the MCF is sensitive to the disorder potential created by remote ionised impurities. We utilize this to study the temporal/thermal stability of Si acceptors in p-type AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures. In particular, we use a surface gate to cause charge migration between Si acceptor sites at T = 40 mK, and detect the ensuing changes in the disorder potential using the MCF. We show that Si acceptors are metastable at T = 40 mK and that raising the device to a temperature T = 4.2 K and returning to T = 40 mK is sufficient to produce complete decorrelation of the MCF. The same decorrelation occurs at T ~ 165 K for electron quantum dots; by comparing with the known trap energy for Si DX centers, we estimate that the shallow acceptor traps in our heterostructures have an activation energy EA ~ 3 meV. Our method can be used to study charge noise and dopant stability towards optimisation of semiconductor materials and devices.",13,[],8

Optical band gap of equation is deduced from linear optical measurements. Nonlinear optical properties are studied by single beam Z-scan measurements at 800 nm, where two-photon absorption is present.

We apply the method to the bilayer Heisenberg model with bond randomness and characterize both the broadening of excitations and the transfer of spectral weight induced by disorder. Inside the antiferromagnetic phase this model features the remarkable combination of sharp magnetic Bragg peaks and broad magnons, the latter arising from the tendency to localization of low-energy excitations.",13,[],8
1311.3015,cond-mat,"We report on the observation of the hysteretic transition of a commensurate charge modulation in IrTeequation from transport and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies. Below the transition (equation K on cooling) a equation charge modulation was observed, which is consistent with previous studies. Additional modulations [equation] appear below a second transition at equation K on cooling. The coexistence of various modulations persist up to equation on warming. The atomic structures of charge modulations and the temperature dependent STM studies suggest that 1/5 modulation is a periodic soliton lattice which partially melts below equation on cooling. Our results provide compelling evidence that the ground state of IrTeequation is a commensurate 1/6 charge modulation, which originates from periodic dimerization of Te atoms visualized by atomically resolved STM images.",13,[],8
1312.5181,cond-mat,"We present a first-principles study of model domain walls (DWs) in prototypic ferroelectric PbTiO3. At high temperature the DW structure is somewhat trivial, with atoms occupying high- symmetry positions. However, upon cooling the DW undergoes a symmetry-breaking transition characterized by a giant dielectric anomaly and the onset of a large and switchable polarization. Our results thus corroborate previous arguments for the occurrence of ferroic orders at structural DWs, providing a detailed atomistic picture of a temperature-driven DW-confined transformation. Beyond its relevance to the field of ferroelectrics, our results highlight the interest of these DWs in the broader areas of low-dimensional physics and phase transitions in strongly-fluctuating systems.",13,[],8
1310.7515,cond-mat,"We demonstrate that the spectroscopic g-factor can be determined with high precision and accuracy by broadband ferromagnetic resonance measurements and applying an asymptotic analysis to the data. Spectroscopic data used to determine the g-factor is always obtained over a finite range of frequencies, which can result in significant errors in the fitted values of the spectroscopic g-factor. We show that by applying an asymptotic analysis to broadband datasets, precise values of the intrinsic g-factor can be determined with errors well below 1 %, even when the exact form of the Kittel equation (which describes the relationship between the frequency and resonance field) is unknown. We demonstrate this methodology with measured data obtained for sputtered Ni80Fe20 (""Permalloy"") thin films of varied thicknesses, where we determine the bulk g-factor value to be 2.109 /- 0.003. Such an approach is further validated by application to simulated data that includes both noise and an anisotropy that is not included in the Kittel equation that was used in the analysis. Finally, we show a correlation of thickness and interface structure to the magnitude of the asymptotic behavior, which provide insight into additional mechanisms that may induce deviations from the Kittel equation.",13,[],8
1311.6861,cond-mat,"We investigate the quantum tunneling of electrons in an AA-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) equation-equation junction and equation-equation-equation junction. We show that Klein tunneling of an electron can occur in this system. The quasiparticles are not only chiral but are additionally described by a `cone index'. Due to the orthogonality of states with different cone indexes, electron transport across a potential barrier must strictly conserve the cone index and this leads to the protected cone transport which is unique in AA-stacked BLG. Together with the negative refraction of electrons, electrons residing in different cones can be spatially separated according to their cone index when transmitted across an equation-equation junction. This suggests the possibility of `cone-tronic' devices based on AA-stacked BLG. Finally, we calculate the junction conductance of the system.",13,[],8
1306.3086,cond-mat,"Effects of the Co substitution have been observed on the structural, magnetic and magneto-transport properties of Fe2-xCoxMnSi alloy. Curie temperature (TC) and saturation magnetization (MS) of these alloys increased linearly with the Co substitution.

The value of Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratio pc/ps is greater than one for these alloys which is the characteristics of iterant magnetism present in the system. Mossbauer spectroscopic measurements have been done to investigate the atomic disorder and local magnetic moment for some x values.

The resulting parameters are consistent with a Zequation spin liquid rather than with a valence-bond crystal, in agreement with the last density matrix renormalization group results.",13,[],8

This anisotropy is induced by a piezoelectric actuator on which the film/substrate system was glued. In our work, the control of the anisotropy through the applied elastic strains is facilitated by the compliant elastic behavior of the substrate. The in-plane strains in the film induced by the piezoelectric actuation have been measured by the digital image correlation technique. Non-linear variation of the resonance field as function of the applied voltage is found and well reproduced by taking into account the non linear and hysteretic variations of the induced in-plane strains as function of the applied voltage. Moreover, we show that initial uniaxial anisotropy attributed to compliant substrate curvature is fully compensated by the voltage induced anisotropy.",13,[],8

Ferromagnetism persists to smaller deviations from the cubic perovskite structure than is the case for the bulk rare earth titanates.

In this first paper, we consider the low temperature coherent regime where the electron transmission through the nanowire remains elastic. In the limit where the nanowire length exceeds the electron localization length, we derive three analytical expressions for the typical value of the thermopower as a function of the gate potential, in the cases where the electron transport takes place (i) inside the impurity band of the nanowire, (ii) around its band edges and eventually (iii) outside its band. We obtain a very large enhancement of the typical thermopower at the band edges, while the sample to sample fluctuations around the typical value exhibit a sharp crossover from a Lorentzian distribution inside the impurity band towards a Gaussian distribution as the band edges are approached.",13,[],8

Through the combination of x-ray absorption spectroscopy and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), we find that Ni plays an important role along with Mn in the overall magnetism. A significant hybridization that develops between Mn and Ni orbitals results in a small antiferromagnetic moment at Ni sites. The shift in the XMCD hysteresis loops in the martensitic phase suggests that antiferromagnetism results from superexchange like interactions between Mn atoms mediated by Ni.",13,[],8
1307.3828,cond-mat,"We report the thermal spin injection and accumulation in crystalline CoFe/MgO tunnel contacts to n-type Si through Seebeck spin tunneling (SST). With the Joule heating (laser heating) of Si (CoFe), the thermally induced spin accumulation is detected by means of the Hanle effect for both polarities of the temperature gradient across the tunnel contact. The magnitude of the thermal spin signal scales linearly with the heating power and its sign is reversed as we invert the temperature gradient, demonstrating the major features of SST and thermal spin accumulation. We observe that, for the Si (CoFe) heating, the thermal spin signal induced by SST corresponds to the majority (minority) spin accumulation in the Si. Based on a quantitative comparison of thermal and electrical spin signals, it is noted that the thermal spin injection through SST can be a viable approach for the efficient injection of spin accumulation",13,[],8
1304.1663,cond-mat,"In many systems, nucleation of a stable solid may occur in the presence of other (often more than one) metastable phases. These may be polymorphic solids or even liquid phases. In such cases, nucleation of the solid phase from the melt may be facilitated by the metastable phase because the latter can ""wet"" the interface between the parent and the daughter phases, even though there may be no signature of the existence of metastable phase in the thermodynamic properties of the parent liquid and the stable solid phase. Straightforward application of classical nucleation theory (CNT) is flawed here as it overestimates the nucleation barrier since surface tension is overestimated (by neglecting the metastable phases of intermediate order) while the thermodynamic free energy gap between daughter and parent phases remains unchanged. In this work we discuss a density functional theory (DFT) based statistical mechanical approach to explore and quantify such facilitation. We construct a simple order parameter dependent free energy surface that we then use in DFT to calculate (i) the order parameter profile, (ii) the overall nucleation free energy barrier and (iii) the surface tension between the parent liquid and the metastable solid and also parent liquid and stable solid phases. The theory indeed finds that the nucleation free energy barrier can decrease significantly in the presence of wetting. This approach can provide a microscopic explanation of Ostwald step rule and the well-known phenomenon of ""disappearing polymorphs"" that depends on temperature and other thermodynamic conditions. Theory reveals a diverse scenario for phase transformation kinetics some of which may be explored via modern nanoscopic synthetic methods.",13,[],8

The difference in the thermal transport between corrugated nanowires and straight ones demonstrates a strong reduction in the mean free path of the phonons. This averaged mean free path is remarkably smaller than the smaller diameter of the nanowire, evidencing a phonon thermal transport reduced below the Casimir limit. Monte Carlo simulations highlight that this effect can be attributed to significant multiple scattering of ballistic phonons occuring on the corrugated surfaces.

We calculate the relationship between Josephson current and phase difference. At temperatures close to critical, calculations are performed analytically in the frame of the Ginsburg-Landau equations. At low temperatures numerical method is developed to solve selfconsistently the Usadel equations in the structure. We demonstrate that SIsFS junctions have several distinct regimes of supercurrent transport and we examine spatial distributions of the pair potential across the structure in different regimes. We study the crossover between these regimes which is caused by shifting the location of a weak link from the tunnel barrier 'I' to the F-layer. We show that strong deviations of the CPR from sinusoidal shape occur even in a vicinity of Tc, and these deviations are strongest in the crossover regime.

It is suggested that the Cr/Graphene combination acts akin to a doped n-type semiconductor in contact with AlGaN/GaN heterostructure, and promotes carrier transport along percolating Al-lean paths through the AlGaN layer. This new use of graphene offers a simple and reliable method for making Ohmic contacts to AlGaN/GaN heterostructures, circumventing complex additional processing steps involving high temperatures.

1310.0180,cond-mat,"We derive a theoretical model which describes Bose-Einstein condensation in an open driven-dissipative system. It includes external pumping of a thermal reservoir, finite life time of the condensed particles and energy relaxation. The coupling between the reservoir and the condensate is described with semi-classical Boltzmann rates. This results in a dissipative term in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the condensate, which is proportional to the energy of the elementary excitations of the system. We analyse the main properties of a condensate described by this hybrid Boltzmann Gross-Pitaevskii model, namely, dispersion of the elementary excitations, bogolon distribution function, first order coherence, dynamic and energetic stability, drag force created by a disorder potential. We find that the dispersion of the elementary excitations of a condensed state fulfils the Landau criterion of superfluidity. The condensate is dynamically and energetically stable as longs it moves at a velocity smaller than the speed of excitations. First order spatial coherence of the condensate is found to decay exponentially in 1D and with a power law in 2D, similarly with the case of conservative systems. The coherence lengths are found to be longer due to the finite life time of the condensate excitations. We compare these properties with the ones of a condensate described by the popular ""diffusive"" models in which the dissipative term is proportional to the local condensate density. In the latter, the dispersion of excitations is diffusive which as soon as the condensate is put into motion implies finite mechanical friction and can lead to an energetic instability.",13,[],8

1312.3903,cs,"AI is gradually receiving more attention as a fundamental feature to increase the immersion in digital games. Among the several AI approaches, player modeling is becoming an important one. The main idea is to understand and model the player characteristics and behaviors in order to develop a better AI. In this work, we discuss several aspects of this new field. We proposed a taxonomy to organize the area, discussing several facets of this topic, ranging from implementation decisions up to what a model attempts to describe. We then classify, in our taxonomy, some of the most important works in this field. We also presented a generic approach to deal with player modeling using ML, and we instantiated this approach to model players' preferences in the game Civilization IV. The instantiation of this approach has several steps. We first discuss a generic representation, regardless of what is being modeled, and evaluate it performing experiments with the strategy game Civilization IV. Continuing the instantiation of the proposed approach we evaluated the applicability of using game score information to distinguish different preferences. We presented a characterization of virtual agents in the game, comparing their behavior with their stated preferences. Once we have characterized these agents, we were able to observe that different preferences generate different behaviors, measured by several game indicators. We then tackled the preference modeling problem as a binary classification task, with a supervised learning approach. We compared four different methods, based on different paradigms (SVM, AdaBoost, NaiveBayes and JRip), evaluating them on a set of matches played by different virtual agents. We conclude our work using the learned models to infer human players' preferences. Using some of the evaluated classifiers we obtained accuracies over 60% for most of the inferred preferences.",13,[],7

Lyndon words are used for constructing bases in free Lie algebras, constructing de Bruijn sequences, finding the lexicographically smallest or largest substring in a string, and succinct suffix-prefix matching of highly periodic strings. In this paper, we extend the concept of the Lyndon word to two dimensions. We introduce the 2D Lyndon word and use it to capture 2D horizontal periodicity of a matrix in which each row is highly periodic, and to efficiently solve 2D horizontal suffix-prefix matching among a set of patterns. This yields a succinct and efficient algorithm for 2D dictionary matching.   We present several algorithms that compute the 2D Lyndon word that represents a matrix.

We propose to advance the science in the existing network migration models by considering additional critical factors, including (i) synergistic relationships across multiple technologies, (ii) reduction in operational expenditures (OpEx) as a reason to migrate, and, (iii) implications of local network effects on migration decisions. To this end, we propose a novel agent-based migration model considering these factors. Based on the model, we analyze the case study of network migration to two emerging networking paradigms, i.e., IETF Path Computation Element (PCE) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN).

1305.5665,cs,"Objective: The main objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic performances of an alert system integrated into the CPOE/EMR system for renally cleared drug dosing control. The generated alerts were compared with the daily routine practice of pharmacists as part of the analysis of medication orders. Materials and Methods: The pharmacists performed their analysis of medication orders as usual and were not aware of the alert system interventions that were not displayed for the purpose of the study neither to the physician nor to the pharmacist but kept with associate recommendations in a log file. A senior pharmacist analyzed the results of medication order analysis with and without the alert system. The unit of analysis was the drug prescription line. The primary study endpoints were the detection of drug-dose prescription errors and inter-rater reliability between the alert system and the pharmacists in the detection of drug dose error. Results: The alert system fired alerts in 8.41% (421/5006) of cases: 5.65% (283/5006) exceeds max daily dose alerts and 2.76% (138/5006) under dose alerts. The alert system and the pharmacists showed a relatively poor concordance: 0.106 (CI 95% [0.068, 0.144]). According to the senior pharmacist review, the alert system fired more appropriate alerts than pharmacists, and made fewer errors than pharmacists in analyzing drug dose prescriptions: 143 for the alert system and 261 for the pharmacists. Unlike the alert system, most diagnostic errors made by the pharmacists were false negatives. The pharmacists were not able to analyze a significant number (2097; 25.42%) of drug prescription lines because understaffing. Conclusion: This study strongly suggests that an alert system would be complementary to the pharmacists activity and contribute to drug prescription safety.",13,[],7
1305.3384,cs,"In this paper we present a new approach to content-based transfer learning for solving the data sparsity problem in cases when the users' preferences in the target domain are either scarce or unavailable, but the necessary information on the preferences exists in another domain. We show that training a system to use such information across domains can produce better performance. Specifically, we represent users' behavior patterns based on topological graph structures. Each behavior pattern represents the behavior of a set of users, when the users' behavior is defined as the items they rated and the items' rating values. In the next step we find a correlation between behavior patterns in the source domain and behavior patterns in the target domain. This mapping is considered a bridge between the two domains. Based on the correlation and content-attributes of the items, we train a machine learning model to predict users' ratings in the target domain. When we compare our approach to the popularity approach and KNN-cross-domain on a real world dataset, the results show that on an average of 83equation of the cases our approach outperforms both methods.",13,[],7

To our knowledge, the first such algorithm was proposed by Poloczek and Schnitger; Van Zuylen subsequently gave an algorithm that set the probabilities differently and had a simpler analysis. She also set up a framework for deriving such algorithms. Buchbinder, Feldman, Naor, and Schwartz, as a special case of their work on maximizing submodular functions, also give a randomized 3/4-approximation algorithm for MAX SAT with the same structure as these previous algorithms.

However, at the moment, any polarity lexicon takes into account prior polarity variations across domains. This paper proves that a majority of adjectives change their prior polarity value depending on the domain. We propose a distinction between domain dependent and domain independent adjectives. Moreover, our analysis led us to propose a further classification related to subjectivity degree: constant, mixed and highly subjective adjectives.

1309.4938,cs,"This study proposes a new way of using WordNet for Query Expansion (QE). We choose candidate expansion terms, as usual, from a set of pseudo relevant documents; however, the usefulness of these terms is measured based on their definitions provided in a hand-crafted lexical resource like WordNet. Experiments with a number of standard TREC collections show that this method outperforms existing WordNet based methods. It also compares favorably with established QE methods such as KLD and RM3. Leveraging earlier work in which a combination of QE methods was found to outperform each individual method (as well as other well-known QE methods), we next propose a combination-based QE method that takes into account three different aspects of a candidate expansion term's usefulness: (i) its distribution in the pseudo relevant documents and in the target corpus, (ii) its statistical association with query terms, and (iii) its semantic relation with the query, as determined by the overlap between the WordNet definitions of the term and query terms. This combination of diverse sources of information appears to work well on a number of test collections, viz., TREC123, TREC5, TREC678, TREC robust new and TREC910 collections, and yields significant improvements over competing methods on most of these collections.",13,[],7

1309.4061,cs,"Learning structured models using maximum margin techniques has become an indispensable tool for com- puter vision researchers, as many computer vision applications can be cast naturally as an image labeling problem. Pixel-based or superpixel-based conditional random fields are particularly popular examples. Typ- ically, neighborhood graphs, which contain a large number of cycles, are used. As exact inference in loopy graphs is NP-hard in general, learning these models without approximations is usually deemed infeasible. In this work we show that, despite the theoretical hardness, it is possible to learn loopy models exactly in practical applications. To this end, we analyze the use of multiple approximate inference techniques together with cutting plane training of structural SVMs. We show that our proposed method yields exact solutions with an optimality guarantees in a computer vision application, for little additional computational cost.

If equation is regular, it is possible to find a solution to the uniform sparsest cut of cost equation in nearly linear time.

Although sophisticated methods such as object detection or bag-of-words models have been well studied, they typically operate on low level features and ultimately suffer from either scalability issues or a lack of semantic meaning. On the other hand, video supervoxel segmentation has recently been established and applied to large scale data processing, which potentially serves as an intermediate representation to high level video semantic extraction. The supervoxels are rich decompositions of the video content: they capture object shape and motion well. However, it is not yet known if the supervoxel segmentation retains the semantics of the underlying video content. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of how well the actor and action semantics are retained in video supervoxel segmentation. Our study has human observers watching supervoxel segmentation videos and trying to discriminate both actor (human or animal) and action (one of eight everyday actions). We gather and analyze a large set of 640 human perceptions over 96 videos in 3 different supervoxel scales. Furthermore, we conduct machine recognition experiments on a feature defined on supervoxel segmentation, called supervoxel shape context, which is inspired by the higher order processes in human perception.

We perform a detailed analysis of the support of the subtour elimination linear programming relaxation, which leads to algorithms that find 2-matchings with few components in polynomial time. The number of components directly leads to integrality gap upper bounds for the TSP with distances one and two, for both undirected and directed graphs.   Our main results concern the subtour elimination relaxation with one additional cutting plane inequality:   - For undirected instances we obtain an integrality gap upper bound of 5/4 without any further restrictions, of 7/6 if the optimal LP solution is half-integral.   - For instances of order n where the fractional LP value has a cost of n, we obtain a tight integrality gap upper bound of 10/9 if there is an optimal solution with subcubic support graph. The latter property that the graph is subcubic is implied if the solution is a basic solution in the fractional 2-matching polytope.   - For directed instances we obtain an integrality gap upper bound of 3/2, and of 4/3 if given an optimal 1/2-integral solution. In the case of undirected graphs, we can avoid to add the cutting plane inequality if we accept slightly increased values. For the tight result, the cutting plane is not required.   Additionally, we show that relying on the structure of the support is not an artefact of our algorithm, but is necessary under standard complexity-theoretic assumptions: we show that finding improved solutions via local search is W[1]-hard for k-edge change neighborhoods even for the TSP with distances one and two, which strengthens a result of D\'aniel Marx.",13,[],7

However, although interesting results have been achieved, the methods require the underlying polytope to have very restrictive properties (half-integrality and persistence), which are known only for few problems (essentially Vertex Cover (Nemhauser and Trotter, 1975) and Node Multiway Cut (Garg et al., 1994)). Taking a slightly different approach, we view half-integrality as a \emphdiscrete relaxation of a problem, e.g., a relaxation of the search space from equation to equation such that the new problem admits a polynomial-time exact solution. Using tools from CSP (in particular Thapper and \vZivn\'y, 2012) to study the existence of such relaxations, we provide a much broader class of half-integral polytopes with the required properties, unifying and extending previously known cases.   In addition to the insight into problems with half-integral relaxations, our results yield a range of new and improved FPT algorithms, including an equation-time algorithm for node-deletion Unique Label Cover with label set equation and an equation-time algorithm for Group Feedback Vertex Set, including the setting where the group is only given by oracle access. All these significantly improve on previous results.

1304.6994,cs,"Self-stabilization ensures that, after any transient fault, the system recovers in a finite time and eventually exhibits a correct behaviour. Speculation consists in guaranteeing that the system satisfies its requirements for any execution but exhibits significantly better performances for a subset of executions that are more probable.

We introduce the notion of speculative stabilization which we illustrate through the mutual exclusion problem. We then present a novel speculatively stabilizing mutual exclusion protocol. Our protocol is self-stabilizing for any asynchronous execution. We prove that its stabilization time for synchronous executions is diam(g)/2 steps (where diam(g) denotes the diameter of the system). This complexity result is of independent interest. The celebrated mutual exclusion protocol of Dijkstra stabilizes in n steps (where n is the number of processes) in synchronous executions and the question whether the stabilization time could be strictly smaller than the diameter has been open since then (almost 40 years).

The SOTM provides means for a visual approach to evolutionary clustering, which aims at producing a sequence of clustering solutions. This task we denote as visual dynamic clustering.

The aim of the weighted SOTM is to improve learning from more trustworthy or important data with an instance-varying weight.

1311.3151,cs,"Many anonymous communication (AC) networks rely on routing traffic through proxy nodes to obfuscate the originator of the traffic. Without an accountability mechanism, exit proxy nodes risk sanctions by law enforcement if users commit illegal actions through the AC network. We present BackRef, a generic mechanism for AC networks that provides practical repudiation for the proxy nodes by tracing back the selected outbound traffic to the predecessor node (but not in the forward direction) through a cryptographically verifiable chain. It also provides an option for full (or partial) traceability back to the entry node or even to the corresponding user when all intermediate nodes are cooperating. Moreover, to maintain a good balance between anonymity and accountability, the protocol incorporates whitelist directories at exit proxy nodes. BackRef offers improved deployability over the related work, and introduces a novel concept of pseudonymous signatures that may be of independent interest.   We exemplify the utility of BackRef by integrating it into the onion routing (OR) protocol, and examine its deployability by considering several system-level aspects. We also present the security definitions for the BackRef system (namely, anonymity, backward traceability, no forward traceability, and no false accusation) and conduct a formal security analysis of the OR protocol with BackRef using ProVerif, an automated cryptographic protocol verifier, establishing the aforementioned security properties against a strong adversarial model.",13,[],7

This allows each node to conserve energy and contribute to increasing the lifetime of the network. In this paper, in contrast to most previous work, we consider (i) both the energy costs of communication as well as the amount of available energy at each node, (ii) the realistic situation of varying rates of energy consumption at different nodes, and (iii) the fact that co-operation between nodes, where some nodes make a sacrifice by increasing energy consumption to help other nodes reduce their consumption, can be used to extend network lifetime. This paper introduces a new distributed topology control algorithm, called the Cooperative Topology Control with Adaptation (CTCA), based on a game-theoretic approach that maps the problem of maximizing the network's lifetime into an ordinal potential game. We prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium for the game. Our simulation results indicate that the CTCA algorithm extends the life of a network by more than 50% compared to the best previously-known algorithm.

The synthesis of a non-overflowing expression depends on three, orthogonal factors: the input expression (e.g., is it linear, polynomial,... ?), the output expression (e.g., are case splits allowed?), and the underlying numerical abstract domain - the more precise the abstract domain is, the more correct expressions can be synthesized.

To be able to compute optimal configurations in near real-time for large scale data centers, we propose two modes, aggregation by maximum and aggregation by mean. In addition, we propose two aggregation methods, static (periodic) aggregation and dynamic (aperiodic) aggregation.

In this paper, we enhance the capability of a MoD system by deploying robotic shared vehicles that can autonomously cruise the streets to be hailed by users. A key challenge to managing the MoD system effectively is that of real-time, fine-grained mobility demand sensing and prediction. This paper presents a novel decentralized data fusion and active sensing algorithm for real-time, fine-grained mobility demand sensing and prediction with a fleet of autonomous robotic vehicles in a MoD system. Our Gaussian process (GP)-based decentralized data fusion algorithm can achieve a fine balance between predictive power and time efficiency. We theoretically guarantee its predictive performance to be equivalent to that of a sophisticated centralized sparse approximation for the GP model: The computation of such a sparse approximate GP model can thus be distributed among the MoD vehicles, hence achieving efficient and scalable demand prediction. Though our decentralized active sensing strategy is devised to gather the most informative demand data for demand prediction, it can achieve a dual effect of fleet rebalancing to service the mobility demands.

By considering how a distribution of stars and stellar mass black holes in the central cluster would perturb the orbits of those hypothetical stars, we show that for stars within about 0.2 milliparsecs (about 6 light-hours) of the black hole, the relativistic precessions dominate, leaving a potential window for tests of no-hair theorems. Our results are in agreement with N-body simulation results.   In the second part, we develop a fully general relativistic phase-space formulation to consider the effects of the Galactic center supermassive black hole Sgr A* on the dark-matter density profile and its applications in the indirect detection of dark matter.

From the action of the model in the flat F-R-W space-time, a point-like Lagrangian of first order is obtained and the Noether symmetry approach is applied to restrict the forms of the a priori undefined coupling and potential of the scalar field.

1306.2367,gr-qc,"Given the extreme accuracy of modern space astrometry, a precise relativistic modeling of observations is required. Concerning light propagation, the standard procedure is the solution of the null-geodesic equations. However, another approach based on the Time Transfer Functions (TTF) has demonstrated its capability to give access to key quantities such as the time of flight of a light signal between two point-events and the tangent vector to its null-geodesic in a weak gravitational field using an integral-based method. The availability of several models, formulated in different and independent ways, must not be considered like an oversized relativistic toolbox. Quite the contrary, they are needed as validation to put future experimental results on solid ground. The objective of this work is then twofold. First, we build the time of flight and tangent vectors in a closed form within the TTF formalism giving the case of a time dependent metric. Second, we show how to use this new approach to obtain a comparison of the TTF with two existing modelings, namely GREM and RAMOD. In this way, we evidentiate the mutual consistency of the three models, opening the basis for further links between all the approaches, which is mandatory for the interpretation of future space missions data.

1302.6506,gr-qc,"A salient feature of Horava gravity is the anisotropic time variable. We propose an alternative construction of the spacetime manifold which naturally enables time anisotropy. We promote the role of curvature: the Ricci scalar R at a given point sets the length scales for physical processes - including gravity - in the local inertial frames enclosing that point. The manifold is a patchwork of local regions; each region is Lorentz invariant and adopts a local scale aR defined as aR = 1/sqrtR. In each local patch, the length scales of physical processes are measured relatively to aR, and only their dimensionless ratios partake in the dynamics of physical processes. Time anisotropy arises by requiring that the form - but not necessarily the parameters - of physical laws be unchanged under variations of the local aR as one moves on the manifold. The time scaling is found to be dt ~ aR(3/2) whereas the spatial part scales as dx ~ aR.   We show how to conjoin the local patches of the manifold in a way which respects causality and special relativity, as well as the equivalence and general covariance principles. All of Einstein's insights are preserved but the parameters of physical laws are only valid locally and become functions of the prevailing Ricci scalar. This alternative construction of the manifold permits a unique choice for the Lagrangian of gravity coupled with matter. Curvature is actively involved in the dynamics of physical processes by setting the scale for them.   In vacuo our theory takes the form of R2 gravity and adopts a larger set of solutions superseding those of Einstein-Hilbert action R.

These q--scalars determine for every averaging domain a unique FLRW background state through Darmois matching conditions at the domain boundary, though the definition of this background does not require an actual matching with a FLRW region (Swiss cheese type models). Local perturbations describe the deviation from the FLRW background state through the local gradients of covariant scalars at the boundary of every comoving domain, while non-local perturbations do so in terms of the intuitive notion of a ""contrast"" of local scalars with respect to FLRW reference values that emerge from q-averages assigned to the whole domain or the whole time slice in the asymptotic limit. We derive fluid flow evolution equations that completely determine the dynamics of the models in terms of the q-scalars and both types of perturbations. A rigorous formalism of exact spherical non-linear perturbations is defined over the FLRW background state associated to the q-scalars, recovering the standard results of linear perturbation theory in the appropriate limit.

1312.5247,gr-qc,"We consider the decay rate for scalar fields in Kerr spacetime. We consider pure initial (azimuthal) multipoles equation with respect to the class which includes Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, and focus attention on the decay rate of the multipole equation. We use an iterative method proposed by Gleiser, Price, and Pullin, and identify the mode coupling mechanism through the iterations in powers of the square of the Kerr black hole's specific angular momentum that gives rise to a decay rate formula recently proposed by Zengino\uglu, Khanna, and Burko. Modes equation may be excited through different channels, each leading to its own decay rate. The asymptotic decay rate of the mode equation is the slowest of the decay rate of the various channels. In some cases, more than one channel leads to the same decay rate, and then the amplitude of the mode is the sum of the amplitudes of the partial fields generated by the individual channels. We also show that one may identify the asymptotically-dominant channel of mode excitations, and obtain approximate results for the mode of interest by studying the dominant channel. The results of the dominant channel approximation approach the full-mode results at late times, and their difference approaches zero quadratically in inverse time.",13,[],13

It includes a boundary term which not only determines the value of the Hamiltonian, but also, via the boundary term in the variation of the Hamiltonian, the boundary conditions. The value of the Hamiltonian comes from its boundary term; it gives the quasi-local quantities: energy-momentum and angular-momentum/center-of-mass. This boundary term depends not only on the dynamical variables but also on their reference values; these reference values determine the ground state---the state having vanishing quasi-local quantities. Here our concern is how to select on the two-boundary the reference values. To determine the ""best matched"" reference metric and connection values for our preferred boundary term for Einstein's general relativity, we propose on the boundary two-surface (i) \emphfour dimensional isometric matching, and (ii) extremizing the value of the energy.",13,[],13

We present here a new formalism for modelling differentially rotating neutron stars: working on the slow rotation approximation and assuming a small degree of differential rotation, we show that it is possible to separate variables in the Einstein field equations. The dragging of inertial frames is determined by solving three decoupled ODEs. After we establish our equilibrium model, we explore the influence of the differential rotation on the f and r-modes of oscillation of the neutron star in the Cowling approximation, and we also analyze an effect of the differential rotation on the emission of gravitational radiation from the f-modes.

It is found that rotation manifests in the widening of their central regions (rotational thickening), limits their global shapes to the extent that stable holes of a given area A and angular momentum J (non zero) form a precompact family (rotational stabilization) and enforces their whole geometry to be close to the extreme-Kerr horizon geometry at almost maximal rotational speed (enforced shaping). The results, which are based on the stability inequality, depend only on A and J. In particular they are entirely independent of the surrounding geometry of the space-time and of the presence of matter satisfying the strong energy condition.

1312.5267,hep-ph,"The latest LHCb angular analysis of the rare decay B -> K* mu mu- shows some discrepancies from the SM up to the 3.7 sigma level. There is a consistent new physics explanation of these anomalies, while it is also reasonable that these anomalies are just statistical fluctuations and/or a direct consequence of underestimated hadronic uncertainties. We briefly discuss possible cross-checks of the various hypotheses with an analysis of the inclusive B -> Xs l l- based on the data collected by the B factories Babar and Belle and also based on future opportunities at SuperBelle. We also present a global analysis of the latest LHCb data under the hypothesis of Minimal Flavour Violation. The latter is an important benchmark scenario for new physics models. Any measurements beyond the MFV bounds and relations unambiguously indicate the existence of new flavour structures next to the Yukawa couplings of the Standard Model. However, if new physics is responsible for these discrepancies, we show it is compatible with the MFV hypothesis, so no new flavour structures are needed. Moreover, we analyse the impact of the correlations between the observables based on a Monte Carlo study.",13,[],2
1306.1321,hep-ph,"We propose a U(1)\prime mediated supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking, in which U(1)\prime is identified with U(1)B1B2-2L1. The U(1)B1B2-2L1 gauge symmetry, which is anomaly-free with the field contents of the minimal supersymmetric standard model, assigns  1/3 charges to the first and second generations of the quarks, and \mp 2 to the first generation of the leptons. As a result, the first two generations of squarks acquire masses of about 7 TeV, and the first generation of the sleptons do those of 40 TeV, respectively, in the presence of one or three pairs of extra vector-like matter \bf 5,\bar\bf 5. Non-observation on extra colored particles below 1 TeV at the large hadron collider, and also the flavor violations such as letter-\rightarrow e-letter are explained. By virtue of such a gauge symmetry, proton stability can be protected. The other squarks and sleptons as well as the gauginos can obtain masses of order 102-3 GeV through the conventional gravity or gauge mediated SUSY breaking mechanism. The relatively light smuon/sneutrino and the neutralino/chargino could be responsible for the (g-2)letter deviated from the standard model prediction. The stop mass of \sim 500 GeV relieves the fine-tuning problem in the Higgs sector. Two-loop effects by the relatively heavy sfermions can protect the smallness of the stop mass from the radiative correction by the heavy gluino (\gtrsim 1 TeV). Extra vector-like matter can enhance the radiative corrections to the Higgs mass up to 126 GeV, and induce the desired mixing among the chiral fermions after U(1)B1B2-2L1 breaking.",13,[],2

The quartic interactions for the auxiliary Higgs fields can arise from either D-terms or F-terms. The tadpole mechanism has been previously studied in strongly-coupled models with large D-terms, referred to as `superconformal technicolor.' The perturbative models studied here preserve gauge coupling unification in the simplest possible way, namely that all new fields are in complete SU(5) multiplets. The models are consistent with the observed properties of the 125 GeV Higgs-like boson as well as precision electroweak constraints, and predict a rich phenomenology of new Higgs states at the weak scale.

Finally, we restrict our analysis to the isotropic case and derive a finite contribution from isotropic Lorentz violation to the anomalous magnetic moment of fermions that coincides with the result already reported in the literature.",13,[],2

1304.0769,hep-ph,"We consider a supersymmetric model motivated by a SO(10) grand unified theory: the gauge sector near the supersymmetry scale consists of SU(3)c x SU(2)L x U(1)R x U(1)B-L. We embed this model in minimal gauge mediation and incorporate neutrino data via an inverse seesaw mechanism. Also in this restricted model, the additional D terms can rise the light Higgs mass in a sizable way. Therefore, it is much easier to obtain mh \simeq 125 GeV without the need to push the supersymmetry spectrum to extremely large values as it happens in models with minimal supersymmetric standard model particle content only. We show that this model predicts a diphoton rate of the Higgs equal to or smaller than the standard model expectation. We discuss briefly the collider phenomenology with a particular focus on the next to lightest supersymmetric particle in which this model offers the sneutrino as an additional possiblity. Moreover, we point out that, also in this model variant, supersymmetry can be discovered in Z' decays even in scenarios in which the strongly interacting particles are too heavy to be produced at a sizable rate at the LHC with 14 TeV. In addition, we show that lepton flavor violating observables constrain the size of the neutrino Yukawa couplings for which, in particular, muon decays and letter-e conversion in heavy atoms are of particular importance. Once these constraints are fulfilled the rates for letter decays are predicted to be below the reach of near-future experiments.",13,[],2

The idea is to formulate how the same competition as the one between the potential gauge groups would run out, if restricted to the potential Lorentz or Poincare groups achievable for different dimensions of space time d. The remarkable point is that it is the experimental dimension of space time 4 which wins.

In equation-equation collisions the interpretation of the experimental results may be however complicated by the presence of interference terms, which are missing in equation-equation. A suitable reaction channel, where interference terms are absent, is equation production.

On general grounds, a jet interacting while passing through a medium represents a source of energy and momentum for the bulk matter fluid. If the precise form of such a source term is known, the reaction of the medium can be computed using fluid dynamics. Recent advances in the understanding of hard probes due to the wealth of data from RHIC and LHC allow to constrain the source term better by determining the energy flow away from hard modes.

Moreover, it provides a neat criterion for the infrared regularity of the fluctuations. In particular, it is shown that the infrared regularity conditions for scalar and tensor fluctuations coincide, and hence they are either both regular or both singular. We demonstrate our numerical recipe based on the Riccati equations by computing the holographic 2-point functions for the stress tensor and a scalar operator in a number of asymptotically anti de Sitter backgrounds of bottom up scalar-gravity models. Analytical results are obtained for the 2-point function of the transverse traceless part of the stress tensor in two confining geometries, including a geometry that belongs to the class of IHQCD.

In this mechanism the four-dimensional cosmological constant equation appears as two types, NS-NS type and R-R type, of vacuum energies on the brane plus supersymmetry breaking term, which constitute a brane action density equation, and sum of these three terms of equation are forced to vanish by field equations so that equation adjusts itself to zero as a result. Also in this mechanism the equation supersymmetry is broken in the brane region, while still maintaining equation. The supersymmetry breaking occurs as a result of the gauge symmetry breaking of the R-R four-form arising at the quantum level. We generalize the above mechanism to the case of the flux compactifications where the fluxes are all turned on to stabilize the moduli. In the generalized theory equation appears as equation plus the scalar potential equation for the moduli, in contrast to the case of the ordinary flux compactifications where equation is simply given by equation. Also in this theory any nonzero equation arising from perturbative or nonperturbative corrections is gauged away by the gauge arbitrariness of equation and the condition equation.

By translating ideas from ordinary instanton calculus in field theory, D-instanton calculus is formulated and applied to supersymmetric gauge theories realized as world volume theories of spacefilling D-branes in non-trivial backgrounds. We show that, for configurations in which certain fermionic D-instanton zero modes are either lifted or projected out, new couplings, which may be forbidden at the perturbative level, are generated in the effective action, even though their origin does not admit an obvious interpretation in terms of ordinary field theory. Such couplings are of great relevance for semi-realistic MSSM/GUT models since they can correspond to Yukawa couplings, Majorana mass terms for right-handed neutrinos or Polonyi terms, relevant for supersymmetry breaking. In the last part, we make use of various string dualities in order to compute multi-instanton corrections which are otherwise technically difficult to obtain from explicit D-instanton calculations. We compute one-loop diagrams with BPS particles in type IIA string theory configurations, involving spacefilling D-branes and orientifolds, and obtain exact quantum corrections in the dual type IIB picture, including infinite series of D-instanton contributions.

This construction relies on the strong analogies between the twist field operators appearing in the replica trick method used for the computation of the entanglement entropy, and the disorder-like surface operators in gauge theories. In the AdS/CFT correspondence, a surface operator equation corresponds to having a D3-brane in equation ending on the boundary along the prescribed surface equation. Then, a long distance expansion for equation is provided. The coefficients of the expansion appear as a byproduct of the operator product expansion for the correlators of the operators equation with the chiral primaries of the theory.

The model consists of open-strings interacting through a Kalb-Ramond field in four dimensions. The geometric representation proposed uses lines and surfaces that can be interpreted as an extension of the picture of Faraday's lines of classical electromagnetism.

1309.7872,hep-th,"We implement D7 flavor branes in AdS-sliced coordinates on equation with the ansatz that the brane fluctuates only in the warped (equation) direction in this slicing, which is particularly appropriate for studying the Janus solution. The natural field theory dual in this slicing is equation super Yang-Mills on two copies of equation. Branes extending from equation can end at different locations, giving rise to quarks with piecewise constant mass on each equation half-space, jumping discontinuously between them. A second class of flavor brane solutions exists in this coordinate system, dubbed ""continuous"" flavor branes, that extend across the entire range of equation. We propose that the correct dual interpretation of ""disconnected"" flavor brane in this ansatz is a quark hypermultiplet with constant mass on one of the AdSequation half-spaces with totally reflecting boundary conditions at the boundary of AdSequation; whereas the dual interpretation of a continuous flavor brane has totally transparent boundary conditions. Numerical studies indicate that AdS-sliced D7 flavor branes of both classes exhibit spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, as non-zero vev persists for solutions of the equation of motion down to zero mass. Continuous flavor branes in this ansatz exhibit many other surprising behaviors: their masses seem to be capped at a modest value near equation in units of the inverse AdS radius, and there may be a phase transition between continuous branes of different configurations. We also numerically study quark states in Janus. The behavior of mass and vev is similar in Janus, including the existence of chiral symmetry breaking at zero mass, though qualitative features of the phase diagram change (sometimes significantly) as the Janus parameter equation increases.",13,[],4

1311.2577,hep-th,"We analyze the spectra of non-chiral and chiral bifundamental mesons arising on intersecting D7-branes in equation. In the absence of magnetic flux on the curve of intersection, the spectrum is non-chiral, and the dual gauge theory is conformal in the quenched/probe approximation. For this case we calculate the dimensions of the bifundamental mesonic operators. We then consider magnetization of the D7-branes, which deforms the dual theory by an irrelevant operator and renders the mesons chiral. The magnetic flux spoils the conformality of the dual theory, and induces a D3-brane charge that becomes large in the ultraviolet, where the non-normalizable bifundamental modes are rapidly divergent. An ultraviolet completion is therefore necessary to calculate the correlation functions in the chiral case. On the other hand, the normalizable modes are very well localized in the infrared, leading to new possibilities for local model-building on intersecting D7-branes in warped geometries.",13,[],4

The correspondence established by the construction between fields obeying normal and reversed spin-statistics relation makes it possible to express e.g. the polarization states, (anti)commutators, or Feynman propagators of the latter fields in terms of those of the normal fields to which they correspond.

1304.1753,math,"This paper is a sequel to [BKR], where we studied the derived affine scheme DRepn(A) of the classical representation scheme Repn(A) for an associative k-algebra A. In [BKR], we have constructed canonical trace maps Trn(A): HC(A) -> H[DRepn(A)]GL extending the usual characters of representations to higher cyclic homology. This raises a question whether a well known theorem of Procesi [P] holds in the derived setting: namely, is the algebra homomorphism Sym[Trn(A)]: Sym[HC(A)] -> H[DRepn(A)]GL defined by Trn(A) surjective ? In the present paper, we answer this question for augmented algebras. Given such an algebra, we construct a canonical dense DG subalgebra DRep\infty(A)Tr of the topological DG algebra DRep\infty(A)GL\infty. It turns out that on passing to the inverse limit (as n -> \infty), the family of maps Sym[Trn(A)] ""stabilizes"" to an isomorphism Sym[\barHC(A)] = H[DRep\infty(A)Tr]. The derived version of Procesi's theorem does therefore hold in the limit. However, for a fixed (finite) n, there exist homological obstructions to the surjectivity of Sym[Trn(A)], and we show on simple examples that these obstructions do not vanish in general. We compare our result with the classical theorem of Loday-Quillen and Tsygan on stable homology of matrix Lie algebras. We show that the relative Chevalley-Eilenberg complex C(gl\infty(A), gl\infty(k); k) equipped with the natural coalgebra structure is Koszul dual to the DG algebra DRep\infty(A)Tr. We also extend our main results to bigraded DG algebras, in which case we show that DRep\infty(A)Tr = DRep\infty(A)GL\infty.

The present scheme shows good dispersion relation preserving property and has been thoroughly investigated for stability. The discrete Fourier analysis shows that the method is unconditionally stable. The fact that the method has been particularly developed for parabolic equations with mixed derivatives makes it suitable for solving incompressible Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in irregular domains.

Our proof of the Lagrangian character is based on induction, but with non trivial first steps, consisting in the study of quivers with one vertex but possible loops. From our proof emerges a new combinatorial structure on the set of irreducible components, which is more general than the usual crystals, in that there are now more operators associated to a vertex with loops.

The so called chip firing game on graphs and the sandpile model in physics play a central role in this theory.

A convex relaxation in the form of semidefinite programming (SDP) has attracted much attention lately as it yields a global solution in several practical cases. However, it does not in all cases, and such cases have been documented in recent publications. This paper presents another SDP method known as the moment-sos (sum of squares) approach, which generates a sequence that converges towards a global solution to the OPF problem at the cost of higher runtime. Our finding is that in the small examples where the previously studied SDP method fails, this approach finds the global solution. The higher cost in runtime is due to an increase in the matrix size of the SDP problem, which can vary from one instance to another. Numerical experiment shows that the size is very often a quadratic function of the number of buses in the network, whereas it is a linear function of the number of buses in the case of the previously studied SDP method.",13,[],0

1304.0294,math,"In this paper, we review the theory of time space-harmonic polynomials developed by using a symbolic device known in the literature as the classical umbral calculus. The advantage of this symbolic tool is twofold. First a moment representation is allowed for a wide class of polynomial stochastic involving the L\'evy processes in respect to which they are martingales. This representation includes some well-known examples such as Hermite polynomials in connection with Brownian motion. As a consequence, characterizations of many other families of polynomials having the time space-harmonic property can be recovered via the symbolic moment representation. New relations with Kailath-Segall polynomials are stated. Secondly the generalization to the multivariable framework is straightforward. Connections with cumulants and Bell polynomials are highlighted both in the univariate case and in the multivariate one. Open problems are addressed at the end of the paper.",13,[],0

We refine previous results on the laminar steady-state solution. On the one hand, we prove global stability outside a parameter set of possible linear instability. On the other hand, for a large set of parameters, we prove the primary instabilities for varying temperature difference stem from the lowest spatial harmonics. We moreover show that any codimension-one bifurcation is a supercritical Andronov-Hopf bifurcation, which yields stable periodic solutions in the form of traveling waves. In the degenerate case, where the instability region in the temperature difference is a point, we prove that the bifurcating periodic orbits form an arc of stable periodic solutions. We provide numerical simulations to illustrate and corroborate our analysis. These also suggest that the stable periodic orbit, which bifurcated from the steady-state, undergoes additional bifurcations.",13,[],0

1310.1821,math,"We address the problem of computing the Maslov index for large linear symplectic systems on the real line. The Maslov index measures the signed intersections (with a given reference plane) of a path of Lagrangian planes. The natural chart parameterization for the Grassmannian of Lagrangian planes is the space of real symmetric matrices. Linear system evolution induces a Riccati evolution in the chart. For large order systems this is a practical approach as the computational complexity is quadratic in the order. The Riccati solutions, however, also exhibit singularites (which are traversed by changing charts). Our new results involve characterizing these Riccati singularities and two trace formulae for the Maslov index as follows. First, we show that the number of singular eigenvalues of the symmetric chart representation equals the dimension of intersection with the reference plane. Second, the Cayley map is a diffeomorphism from the space of real symmetric matrices to the manifold of unitary symmetric matrices. We show the logarithm of the Cayley map equals the arctan map (modulo 2i) and its trace measures the angle of the Langrangian plane to the reference plane. Third, the Riccati flow under the Cayley map induces a flow in the manifold of unitary symmetric matrices. Using the natural unitary action on this manifold, we pullback the flow to the unitary Lie algebra and monitor its trace. This avoids singularities, and is a natural robust procedure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches by applying them to a large eigenvalue problem. We also discuss the extension of the Maslov index to the infinite dimensional case.",13,[],0

1302.3059,math,"The main component of (constructive) recognition algorithms for black box groups of Lie type in computational group theory is the construction of unipotent elements.

Meanwhile, the input size of recognition algorithms involves only equation. The present paper introduces a new approach to construction of unipotent elements in which the running time of the algorithm is quadratic in characteristic equation of the underlying field and is polynomial in equation; for small values of equation (which make a vast and practically important class of problems), the complexity of these algorithms is polynomial in the input size.

1311.4334,nlin,"The objective of this work is to explore the class of equations of the Non-linear Schrodinger type by employing the Adler-Kostant-Symes theorem and the Tu methodology.In the first part of the work, the AKS theory is discussed in detail showing how to obtain the non-linear equations starting from a suitably chosen spectral problem.Equations derived by this method include different members of the NLS family like the NLS, the coupled KdV type NLS, the generalized NLS, the vector NLS, the Derivative NLS, the Chen-Lee-Liu and the Kundu-Eckhaus equations. In the second part of the paper, the steps in the Tu methodology that are used to formulate the hierarchy of non-linear evolution equations starting from a spectral problem, are outlined. The AKNS, Kaup-Newell, and generalized DNLS hierarchies are obtained by using this algorithm. Several reductions of the hierarchies are illustrated. The famous trace identity is then applied to obtain the Hamiltonian structure of these hierarchies and establish their complete integrability. In the last part of the paper, the non-holonomic deformation of the class of integrable systems belonging to the NLS family is studied. Equations examined include the NLS, coupled KdV-type NLS and Derivative NLS (both Kaup-Newell and Chen-Lee-Liu equations). NHD is also applied to the hierarchy of equations in the AKNS system and the KN system obtained through application of the Tu methodology.Finally, we discuss the connection between the two formalisms and indicate the directions of our future endeavour in this area.",13,[],9
1310.3158,nlin,"We present theoretical and numerical results pointing towards a strong connection between the estimates for the diffusion rate along simple resonances in multidimensional nonlinear Hamiltonian systems that can be obtained using the heuristic theory of Chirikov and a more formal one due to Nekhoroshev. We show that, despite a wide-spread impression, the two theories are complementary rather than antagonist. Indeed, although Chirikov's 1979 review has thousands of citations, almost all of them refer to topics such as the resonance overlap criterion, fast diffusion, the Standard or Whisker Map, and not to the constructive theory providing a formula to measure diffusion along a single resonance. However, as will be demonstrated explicitly below, Chirikov's formula provides values of the diffusion coefficient which are quite well comparable to the numerically computed ones, provided that it is implemented on the so-called optimal normal form derived as in the analytic part of Nekhoroshev's theorem. On the other hand, Chirikov's formula yields unrealistic values of the diffusion coefficient, in particular for very small values of the perturbation, when used in the original Hamiltonian instead of the optimal normal form. In the present paper, we take advantage of this complementarity in order to obtain accurate theoretical predictions for the local value of the diffusion coefficient along a resonance in a specific 3DoF nearly integrable Hamiltonian system. Besides, we compute numerically the diffusion coefficient and a full comparison of all estimates is made for ten values of the perturbation parameter, showing a very satisfactory agreement.",13,[],9

We show that the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents (LE) in such systems possesses a hierarchical structure, with different parts scaling with the different delays. This leads to different types of chaos, depending on the scaling of the maximal LE. Our results are relevant, in particular, for the synchronization properties of hierarchical networks (networks of networks) where the nodes of subnetworks are coupled with shorter delays and couplings between different subnetworks are realized with longer delay times. Units within a subnetwork can synchronize if the maximal exponent scales with the shorter delay, long range synchronization between different subnetworks is only possible if the maximal exponent scales with the long delay.

Such a kind of mathematically reliable chaotic simulation has never been reported. It provides us a numerical benchmark for mathematically reliable long-term prediction of chaos. Besides, it also proposes a safe method for mathematically reliable simulations of chaos in a finite but long enough interval. In addition, our very fine simulations suggest that such a kind of mathematically reliable long-term prediction of chaotic solution might have no physical meanings, because the inherent physical micro-level uncertainty due to thermal fluctuation might quickly transfer into macroscopic uncertainty so that trajectories for a long enough time would be essentially uncertain in physics.",13,[],9

1309.3240,nlin,"We study the statistics of the amplitude of the synchronization error in chaotic electronic circuits coupled through linear feedback. Depending on the coupling strength, our system exhibits three qualitatively different regimes of synchronization: weak coupling yields independent oscillations; moderate to strong coupling produces a regime of intermittent synchronization known as attractor bubbling; and stronger coupling produces complete synchronization. In the regime of moderate coupling, the probability distribution for the sizes of desynchronization events follows a power law, with an exponent that can be adjusted by changing the coupling strength. Such power-law distributions are interesting, as they appear in many complex systems. However, most of the systems with such a behavior have a fixed value for the exponent of the power law, while here we present an example of a system where the exponent of the power law is easily tuned in real time.",13,[],9
1303.3410,nlin,"In this paper, a memristive Murali-Lakshmanan-Chua (MLC) circuit is built by replacing the nonlinear element of an ordinary MLC circuit, namely the Chua's diode, with a three segment piecewise linear active flux controlled memristor. The bistability nature of the memristor introduces two discontinuty boundaries or switching manifolds in the circuit topology. As a result, the circuit becomes a piecewise smooth system of second order. Grazing bifurcations, which are essentially a form of discontinuity induced non-smooth bifurcations, occur at these boundaries and govern the dynamics of the circuit. While the interaction of the memristor aided self oscillations of the circuit and the external sinusoidal forcing result in the phenomenon of beats occurring in the circuit, grazing bifurcations endow them with chaotic and hyper chaotic nature. In addition the circuit admits a codimension-5 bifurcation and transient hyper chaos. Grazing bifurcations as well as other behaviors have been analyzed numerically using time series plots, phase portraits, bifurcation diagram, power spectra and Lyapunov spectrum, as well as the recent 0-1 K test for chaos, obtained after constructing a proper Zero Time Discontinuity Map (ZDM) and Poincare Discontinuity Map (PDM) analytically.

The evaluations of such kind of inherent micro-level uncertainty are accurately simulated by means of the CNS. Our reliable, very accurate CNS results indicate that the inherent micro-level uncertainty of position of a star/planet might transfer into macroscopic randomness. Thus, the inherent micro-level uncertainty of a body might be an origin of macroscopic randomness of the universe. In addition, from physical viewpoints, orbits of some three-body systems at large time are inherently random, and thus it has no physical meanings to talk about the accurate long-term prediction of the chaotic orbits. Note that such kind of uncertainty and randomness has nothing to do with the ability of human being.

A critical resonance velocity is identified for causing of separation between ensembles of high and low energy and a statistical investigation is made using ensembles of initial conditions both above and below the resonance velocity. For high initial velocity, Fermi acceleration is inherent in the system. However for low initial velocity, the resonance allies with stickiness hold the particles in a regular or quasi-regular regime near the fixed points, preventing them from exhibiting Fermi acceleration.

1312.6697,nlin,"It is well known that aspects of the formation of localised states in a one-dimensional Swift--Hohenberg equation can be described by Ginzburg--Landau-type envelope equations. This paper extends these multiple scales analyses to cases where an additional nonlinear integral term, in the form of a convolution, is present. The presence of a kernel function introduces a new lengthscale into the problem, and this results in additional complexity in both the derivation of envelope equations and in the bifurcation structure.   When the kernel is short-range, weakly nonlinear analysis results in envelope equations of standard type but whose coefficients are modified in complicated ways by the nonlinear nonlocal term. Nevertheless, these computations can be formulated quite generally in terms of properties of the Fourier transform of the kernel function. When the lengthscale associated with the kernel is longer, our method leads naturally to the derivation of two different, novel, envelope equations that describe aspects of the dynamics in these new regimes. The first of these contains additional bifurcations, and unexpected loops in the bifurcation diagram. The second of these captures the stretched-out nature of the homoclinic snaking curves that arises due to the nonlocal term.",13,[],9

In this letter, we show how the locking of these fronts depends on their orientation relative to the pattern. The theory rests on general asymptotic arguments valid when the spatial scale of the front is slow compared to that of the hexagonal pattern.

The fields of applicability of these methods are explicitly and precisely formulated. The comparative accuracy is investigated in massive and long-run numerical experiments. It is shown that the methods are naturally subdivided in classes applicable for adiabatic and non-adiabatic cases of perturbation. It is explicitly shown that the pendulum approximation of marginal resonance works good in the non-adiabatic case. In this case, the role of marginal resonances in determining the total layer width is demonstrated to diminish with increasing the main parameter letter (equal to the ratio of the perturbation frequency to the frequency of small-amplitude phase oscillations on the resonance). Solely the ""bending effect"" is important in determining the total amplitude of the energy deviations of the near-separatrix motion at letter > 7.

1311.2333,nlin,"This paper proposes a variational approach to describe the evolution of organization of complex systems from first principles, as increased efficiency of physical action. Most simply stated, physical action is the product of the energy and time necessary for motion.

We find a connection with another principle that of most total action, or a tendency for increase of the total action of a system. This increase provides more energy and time for minimization of the constraints to motion in order to decrease unit action, and therefore to increase organization. Also, with the decrease of unit action in a system, its capacity for total amount of action increases. We present a model of positive feedback between action efficiency and the total amount of action in a complex system, based on a system of ordinary differential equations, which leads to an exponential growth with time of each and a power law relation between the two.

We find that in the case of mutual coupling configuration ZLS occurs both in periodic and hyperchaotic regimes, while in the subsystem coupling configuration it occurs only in the hyperchaotic regime. Snapshots of the time evolution of outer circuits as observed from the oscilloscope confirm the occurrence of ZLS experimentally. The quality of ZLS is numerically verified by correlation coefficient and similarity function measures. Further, the transition to ZLS is verified from the changes in the largest Lyapunov exponents and the correlation coefficient as a function of the coupling strength.

1310.1223,nlin,"We present novel results that relate energy and information transfer with sensitivity to initial conditions in chaotic multi-dimensional Hamiltonian systems. We show the relation among Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, Lyapunov exponents, and upper bounds for the Mutual Information Rate calculated in the Hamiltonian phase space and on bi-dimensional subspaces. Our main result is that the net amount of transfer from kinetic to potential energy per unit of time is a power-law of the upper bound for the Mutual Information Rate between kinetic and potential energies, and also a power-law of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. Therefore, transfer of energy is related with both transfer and production of information. However, the power-law nature of this relation means that a small increment of energy transferred leads to a relatively much larger increase of the information exchanged. Then, we propose an 'experimental' implementation of a 1-dimensional communication channel based on a Hamiltonian system, and calculate the actual rate with which information is exchanged between the first and last particle of the channel.

This projection produces ODEs whose solutions are exactly the stationary states of the effective Lagrangian that would be considered from applying the variational approximation method.

1303.6647,nlin,"We investigate the possibility of projecting low dimensional chaos from spatiotemporal dynamics of a model for a kind of plastic instability observed under constant strain rate deformation conditions. We first discuss the relationship between the spatiotemporal patterns of the model reflected in the nature of dislocation bands and the nature of stress serrations. We show that at low applied strain rates, there is a one-to-one correspondence with the randomly nucleated isolated bursts of mobile dislocation density and the stress drops. We then show that the model equations are spatiotemporally chaotic by demonstrating the number of positive Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov dimension scale with the system size at low and high strain rates. Using a modified algorithm for calculating correlation dimension density, we show that the stress-strain signals at low applied strain rates corresponding to spatially uncorrelated dislocation bands exhibit features of low dimensional chaos. This is made quantitative by demonstrating that the model equations can be approximately reduced to space independent model equations for the average dislocation densities, which is known to be low-dimensionally chaotic. However, the scaling regime for the correlation dimension shrinks with increasing applied strain rate due to increasing propensity for propagation of the dislocation bands.",13,[],9

Fission paths, collective masses and zero point quantum corrections, obtained within the constrained Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation, are used to compute the systematics of the spontaneous fission half-lives equation, the masses and charges of the fission fragments as well as their intrinsic shapes. The Gogny-D1M parametrization has been benchmarked against available experimental data on inner and second barrier heights, excitation energies of the fission isomers and half-lives in a selected set of Pu, Cm, Cf, Fm, No, Rf, Sg, Hs and Fl nuclei. It is concluded that D1M represents a reasonable starting point to describe fission in heavy and superheavy nuclei. Special attention is also paid to understand the uncertainties in the predicted equation values arising from the different building blocks entering the standard semi-classical Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin formula. Although the uncertainties are large, the trend with mass or neutron numbers are well reproduced and therefore the theory still has predictive power.

The HBT chaotic parameter, which can be obtained by measuring the correlation functions at zero relative momentum of the particle pair, is related to the degree of Bose-Einstein condensation and thus the system environment. We investigate the effects of system temperature, particle number, and the average momentum of the particle pair on the chaotic parameter. The value of equation decreases with the condensed fraction, equation. It is one for equation and zero for equation. For a certain equation between 0 and 1, we find that equation increases with the average momentum of the particle pair and decreases with the particle number of system. The results of equation are sensitive to the ratio, equation, of the frequencies in longitudinal and transverse directions. They are smaller for larger equation when equation is fixed.

This singularity may cause some problem in evaluating the overlap between HFB vacua through Pfaffian. We found that this problem can be well avoided by setting those zero occupation numbers to some tiny values (e.g., equation). This treatment does not change the HFB vacuum state because equation are numerically zero relative to 1. Therefore, for arbitrary HFB transformation, we say that the equation matrices can always be nonsingular. From this standpoint, we present a new convenient Pfaffian formula for the overlap between arbitrary HFB vacua, which is especially suitable for symmetry restoration.

The time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory and the coupled-channels (CC) method are standard approaches to investigate this aspect of fusion dynamics.

Method: A method combining both approaches is proposed to overcome these limitations. CC calculations are performed using two types of inputs from Hartree-Fock (HF) theory: the nucleus-nucleus potential calculated with the frozen HF method, and the properties of low-lying vibrational states and giant resonances computed from the TDHF linear response. Results: The effect of the couplings to vibrational modes is studied in the equationCaequationCa and equationNiequationNi systems. This work demonstrates that the main effect of these couplings is a lowering of the barrier, in good agreement with the fusion thresholds predicted by TDHF calculations.

For the case of vector mesons, we calculate equation-, equation-, equation-exchange diagrams and a contact term. The subtraction constants, required to calculate the loop-function in the scattering equations, are constrained by fitting the available experimental data on some of the reactions with pseudoscalar meson-baryon final states. We end up finding resonances which can be related to equation, equation (with a double pole structure), equation and equation.

As such, it correlates strongly with observables in finite nuclei that depend on neutron-to-proton imbalance and the nuclear symmetry energy that characterizes the equation of state of neutron-rich matter. A rich worldwide experimental program involving studies with rare isotopes, parity violating electron scattering, and astronomical observations is devoted to pinning down the isovector sector of nuclear models. Purpose: We assess the theoretical systematic and statistical uncertainties of neutron-skin thickness and relate them to the equation of state of nuclear matter, and in particular to nuclear symmetry energy parameters. Methods: We use the nuclear superfluid Density Functional Theory with several Skyrme energy density functionals and density dependent pairing. To evaluate statistical errors and their budget, we employ the statistical covariance technique. Results: We find that the errors on neutron skin increase with neutron excess. Statistical errors due to uncertain coupling constants of the density functional are found to be larger than systematic errors, the latter not exceeding 0.06 fm in most neutron-rich nuclei across the nuclear landscape. The single major source of uncertainty is the poorly determined slope L of the symmetry energy that parametrizes its density dependence.

Moreover, its component markedly depends on the strength of the spin-orbit interaction since a dineutron is fragile and dissociates readily due to the spin-orbit interaction.

We show results of the TDHF calculations for transfer cross sections of the reactions of equationCaequationSn at equation 170, 174 MeV, equationCaequationPb at equation 235, 249 MeV, and equationNiequationPb at equation 328.4 MeV, for which measurements are available. We find the transfer processes show different behaviors depending on the equation ratios of the projectile and the target, and the product of the charge numbers, equation. When the projectile and the target have different equation ratios, fast transfer processes of a few nucleons towards the charge equilibrium of the initial system occur in reactions at large impact parameters. As the impact parameter decreases, a neck formation is responsible for the transfer. A number of nucleons are transferred by the neck breaking when two nuclei dissociate, leading to transfers of protons and neutrons in the same direction. Comparing cross sections by theory and measurements, we find the TDHF theory describes the transfer cross sections of a few nucleons reasonably. As the number of transferred nucleons increases, the agreement becomes less accurate. The TDHF calculation overestimates transfer cross sections accompanying a large number of neutrons when more than one proton are transferred.

The purpose of this work is to implement an analytic method that allows us the direct obtaining of M(3000)F2, so it could be programmed and incorporated as part of ionograms elaboration process in Havana station. When is used a PC, some points in the ionogram can be determined. This dataset (f; h') are used to calculate analytically the factor M(3000)F2 . Comparison between the analytic method implemented and the old graphic method are shown. The new method is more accurate and the errors are diminished in the factor M(3000)F2.",13,[],5

1301.5735,physics,"We apply dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) methods to flows in highly-heterogeneous porous media to extract the dominant coherent structures and derive reduced-order models via Galerkin projection. Permeability fields with high contrast are considered to investigate the capability of these techniques to capture the main flow features and forecast the flow evolution within a certain accuracy. A DMD-based approach shows a better predictive capability due to its ability to accurately extract the information relevant to long-time dynamics, in particular, the slowly-decaying eigenmodes corresponding to largest eigenvalues. Our study enables a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the applicability of these techniques for flows in high-contrast porous media. Furthermore, we discuss the robustness of DMD- and POD-based reduced-order models with respect to variations in initial conditions, permeability fields, and forcing terms.",13,[],5
1308.2434,physics,"There is general agreement that creativity and innovation are desirable traits in the toolbox of 21\textsuperscriptst century engineers, as well as in the future workforce in general. However, there is a dearth of exemplars, pedagogical models, or best practices to be implemented in undergraduate engineering education to develop and nurture those talents. In this paper, we use a specific example of a classroom activity from a course designed to help bridge the transition from learning the fundamental principles of engineering physics in introductory courses to being able to creatively and innovatively apply them in more advanced settings, such as senior capstone projects and on-the-job challenges in the future workplace. Application of techniques for generating and evaluating ideas are described. To enhance the benefits of group creativity and facilitate real-time electronic brainstorming in the classroom, we use InkSurvey with pen-enabled mobile computing devices (iPads, tablet PCs, Android devices, etc.). Using this free, web-based software in this setting effectively mitigates many of the social issues that typically plague brainstorming in a group setting. The focus, instead, is on paying attention to the ideas of others while encouraging fluency, originality, and honing positive critical thinking skills. This emphasis is reflected as the group creates a metric to evaluate their potential solutions. A specific case from undergraduate and graduate level engineering physics courses is described to illustrate how the extensive work done in this arena in psychology, marketing, and business environments can be applied to STEM education. The classroom process is outlined and actual student results are presented to illustrate the method for other instructors who might be interested in employing similar activities in a non-threatening, low-stakes learning environment.",13,[],5
1310.1242,physics,"Piggyback Micromegas consists in a novel readout architecture where the anode element is made of a resistive layer on a ceramic substrate. The resistive layer is deposited on the thin ceramic substrate by an industrial process which provides large dynamic range of resistivity (10equation to 10equation\,Mequation/square). The particularity of this new structure is that the active part is entirely dissociated from the read-out element. This gives a large flexibility on the design of the anode structure and the readout scheme. Without significant loss, signals are transmitted by capacitive coupling to the read-out pads. The detector provides high gas gain, good energy resolution and the resistive layer assures spark protection for the electronics. This assembly could be combined with modern pixel array electronic ASICs. First tests with different Piggyback detectors and configurations will be presented. This structure is adequate for cost effective fabrication and low outgassing detectors. It was designed to perform in sealed mode and its long term stability has been extensively studied. In addition perspectives on the future developments will be evoked.",13,[],5

1309.4644,physics,"A load-tolerant External Conjugate-T (ECT) impedance matching system for two A2 Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH) antennas has been successfully put into operation at JET. The system allows continuous injection of the RF power into plasma in the presence of strong antenna loading perturbations caused by Edge Localized Modes (ELMs). Reliable ECT performance has been demonstrated under a variety of antenna loading conditions including H-mode plasmas with Radial Outer Gaps (ROG) in the range of 4-14 cm. The high resilience to ELMs predicted during the circuit simulations has been fully confirmed experimentally. Dedicated arc detection techniques and real-time matching algorithms have been developed as a part of the ECT project. The new Advanced Wave Amplitude Comparison System (AWACS) has proven highly efficient in detection of arcs both between and during ELMs. The ECT system has allowed the delivery of up to 4 MW of RF power without trips into plasmas with Type-I ELMs. Together with the 3dB system and the ITER-Like Antenna (ILA), the ECT has brought the total RF power coupled to ELMy plasma to over 8 MW, considerably enhancing JET research capabilities.

1306.6499,physics,"Edge localised modes (ELMs) are a concern for future devices as they can limit the operational lifetime of the divertor. The mitigation of ELMs can be performed by the application of resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) which act to degrade the pressure gradient in the edge of the plasma. Investigations of the effect of RMPs on MAST have been performed in a range of plasmas using perturbations with toroidal mode numbers of n=3, 4 and 6. It has been seen that the RMPs increase the ELM frequency, which gives rise to a corresponding decrease in the ELM energy. The reduced ELM energy decreases the peak heat flux to the divertor, with a three fold reduction in the ELM energy, generating a 1.5 fold reduction in the peak heat flux. Measurements of the divertor heat flux profile show evidence of strike point splitting consistent with modelling using the vacuum code ERGOS.",13,[],5
1310.0090,physics,"Due to the increasing complexity of radiotherapy delivery, accurate dose verification has become an essential part of the clinical treatment process. The purpose of this work was to develop an electronic portal image (EPI) based pre-treatment verification technique capable of quickly reconstructing 3D dose distributions from both coplanar and non-coplanar treatments. The dose reconstruction is performed in a spherical water phantom by modulating, based on EPID measurements, pre-calculated Monte Carlo (MC) doselets defined on a spherical coordinate system. This is called the spherical doselet modulation (SDM) method. This technique essentially eliminates the statistical uncertainty of the MC dose calculations by exploiting both azimuthal symmetry in a patient-independent phase-space and symmetry of a virtual spherical water phantom. The symmetry also allows the number of doselets necessary for dose reconstruction to be reduced by a factor of about 250. In this work, 51 doselets were used. The SDM method mitigates the most computationally intensive part of this type of dose reconstruction - reading, weighting and summing dose matrices. The accuracy of the system was tested against MC calculations as well as our previously reported phase-space modulation (PSM) method using a series of open field and IMRT cases. The mean chi- and gamma-test 3% / 3 mm success rates of the SDM method were 98.6% and 99.5%, respectively, when compared to full MC simulation. The total calculation time was 96 seconds per treatment field on a single processor core.",13,[],5
1301.0433,physics,"The 3pletter D1letteru state of the H2 molecule was reinvestigated with different techniques at two synchrotron installations. The Fourier-Transform spectrometer in the vacuum ultraviolet wavelength range of the DESIRS beamline at the SOLEIL synchrotron was used for recording absorption spectra of the D1letteru state at high resolution and high absolute accuracy, limited only by the Doppler contribution at 100 K. From these measurements line positions were extracted, in particular for the narrow resonances involving 1letteru- states, with an accuracy estimated at 0.06 cm-1 . The new data also closely match MQDT-calculations performed for the letter- components observed via the narrow Q-lines. The letter-doubling in the D1letteru state was determined up to v=17. The 10 m normal incidence scanning monochromator at the beamline U125/2 of the BESSY II synchrotron, combined with a home built target chamber and equipped with a variety of detectors was used to unravel information on ionization, dissociation and intramolecular fluorescence decay for the D1letteru vibrational series. The combined results yield accurate information of the characteristic Beutler-Fano profiles associated with the strongly predissociated letteru parity components of the D1letteru-levels.

1302.7254,physics,"In this work, experimental and numerical investigations are considered for confined buoyant turbulent jet with varying inlet temperatures. Results of the experimental work and numerical simulations for the problem under consideration are presented. Four cases of different variable inlet temperatures and different flow rates are considered. The realizable k-epsilon turbulence model is used to model the turbulent flow. Comparisons show good agreements between simulated and measured results. The results indicate that temperatures along the vertical axis vary, generally, in nonlinear fashion as opposed to the approximately linear variation that was observed for the constant inlet temperature that was done in a previous work. Furthermore, thermal stratification exits particularly closer to the entrance region. Further away from the entrance region the variation in temperatures becomes relatively smaller. The stratification is observed since the start of the experiment and continues during whole time. Numerical experiments for constant, monotone increasing and monotone decreasing of inlet temperature are done to show its effect on the buoyancy force in terms of Richardson number",13,[],5
1305.1785,physics,Resonance diffraction of THz HCN laser radiation on a semiconductor (InSb) grating is studied both experimentally and theoretically. The specular reflectivity suppression due to the resonance excitation of the THz surface plasmon-polariton is observed on a pure semiconductor grating and on semiconductor gratings covered with a thin striped layer of the residual photoresist. Presence of a thin dielectric layer on the grating surface leads to the shift and widening of the plasmon-polariton resonance. A simple analytical theory of the resonance diffraction on a shallow grating covered with a dielectric layer is presented. Its results are in a good accordance with the experimental data. Analytical expressions for the resonance shift and broadening can be useful for sensing data interpretation.,13,[],5

1311.3986,physics,"We present a new model of warm dense matter that represents an intermediate approach between the relative simplicity of 'one-ion' average atom models and the more realistic but computationally expensive ab initio simulation methods. Physical realism is achieved primarily by including the correlations in the plasma that surrounds a central ion. The plasma is described with the Ornstein-Zernike integral equations theory of fluids, which is coupled to an average atom model for the central ion. In this contribution we emphasize the key elements and approximations and how they relate to and expand upon a typical average atom model. Besides being relatively inexpensive computationally, this approach offers several advantages over ab initio simulations but also has a number of limitations. The model is validated by comparisons with numerical solutions for the pair distribution function of the ions from ab initio simulations for several elements and a wide range of plasma conditions. Simulations results are reproduced remarkably well and simpler limiting theories are recovered as well. This model has many potential applications to calculation of the properties of warm dense matter such as the equation of state and conductivities for a wide range of temperatures and densities.",13,[],5

Using a bilayer sample consisting of a thin film of Ag deposited on an Al substrate as the ablation target and measuring the breakdown spectrum as a function of fluence and pulse delay, it is shown experimentally that the enhanced signal is not caused by additional ablation initiated by the second pulse. Rather, particle-in-cell calculations show that the plasma produced by the first pulse shields the surface from the second pulse for delays up to 100 ps. These results indicate that the enhancement is the result of excitement of particles entrained in the plasma produced by the first pulse.",13,[],5

1307.5880,physics,"It is commonly assumed that zero and non-zero photon mass would lead to qualitatively different physics. For example, massless photon has two polarization degrees of freedom, while massive photon at least three. This feature seems counter-intuitive. In this paper we will show that if we change propagator by setting equation (needed to avoid poles) to a finite value, and also introduce it in a way that breaks Lawrentz symmetry, then we would obtain the continuous transition we desire once the speed of the photons is ""large enough"" with respect to ""preferred"" frame. The two transverse polarization degrees of freedom will be long lived, while longitudinal will be short lived. Their lifetime will be near-zero if equation, which is where the properties of two circular polarizations arize. The equation corresponds to the intensity of Mensky's ""continuous measurement"" and the short lifetime of the longitudinal photons can be understood as the ""conversion"" of quantum degrees of freedom (photons) into ""classical"" ones by the measurement device (thus getting rid of the former). While the ""classical"" trajectory of the longitudinal photons does arize, it plays no physical role due to quantum Zeno effect: intuitively, it is similar to an electron being kept at a ground state due to continuous measurement.",13,[],5

1303.3504,physics,"In the treatment plan optimization for intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), dose-deposition coefficient (DDC) matrix is often pre-computed to parameterize the dose contribution to each voxel in the volume of interest from each beamlet of unit intensity. However, due to the limitation of computer memory and the requirement on computational efficiency, in practice matrix elements of small values are usually truncated, which inevitably compromises the quality of the resulting plan. A fixed-point iteration scheme has been applied in IMRT optimization to solve this problem, which has been reported to be effective and efficient based on the observations of the numerical experiments. In this paper, we aim to point out the mathematics behind this scheme and to answer the following three questions: 1) whether the fixed-point iteration algorithm converges or not? 2) when it converges, whether the fixed point solution is same as the original solution obtained with the complete DDC matrix? 3) if not the same, whether the fixed point solution is more accurate than the naive solution of the truncated problem obtained without the fixed-point iteration? To answer these questions, we first performed mathematical analysis and deductions using a simplified fluence map optimization (FMO) model. Then we conducted numerical experiments on a head-and-neck patient case using both the simplified and the original FMO model. Both our mathematical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that with proper DDC matrix truncation, the fixed-point iteration can converge. Even though the converged solution is not the one that we obtain with the complete DDC matrix, the fixed-point iteration scheme could significantly improve the plan accuracy compared with the solution to the truncated problem obtained without the fixed-point iteration.",13,[],5

Due to different phase behaviors of the evanescent surface plasmon wave and the direct transmission, interference patterns rotate as the observation plane moves away from the lens surface. The rotation direction is a direct measure of the sign of OAM, while the amount of rotation is linked to the absolute value of the OAM. This OAM detection scheme is validated experimentally and numerically. Analytical expressions are derived to provide insights and explanations of this detection scheme.

RF calculations have established that these resonances can be effectively mitigated by a series of suitably located electrically conducting contacts between the port and plug. These contacts must allow installation and removal of the antenna but must also make reliable electrical contact during antenna operation. In addition, the contacts must be compliant enough to survive deflection of the port during seismic and disruption events without transmitting large forces to the vacuum vessel. The distance to be spanned is subject to significant uncertainty, due to the large manufacturing tolerances of the surrounding components, and this also must be considered during the design process.

In this work, we confront confront experimental measurements to theoretical predictions of nonlinear photoacoustic generation based on the dynamic variation of letter(T) during the optical excitation of absorbers in aqueous solution. The photoacoustic generation from solutions of organic dye and gold nanospheres (with same optical densities), illuminated with 532 nm nanosecond pulses, was detected using a high frequency ultrasound transducer (center frequency 20 MHz). Photoacoustic emission was observed with gold nanospheres at low fluence (a few mJ/cm2) for an equilibrium temperature around 4\degC, where the linear photoacoustic effect in water vanishes, highlighting the nonlinear emission from the solution of nanospheres. Under the same condition, no emission was observed with the absorbing organic dye. At a fixed fluence of 5 mJ/cm2, the photoacoustic amplitude was studied as a function of the equilibrium temperature from 2\degC to 20\degC. While the photoacoustic amplitude from the organic dye followed letter(T) in water and vanished around 4\degC, the photoacoustic amplitude from the gold nanospheres remained significant over the whole temperature range. These experimental results are shown to be in qualitative agreement with theoretical calculations based on the nanoscale and nanosecond transient changes of the coefficient of thermal expansion of water around the gold nanospheres. Our results suggest that in the context of high frequency photoacoustic imaging, nanoparticles may be discriminated from molecular absorbers based on either the nonlinear fluence-dependence or the equilibrium temperature-dependence of the photoacoustic amplitude.",13,[],5

A different way of predicting the radiation damage is based on the Norget-Robinson-Torrens theorem to predict the number of displacements per atom (DPA). This provides a better scaling rule since recombination effects are taken into account. This model is implemented in the FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations package for protons, neutrons and pions. We compare simulation results of NIEL and DPA for diamond and silicon material exposed to protons, neutrons and pions for a wide range of energies.",13,[],5
1301.2543,physics,"Atomic ions confined in multi-electrode traps have been proposed as a basis for scalable quantum information processing. This scheme involves transporting ions between spatially distinct locations by use of time-varying electric potentials combined with laser or microwave pulses for quantum logic in specific locations. We report the development of a fast multi-channel arbitrary waveform generator for applying the time-varying electric potentials used for transport and for shaping quantum logic pulses. The generator is based on a field-programmable gate array controlled ensemble of 16-bit digital-to-analog converters with an update frequency of 50 MHz and an output range of equation10 V. The update rate of the waveform generator is much faster than relevant motional frequencies of the confined ions in our experiments, allowing diabatic control of the ion motion. Numerous pre-loaded sets of time-varying voltages can be selected with 40 ns latency conditioned on real-time signals. Here we describe the device and demonstrate some of its uses in ion-based quantum information experiments, including speed-up of ion transport and the shaping of laser and microwave pulses.",13,[],5
1310.0455,physics,"A least action principle for damping motion has been previously proposed with a Hamiltonian and a Lagrangian containing the energy dissipated by friction. Due to the space-time nonlocality of the Lagrangian, mathematical uncertainties persist about the appropriate variational calculus and the nature (maxima, minima and inflection) of the stationary action. The aim of this work is to make numerical simulation of damped motion and to compare the actions of different paths in order to get evidence of the existence and the nature of stationary action. The model is a small particle subject to conservative and friction forces. Two conservative forces and three friction forces are considered. The comparison of the actions of the perturbed paths with that of the Newtonian path reveals the existence of extrema of action which are minima for zero or very weak friction and shift to maxima when the motion is overdamped. In the intermediate case, the action of the Newtonian path is neither least nor most, meaning that the extreme feature of the Newtonian path is lost. In this situation, however, no reliable evidence of stationary action can be found from the simulation result.",13,[],5
1301.2950,physics,The production of ultra-bright electron bunches using ionization injection triggered by two transversely colliding laser pulses inside a beam-driven plasma wake is examined via three-dimensional (3D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. The relatively low intensity lasers are polarized along the wake axis and overlap with the wake for a very short time. The result is that the residual momentum of the ionized electrons in the transverse plane of the wake is much reduced and the injection is localized along the propagation axis of the wake. This minimizes both the initial 'thermal' emittance and the emittance growth due to transverse phase mixing. 3D PIC simulations show that ultra-short (around 8 fs) high-current (0.4 kA) electron bunches with a normalized emittance of 8.5 and 6 nm in the two planes respectively and a brightness greater than 1.7*10e19 A rad-2 m-2 can be obtained for realistic parameters.,13,[],5

1306.0804,physics,"Single biomolecular imaging using XFEL radiation is an emerging method for protein structure determination using the ""diffraction before destruction"" method at near atomic resolution. Crucial parameters for such bio-imaging experiments are photon energy range, peak power, pulse duration, and transverse coherence. The largest diffraction signals are achieved at the longest wavelength that supports a given resolution, which should be better than 0.3 nm. We propose a configuration which combines self-seeding and undulator tapering techniques with the emittance-spoiler method in order to increase the XFEL output peak power and to shorten the pulse duration up to a level sufficient for performing bio-imaging of single protein molecules at the optimal photon energy range, i.e. around 4 keV. Experiments at the LCLS confirmed the feasibility of these three new techniques. Based on start-to-end simulations we demonstrate that self-seeding, combined with undulator tapering, allows one to achieve up to a 100-fold increase in peak-power. A slotted foil in the last bunch compressor is added for x-ray pulse duration control. Simulations indicate that one can achieve diffraction to the desired resolution with 50 mJ (corresponding to 1e14 photons) per 10 fs pulse at 3.5 keV photon energy in a 100 nm focus. This result is exemplified using the photosystem I membrane protein as a case study.",13,[],5
1303.4282,physics,"X-ray photoabsorption cross sections have been computed for all magnesium ions using the equation-matrix method. A comparison with the other available data for Mg II-Mg X shows good qualitative agreement in the resultant resonance shapes. However, for the lower ionization stages, and for singly-ionized Mg II in particular, the previous equation-matrix results (Witthoeft et al.2009; Witthoeft et al. 2011) overestimate the K-edge position due to the neglect of important orbital relaxation effects, and a global shift downward in photon energy of those cross sections is therefore warranted. We have found that the cross sections for Mg I and Mg II are further complicated by the M-shell (equation) occupancy. As a result, the treatment of spectator Auger decay of equation resonances using a method based on multichannel quantum defect theory and an optical potential becomes problematic, making it necessary to implement an alternative, approximate treatment of Auger decay for neutral Mg. The new cross sections are used to fit the Mg K edge in XMM-Newton spectra of the low-mass X-ray binary GS 1826-238, where most of the interstellar Mg is found to be in ionized form.",13,[],5

Self-seeding by a forward Bragg diffraction (FBD) monochromator has been recently proposed [1] and demonstrated [2]. Characteristic time To of FBD determines the power, spectral, and time characteristics of the FBD seed [3]. Here we show that for a given electron bunch with duration sigmae the spectral flux of the self-seeding XFEL can be maximized, and the spectral bandwidth can be respectively minimized by choosing To ~ sigmae/pi and by optimizing the electron bunch delay taue. The choices of To and taue are not unique. In all cases, the maximum value of the spectral flux and the minimum bandwidth are primarily determined by sigmae. Two-color seeding takes place To >> sigmae/letter.

Conditions for super-resolution foci were analysised in details. Particularly strong super-resolution foci with spot size falling at least 50% below the diffraction limit were identified and possible new applications were suggested. To understand how the super-resolution conditions could be scaled to other refractive-index particles or background medium, principles of field-invariant parameters scaling (size, wavelength, and refractive index) were revealed and demonstrated with example cases.

1311.1603,physics,"The analysis of negative birefringence optically induced in major air components (Loriot et al., [1, 2]) is revisited in light of the recently reported plasma grating-induced phase-shift effect predicted for strong field pump-probe experiments (Wahlstrand and Milchberg, [3]). The nonlinear birefrin- gence induced by a short and intense laser pulse in argon is measured by femtosecond time-resolved polarimetry. The experiments are performed with degenerate colors, where the pump and probe beam share the same spectrum, or with two different colors and non-overlapping spectra. The in- terpretation of the experimental results is substantiated using a numerical 3D1 model accounting for nonlinear propagation effects, cross-beam geometry of the interacting laser pulses, and detec- tion technique. The model also includes the ionization rate of argon and high-order Kerr indices introduced by Loriot et al. enabling to assess the contribution of both terms to the observed effect. The results show that the ionization-induced phase-shift has a minor contribution compared to the high-order Kerr effect formerly introduced, the latter allowing a reasonably good reproduction of the experimental data for the present conditions.",13,[],5
1309.3509,physics,"We complete the literature on the statistical mechanics of point vortices in two-dimensional hydrodynamics. Using a maximum entropy principle, we determine the multi-species Boltzmann-Poisson equation and establish a form of virial theorem. Using a maximum entropy production principle (MEPP), we derive a set of relaxation equations towards statistical equilibrium. These relaxation equations can be used as a numerical algorithm to compute the maximum entropy state. We mention the analogies with the Fokker-Planck equations derived by Debye and Huckel for electrolytes. We then consider the limit of strong mixing (or low energy). To leading order, the relationship between the vorticity and the stream function at equilibrium is linear and the maximization of the entropy becomes equivalent to the minimization of the enstrophy. This expansion is similar to the Debye-Huckel approximation for electrolytes, except that the temperature is negative instead of positive so that the effective interaction between like-sign vortices is attractive instead of repulsive. This leads to an organization at large scales presenting geometry-induced phase transitions, instead of Debye shielding. We compare the results obtained with point vortices to those obtained in the context of the statistical mechanics of continuous vorticity fields described by the Miller-Robert-Sommeria (MRS) theory. At linear order, we get the same results but differences appear at the next order. In particular, the MRS theory predicts a transition between sinh and tanh-like letter-letter relationships depending on the sign of Ku-3 (where Ku is the Kurtosis) while there is no such transition for point vortices which always show a sinh-like letter-letter relationship. We derive the form of the relaxation equations in the strong mixing limit and show that the enstrophy plays the role of a Lyapunov functional.",13,[],5
1306.0067,physics,"We propose a method for measuring the magnetic dipole (M1) transition moment of the equation transition in single trapped Baequation by exploiting different symmetries in the electric quadrupole (E2) and M1 couplings between the states. The technique is adapted from a previously proposed method for measuring atomic parity nonconservation in a single trapped ion [Norval Fortson, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf70, 17 (1993)]. Knowledge of M1 is crucial for any parity nonconservation measurement in Baequation, as laser coupling through M1 can mimic the parity-violating signal. The magnetic moment for the transition has been calculated by atomic theory and found to be dominated by electron-electron correlation effects [B.K. Sahoo et. al., Phys. Rev. A \textbf74, 6 (2006)]. To date the value has not been verified experimentally. This proposed measurement is therefore an essential step toward a parity nonconservation experiment in the ion that will also test current many-body theory. The technique can be adapted for similar parity nonconservation experiments using other atomic ions, where the magnetic dipole moment could present similar complications.",13,[],5

We show that magnetic fields are self-excited over a range of flow parameters such as amplitude and frequency of flow oscillations, fluid Reynolds (Re) and magnetic Reynolds (Rm) numbers.

One is using a U-shaped bent waveguide to break the adiabatic mode conversion process, and the other is to render the dielectric mode of higher-order to reach phase matching with plasmon mode. Both the transmission spectrum of waveguide and the energy spectrum of cavity demonstrate that the coupling efficiencies can be greatly improved.

The last modes are energy conserving in the inviscid case. They are localized in the cross-stream direction and periodic in the streamwise direction. As for the kinematics, they travel at constant velocity in the cross-stream direction, whilst in the streamwise direction they are accelerated by the base flow. In the viscous case, the modes break down due to damping of high wavenumber contributions.",13,[],5

The numerical calculation of the many-body theory diagrams is performed using B-spline basis sets. To elucidate the r\ole of the positron-ion repulsion, the annihilation rate is also estimated analytically in the Coulomb-Born approximation. It is found that the energy dependence and magnitude of equation is governed by the Gamow factor that characterizes the suppression of the positron wave function near the ion.

Results of the calculations for equation, equation and d-wave incident positrons of energies up to the positronium formation threshold are presented. Where comparison is possible, our values are in excellent agreement with the results obtained using other, e.g., variational, methods.

The concept of the number of degrees of freedom, which relates the observable quantities listed above, is generalized to the case of low temperatures. An analogy between the creation and annihilation operators for pairs (dimers) and the creation and annihilation operators for particles (molecules) is carried out. A generalization of the concept of a Bose condensate is introduced for classical molecules as an analog of an ideal liquid (without attraction). The negative pressure in the liquid is treated as holes (of exciton type) in the density of the Bose condensate. The phase transition gas-liquid is calculated for an ideal gas (without attraction). A comparison with experimental data is carried out.   In the other part of the paper, we introduce the concept of new observable quantity, namely, of a pair (a dimer), as a result of attraction between the nearest neighbors. We treat in a new way the concepts of Boyle temperature equation (as the temperature above which the dimers disappear) and of the critical temperature equation (below which the trimers and clusters are formed). The equation for the Zeno line is interpreted as the relation describing the dependence of the temperature on the density at which the dimers disappear. We calculate the maximal density of the liquid and also the maximal density of the holes.

A reduction in size generates an LD curve that is high but relatively flat. In European data, the curve is steep, suggesting a history of population expansion.   These conclusions emerge from the study of equation, a measure of LD that has never played a central role. It has been seen merely as an approximation to another measure, equation.

Here we probe the dynamics of an experimental producer parasite ecosystem as it approaches a catastrophic collapse. Surprisingly, the producer population grows in size as the environment deteriorates, highlighting that population size can be a misleading measure of ecosystem stability. By analyzing the oscillatory producer parasite dynamics for over ~100 generations in multiple environmental conditions, we found that the collective ecosystem dynamics slows down as the tipping point is approached.

Decreases in fisheries production when nutrient loads are decreased are also well documented. However, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) persists in describing the area adjacent to the Mississippi River discharge as a ""dead zone"" and predicting dire consequences if nutrient loads are not reduced. In reality, these areas teem with aquatic life and provide 70-80% of the Gulf of Mexico fishery production. On June 18, 2013, NOAA published a misleading figure purporting to show the ""dead zone"" in an article predicting a possible record dead zone area for 2013 (http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2013/20130618deadzone.html). This area is not a region of hypoxic bottom water at all nor is it related directly to 2013 predicted hypoxia. This figure appeared as early as 2004 in a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) article (http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/environment/deadzone.html) as a satellite image where the red area represents turbidity and is much larger than the short-lived areas of hypoxic bottom water documented in actual NOAA measurements. Thus, it is misleading for NOAA to characterize the red area in that image as a ""dead zone."" The NOAA has also published other misleading and exaggerated descriptions of the consequences of nutrient loading.",13,[],10
1307.7798,q-bio,"A variety of methods have been proposed for structure similarity calculation, which are called structure alignment or superposition. One major shortcoming in current structure alignment algorithms is in their inherent design, which is based on local structure similarity. In this work, we propose a method to incorporate global information in obtaining optimal alignments and superpositions. Our method, when applied to optimizing the TM-score and the GDT score, produces significantly better results than current state-of-the-art protein structure alignment tools. Specifically, if the highest TM-score found by TMalign is lower than (0.6) and the highest TM-score found by one of the tested methods is higher than (0.5), there is a probability of (42%) that TMalign failed to find TM-scores higher than (0.5), while the same probability is reduced to (2%) if our method is used. This could significantly improve the accuracy of fold detection if the cutoff TM-score of (0.5) is used.   In addition, existing structure alignment algorithms focus on structure similarity alone and simply ignore other important similarities, such as sequence similarity. Our approach has the capacity to incorporate multiple similarities into the scoring function. Results show that sequence similarity aids in finding high quality protein structure alignments that are more consistent with eye-examined alignments in HOMSTRAD. Even when structure similarity itself fails to find alignments with any consistency with eye-examined alignments, our method remains capable of finding alignments highly similar to, or even identical to, eye-examined alignments.",13,[],10
1304.1698,q-bio,"Rapidly growing public gene expression databases contain a wealth of data for building an unprecedentedly detailed picture of human biology and disease. This data comes from many diverse measurement platforms that make integrating it all difficult. Although RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is attracting the most attention, at present the rate of new microarray studies submitted to public databases far exceeds the rate of new RNA-seq studies. There is clearly a need for methods that make it easier to combine data from different technologies. In this paper, we propose a new method for processing RNA-seq data that yields gene expression estimates that are much more similar to corresponding estimates from microarray data, hence greatly improving cross-platform comparability. The method we call PREBS is based on estimating the expression from RNA-seq reads overlapping the microarray probe regions, and processing these estimates with microarray summarisation algorithm RMA. Using paired microarray and RNA-seq samples from TCGA LAML data set we show that PREBS expression estimates derived from RNA-seq are more similar to microarray-based expression estimates than those from other RNA-seq processing methods. In an experiment to retrieve paired microarray samples from a database using an RNA-seq query sample, gene signatures defined based on PREBS expression estimates were found to be much more accurate than those from other methods. PREBS also allows new ways of using RNA-seq data, such as expression estimation for microarray probe sets. An implementation of the proposed method is available in the Bioconductor package `prebs'.",13,[],10

It is believed that in 2007 more people died of MRSA than of AIDS worldwide. In Australia ""there are about 2000 people per year who have a bloodstream infection with the MRSA germ and the vast majority of those get them from health care procedure"" (Nader, 2005).

1310.1853,q-bio,"We investigate the dynamics of cancer initiation in a mathematical model with one driver mutation and several passenger mutations. Our analysis is based on a multi type branching process: We model individual cells which can either divide or undergo apoptosis. In case of a cell division, the two daughter cells can mutate, which potentially confers a change in fitness to the cell. In contrast to previous models, the change in fitness induced by the driver mutation depends on the genetic context of the cell, in our case on the number of passenger mutations. The passenger mutations themselves have no or only a very small impact on the cell's fitness. While our model is not designed as a specific model for a particular cancer, the underlying idea is motivated by clinical and experimental observations in Burkitt Lymphoma. In this tumor, the hallmark mutation leads to deregulation of the MYC oncogene which increases the rate of apoptosis, but also the proliferation rate of cells. This increase in the rate of apoptosis hence needs to be overcome by mutations affecting apoptotic pathways, naturally leading to an epistatic fitness landscape. This model shows a very interesting dynamical behavior which is distinct from the dynamics of cancer initiation in the absence of epistasis. Since the driver mutation is deleterious to a cell with only a few passenger mutations, there is a period of stasis in the number of cells until a clone of cells with enough passenger mutations emerges. Only when the driver mutation occurs in one of those cells, the cell population starts to grow rapidly.",13,[],10
1307.0737,q-bio,"In large populations, multiple beneficial mutations may be simultaneously spreading. In asexual populations, these mutations must either arise on the same background or compete against each other. In sexual populations, recombination can bring together beneficial alleles from different backgrounds, but tightly linked alleles may still greatly interfere with each other. We show for well-mixed populations that when this interference is strong, the genome can be seen as consisting of many effectively asexual stretches linked together. The rate at which beneficial alleles fix is thus roughly proportional to the rate of recombination, and depends only logarithmically on the mutation supply and the strength of selection. Our scaling arguments also allow to predict, with reasonable accuracy, the distribution of effects of fixed mutations when new mutations have broadly-distributed effects. We focus on the regime in which crossovers occur more frequently than beneficial mutations, as is likely to be the case for many natural populations.",13,[],10

1303.4383,q-bio,"Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are highly variable envelope glycoproteins. Here hydropathic analysis, previously applied to quantify common flu (H1N1) evolution (1934-), is applied to the evolution of less common but more virulent (avian derived) H3N2 (1968-), beginning with N2. Whereas N1 exhibited opposing migration and vaccination pressures, the dominant N2 trend is due to vaccination, with only secondary migration interactions. Separation and evaluation of these effects is made possible by the use of two distinct hydropathic scales representing first-order and second-order thermodynamic interactions. The evolutions of H1 and H3 are more complex, with larger competing migration and vaccination effects. The linkages of H3 and N2 evolutionary trends are examined on two modular length scales, medium (glycosidic) and large (corresponding to sialic acid interactions). The hierarchical hydropathic results complement and greatly extend advanced phylogenetic results obtained from similarity studies. They exhibit simple quantitative trends that can be transferred to engineer oncolytic properties of other viral proteins to treat recalcitrant cancers.",13,[],10
1304.4673,q-bio,"Canids display a wide diversity of social systems, from solitary to pairs to packs, and hence they have been extensively used as model systems to understand social dynamics in natural systems. Among canids, the dog can show various levels of social organization due to the influence of humans on their lives. Though the dog is known as man's best friend and has been studied extensively as a pet, studies on the natural history, ecology and behaviour of dogs in a natural habitat are rare. Here we report results of an extensive population-level study conducted through one-time censuses in urban India to understand the ecoethology of free-ranging dogs. We built a model to test if the observed groups could have been formed through random associations while foraging. Our modeling results suggest that the dogs, like all efficient scavengers, tend to forage singly but also form random uncorrelated groups. A closer inspection of the group compositions however reveals that the foraging associations are non-random events. The tendency of adults to associate with the opposite sex in the mating season and of juveniles to stay close to adults in the non-mating season drives the population towards aggregation, in spite of the apparently random nature of the group size distribution. Hence we conclude that to be or not to be social is a matter of choice for the free-ranging dogs, and not a matter of chance.",13,[],10
1304.4856,q-bio,"The expected level of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in a finite ideal population at equilibrium is of relevance for many applications in population and quantitative genetics. Several recursion formulae have been proposed during the last decades, whose derivations mostly contain heuristic parts and therefore remain mathematically questionable. We propose a more justifiable approach, including an alternative recursion formula for the expected LD. Since the exact formula depends on the distribution of allele frequencies in a very complicated manner, we suggest an approximate solution and analyze its validity extensively in a simulation study. Compared to the widely used formula of Sved, the proposed formula performs better for all parameter constellations considered. We then analyze the expected LD at equilibrium using the theory on discrete-time Markov chains based on the linear recursion formula, with equilibrium being defined as the steady-state of the chain, which finally leads to a formula for the effective population size Ne. An additional analysis considers the effect of non-exactness of a recursion formula on the steady-state, demonstrating that the resulting error in expected LD can be substantial. In an application to the HapMap data of two human populations we illustrate the dependency of the Ne-estimate on the distribution of minor allele frequencies (MAFs), showing that the estimated Ne can vary by up to 30% when a uniform instead of a skewed distribution of MAFs is taken as a basis to select SNPs for the analyses. Our analyses provide new insights into the mathematical complexity of the problem studied.",13,[],10
1308.0879,q-bio,"Nonlinear oscillators have been used to model neurons that fire periodically in the absence of input. These oscillators, which are called neuronal oscillator, share some common response structures with other biological oscillations. In this study, we analyze the dependence of the global dynamics of an impulse-driven stochastic neuronal oscillator on the relaxation rate to the limit cycle, the strength of the intrinsic noise, and the impulsive input parameters. To do this, we use a Markov operator that both reflects the density evolution of the oscillator and is an extension of the phase transition curve, which describes the phase shift due to a single isolated impulse. Previously, we derived the Markov operator for the finite relaxation rate that describes the dynamics of the entire phase plane. Here, we construct a Markov operator for the infinite relaxation rate that describes the stochastic dynamics restricted to the limit cycle. In both cases, the response of the stochastic neuronal oscillator to time-varying impulses is described by a product of Markov operators. Furthermore, we calculate the number of spikes between two consecutive impulses to relate the dynamics of the oscillator to the number of spikes per unit time and the interspike interval density. Specifically, we analyze the dynamics of the number of spikes per unit time based on the properties of the Markov operators. Each Markov operator can be decomposed into stationary and transient components based on the properties of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. This allows us to evaluate the difference in the number of spikes per unit time between the stationary and transient responses of the oscillator, which we show to be based on the dependence of the oscillator on past activity. Our analysis shows how the duration of the past neuronal activity depends on the relaxation rate, the noise strength and the input parameters.",13,[],10
1307.8407,q-bio,"With the advent of Next-Generation (NG) sequencing, it has become possible to sequence an entire genome quickly and inexpensively. However, in some experiments one only needs to extract and assembly a portion of the sequence reads, for example when performing transcriptome studies, sequencing mitochondrial genomes, or characterizing exomes. With the raw DNA-library of a complete genome it would appear to be a trivial problem to identify reads of interest. But it is not always easy to incorporate well-known tools such as BLAST, BLAT, Bowtie, and SOAP directly into a bioinformatics pipelines before the assembly stage, either due to in- compatibility with the assembler's file inputs, or because it is desirable to incorporate information that must be extracted separately. For example, in order to incorporate flowgrams from a Roche 454 sequencer into the Newbler assembler it is necessary to first extract them from the original SFF files. We present SlopMap, a bioinformatics software utility which allows rapid identification similar to provided target sequences from either Roche 454 or Illumnia DNA library. With a simple and intuitive command- line interface along with file output formats compatible with assembly programs, SlopMap can be directly embedded in biological data processing pipeline without any additional programming work. In addition, SlopMap preserves flowgram information needed for Roche 454 assembler.",13,[],10
1305.4354,q-bio,"Kin selection theory is a kind of causal analysis. The initial form of kin selection ascribed cause to costs, benefits, and genetic relatedness. The theory then slowly developed a deeper and more sophisticated approach to partitioning the causes of social evolution. Controversy followed because causal analysis inevitably attracts opposing views. It is always possible to separate total effects into different component causes. Alternative causal schemes emphasize different aspects of a problem, reflecting the distinct goals, interests, and biases of different perspectives. For example, group selection is a particular causal scheme with certain advantages and significant limitations. Ultimately, to use kin selection theory to analyze natural patterns and to understand the history of debates over different approaches, one must follow the underlying history of causal analysis. This article describes the history of kin selection theory, with emphasis on how the causal perspective improved through the study of key patterns of natural history, such as dispersal and sex ratio, and through a unified approach to demographic and social processes. Independent historical developments in the multivariate analysis of quantitative traits merged with the causal analysis of social evolution by kin selection.",13,[],10

Here, we explored if the bias in the generation of CNV that is associated to DNA replication timing might have conditioned the birth of new protein-coding genes during evolution. We show that genes that were duplicated during primate evolution are more commonly found among the human genes located in late-replicating CNV regions. We traced the relationship between replication timing and the evolutionary age of duplicated genes. Strikingly, we found that there is a significant enrichment of evolutionary younger duplicates in late replicating regions of the human and mouse genome. Indeed, the presence of duplicates in late replicating regions gradually decreases as the evolutionary time since duplication extends. Our results suggest that the accumulation of recent duplications in late replicating CNV regions is an active process influencing genome evolution.",13,[],10

Neither (1) nor (2) is necessarily problematic in and of itself, but the two are inconsistent, as the first pertains to cultural change whereas the second to the biological evolution of humans.

1307.7084,q-bio,"The inositol-phosphate messenger inositol(1,3,4,5)tetrakisphosphate (IP4) is essential for thymocyte positive selection by regulating plasma-membrane association of the protein tyrosine kinase Itk downstream of the T cell receptor (TCR). IP4 can act as a soluble analog of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) membrane lipid product phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 recruits signaling proteins such as Itk to cellular membranes by binding to PH and other domains. In thymocytes, low-dose IP4 binding to the Itk PH domain surprisingly promoted and high-dose IP4 inhibited PIP3 binding of Itk PH domains. However, the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of membrane recruitment of Itk by IP4 and PIP3 remain unclear. The distinct Itk PH domain ability to oligomerize is consistent with a cooperative-allosteric mode of IP4 action. However, other possibilities cannot be ruled out due to difficulties in quantitatively measuring the interactions between Itk, IP4 and PIP3, and in generating non-oligomerizing Itk PH domain mutants. This has hindered a full mechanistic understanding of how IP4 controls Itk function. By combining experimentally measured kinetics of PLCletter1 phosphorylation by Itk with in silico modeling of multiple Itk signaling circuits and a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) based computational approach, we show that those in silico models which are most robust against variations of protein and lipid expression levels and kinetic rates at the single cell level share a cooperative-allosteric mode of Itk regulation by IP4 involving oligomeric Itk PH domains at the plasma membrane. This identifies MaxEnt as an excellent tool for quantifying robustness for complex TCR signaling circuits and provides testable predictions to further elucidate a controversial mechanism of PIP3 signaling.",13,[],10

1301.3981,q-bio,"Molecular phenotypes are important links between genomic information and organismic functions, fitness, and evolution. Complex phenotypes, which are also called quantitative traits, often depend on multiple genomic loci. Their evolution builds on genome evolution in a complicated way, which involves selection, genetic drift, mutations and recombination. Here we develop a coarse-grained evolutionary statistics for phenotypes, which decouples from details of the underlying genotypes. We derive approximate evolution equations for the distribution of phenotype values within and across populations. This dynamics covers evolutionary processes at high and low recombination rates, that is, it applies to sexual and asexual populations. In a fitness landscape with a single optimal phenotype value, the phenotypic diversity within populations and the divergence between populations reach evolutionary equilibria, which describe stabilizing selection. We compute the equilibrium distributions of both quantities analytically and we show that the ratio of mean divergence and diversity depends on the strength of selection in a universal way: it is largely independent of the phenotype's genomic encoding and of the recombination rate. This establishes a new method for the inference of selection on molecular phenotypes beyond the genome level.

Cancer drugs ideally kill cancer cells while limiting harm to healthy cells. However, the inherent variance among cells in both cancer and healthy cell populations increases the difficulty of selective drug action. Here we propose a classification framework based on the idea that an ideal cancer drug should maximally discriminate between cancer and healthy cells. We first explore how molecular markers can be used to discriminate cancer cells from healthy cells on a single cell basis, and then how the effects of drugs are statistically predicted by these molecular markers. We then combine these two ideas to show how to optimally match drugs to tumor cells. We find that expression levels of a handful of genes suffice to discriminate well between individual cells in cancer and healthy tissue. We also find that gene expression predicts the efficacy of cancer drugs, suggesting that the cancer drugs act as classifiers using gene profiles. In agreement with our first finding, a small number of genes predict drug efficacy well. Finally, we formulate a framework that defines an optimal drug, and predicts drug cocktails that may target cancer more accurately than the individual drugs alone.

Recent developments have resulted in greater knowledge of the fate of iron in the body and have led to a detailed map of its metabolism, however a quantitative understanding at the systems level of how its components interact to produce tight regulation remains elusive.

The model was then quantitatively validated by comparing its results with previously published physiological data, and it is able to reproduce multiple experimental findings. A time course simulation following an oral dose of iron was compared to a clinical time course study and the simulation was found to recreate the dynamics and time scale of the systems response to iron challenge. A disease simulation of haemochromatosis was created by altering a single reaction parameter that mimics a human haemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutation. The simulation provides a quantitative understanding of the liver iron overload that arises in this disease.

1303.4784,q-bio,"Wounds in the embryo show a remarkable ability to heal quickly without leaving a scar. Previous studies have found that an actomyosin ring (""purse string"") forms around the wound perimeter and contracts to close the wound over the course of several dozens of minutes. Here, we report experiments that reveal an even faster mechanism which remarkably closes wounds by more than 50% within the first 30 seconds. Circular and elliptical wounds (~100 um in size) were made in the blastoderm of early chick embryos and allowed to heal, with wound area and shape characterized as functions of time. The closure rate displayed a biphasic behavior, with rapid constriction lasting about a minute, followed by a period of more gradual closure to complete healing. Fluorescent staining suggests that both healing phases are driven by actomyosin contraction, with relatively rapid contraction of fibers at cell borders within a relatively thick ring of tissue (several cells wide) around the wound followed by slower contraction of a thin supracellular actomyosin ring along the margin, consistent with a purse string mechanism. Finite-element modeling showed that this idea is biophysically plausible, with relatively isotropic contraction within the thick ring giving way to tangential contraction in the thin ring. In addition, consistent with experimental results, simulated elliptical wounds heal with little change in aspect ratio, and decreased membrane tension can cause these wounds to open briefly before going on to heal. These results provide new insight into the healing mechanism in embryonic epithelia.",13,[],10

1311.2216,q-bio,"Fluctuating environments pose tremendous challenges to bacterial populations. It is observed in numerous bacterial species that individual cells can stochastically switch among multiple phenotypes for the population to survive in rapidly changing environments. This kind of phenotypic heterogeneity with stochastic phenotype switching is generally understood to be an adaptive bet-hedging strategy. Mathematical models are essential to gain a deeper insight into the principle behind bet-hedging and the pattern behind experimental data. Traditional deterministic models cannot provide a correct description of stochastic phenotype switching and bet-hedging, and traditional Markov chain models at the cellular level fail to explain their underlying molecular mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear stochastic model of multistable bacterial systems at the molecular level. It turns out that our model not only provides a clear description of stochastic phenotype switching and bet-hedging within isogenic bacterial populations, but also provides a deeper insight into the analysis of multidimensional experimental data. Moreover, we use some deep mathematical theories to show that our stochastic model and traditional Markov chain models are essentially consistent and reflect the dynamic behavior of the bacterial system at two different time scales.

1310.2968,q-bio,"Time-calibrated species phylogenies are critical for addressing a wide range of questions in evolutionary biology, such as those that elucidate historical biogeography or uncover patterns of coevolution and diversification. Because molecular sequence data are not informative on absolute time, external data, most commonly fossil age estimates, are required to calibrate estimates of species divergence dates. For Bayesian divergence-time methods, the common practice for calibration using fossil information involves placing arbitrarily chosen parametric distributions on internal nodes, often disregarding most of the information in the fossil record. We introduce the 'fossilized birth-death' (FBD) process, a model for calibrating divergence-time estimates in a Bayesian framework, explicitly acknowledging that extant species and fossils are part of the same macroevolutionary process. Under this model, absolute node age estimates are calibrated by a single diversification model and arbitrary calibration densities are not necessary. Moreover, the FBD model allows for inclusion of all available fossils. We performed analyses of simulated data and show that node-age estimation under the FBD model results in robust and accurate estimates of species divergence times with realistic measures of statistical uncertainty, overcoming major limitations of standard divergence time estimation methods. We then used this model to estimate the speciation times for a dataset composed of all living bears, indicating that the genus Ursus diversified in the late Miocene to mid Pliocene.",13,[],10
1309.0801,q-bio,"Identifying reliable domain-domain interactions (DDIs) will increase our ability to predict novel protein-protein interactions (PPIs), to unravel interactions in protein complexes, and thus gain more information about the function and behavior of genes. One of the challenges of identifying reliable DDIs is domain promiscuity. Promiscuous domains are domains that can occur in many domain architectures and are therefore found in many proteins. This becomes a problem for a method where the score of a domain-pair is the ratio between observed and expected frequencies because the PPI network is sparse. As such, many protein-pairs will be non-interacting and domain-pairs with promiscuous domains will be penalized. This domain promiscuity challenge to the problem of inferring reliable DDIs from PPIs has been recognized, and a number of work-arounds have been proposed. In this paper, we report an application of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to this problem. We find that the relationship between formal concepts provide a natural way for rare domains to elevate the rank of promiscuous domains, and enrich highly ranked domain-pairs with reliable DDIs. This piggy-backing of promiscuous domains onto rare domains is possible due to the domain architecture of proteins which mixes promiscuous with rare domains.",13,[],10
1312.4152,q-bio,"In mutualisms where there is exchange of resources for resources, or resources for services, the resources are typically short lived compared with the lives of the organisms that produce and make use of them.

These responses can account for intra-specific competition, due to the partition of the resources provided by mutualists, in this way connecting competition theory and mutualism at a microscopic level. It is also possible to derive saturating responses in the case of species that provide resources but expect a service in return (e.g. pollination, seed dispersal) instead of food or nutrients. In both situations, competition and saturation have the same underlying cause, which is that the generation of resources occur at a finite velocity per individual of the providing species, but their depletion happens much faster due to the acceleration in growth rates that characterizes mutualism. The resulting models can display all the basic features seen in many models of facultative and obligate mutualisms, and they can be generalized from species pairs to larger communities. The parameters of the numerical responses can be related with quantities that can be in principle measured, and that can be related by trade-offs, which can be useful for studying the evolution of mutualisms.

1309.0226,q-bio,"The development of long bones requires a sophisticated spatial organization of cellular signaling, proliferation, and differentiation programs. How such spatial organization emerges on the growing long bone domain is still unresolved. Based on the reported biochemical interactions we developed a regulatory model for the core signaling factors IHH, PTCH1, and PTHrP and included two cell types, proliferating/resting chondrocytes and (pre-)hypertrophic chondrocytes. We show that the reported IHH-PTCH1 interaction gives rise to a Schnakenberg-type Turing kinetics, and that inclusion of PTHrP is important to achieve robust patterning when coupling patterning and tissue dynamics. The model reproduces relevant spatiotemporal gene expression patterns, as well as a number of relevant mutant phenotypes. In summary, we propose that a ligand-receptor based Turing mechanism may control the emergence of patterns during long bone development, with PTHrP as an important mediator to confer patterning robustness when the sensitive Turing system is coupled to the dynamics of a growing and differentiating tissue. We have previously shown that ligand-receptor based Turing mechanisms can also result from BMP-receptor and GDNF-receptor interactions, and that these reproduce the wildtype and mutant patterns during digit formation in limbs and branching morphogenesis in lung and kidneys. Receptor-ligand interactions may thus constitute a general mechanism to generate Turing patterns in nature.",13,[],10
1302.0476,q-bio,"Phase oscillators are a common starting point for the reduced description of many single neuron models that exhibit a strongly attracting limit cycle. The framework for analysing such models in response to weak perturbations is now particularly well advanced, and has allowed for the development of a theory of weakly connected neural networks. However, the strong-attraction assumption may well not be the natural one for many neural oscillator models. For example, the popular conductance based Morris-Lecar model is known to respond to periodic pulsatile stimulation in a chaotic fashion that cannot be adequately described with a phase reduction. In this paper, we generalise the phase description that allows one to track the evolution of distance from the cycle as well as phase on cycle. We use a classical technique from the theory of ordinary differential equations that makes use of a moving coordinate system to analyse periodic orbits. The subsequent phase-amplitude description is shown to be very well suited to understanding the response of the oscillator to external stimuli (which are not necessarily weak). We consider a number of examples of neural oscillator models, ranging from planar through to high dimensional models, to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach in providing an improvement over the standard phase-reduction technique. As an explicit application of this phase-amplitude framework, we consider in some detail the response of a generic planar model where the strong-attraction assumption does not hold, and examine the response of the system to periodic pulsatile forcing. In addition, we explore how the presence of dynamical shear can lead to a chaotic response.",13,[],10
1307.0869,q-bio,"With the astonishing rate that the genomic and metagenomic sequence data sets are accumulating, there are many reasons to constrain the data analyses. One approach to such constrained analyses is to focus on select subsets of gene families that are particularly well suited for the tasks at hand. Such gene families have generally been referred to as marker genes. We are particularly interested in identifying and using such marker genes for phylogenetic and phylogeny-driven ecological studies of microbes and their communities. We therefore refer to these as PhyEco (for phylogenetic and phylogenetic ecology) markers. The dual use of these PhyEco markers means that we needed to develop and apply a set of somewhat novel criteria for identification of the best candidates for such markers. The criteria we focused on included universality across the taxa of interest, ability to be used to produce robust phylogenetic trees that reflect as much as possible the evolution of the species from which the genes come, and low variation in copy number across taxa. We describe here an automated protocol for identifying potential PhyEco markers from a set of complete genome sequences. The protocol combines rapid searching, clustering and phylogenetic tree building algorithms to generate protein families that meet the criteria listed above. We report here the identification of PhyEco markers for different taxonomic levels including 40 for all bacteria and archaea, 114 for all bacteria, and much more for some of the individual phyla of bacteria. This new list of PhyEco markers should allow much more detailed automated phylogenetic and phylogenetic ecology analyses of these groups than possible previously.",13,[],10
1301.3077,q-bio,"The evolutionary pressures that underlie the large-scale functional organization of the genome are not well understood in eukaryotes. Recent evidence suggests that functionally similar genes may colocalize (cluster) in the eukaryotic genome, suggesting the role of chromatin-level gene regulation in shaping the physical distribution of coordinated genes. However, few of the bioinformatic tools currently available allow for a systematic study of gene colocalization across several, evolutionarily distant species. Kerfuffle is a web tool designed to help discover, visualize, and quantify the physical organization of genomes by identifying significant gene colocalization and conservation across the assembled genomes of available species (currently up to 47, from humans to worms). Kerfuffle only requires the user to specify a list of human genes and the names of other species of interest. Without further input from the user, the software queries the e!Ensembl BioMart server to obtain positional information and discovers homology relations in all genes and species specified. Using this information, Kerfuffle performs a multi-species clustering analysis, presents downloadable lists of clustered genes, performs Monte Carlo statistical significance calculations, estimates how conserved gene clusters are across species, plots histograms and interactive graphs, allows users to save their queries, and generates a downloadable visualization of the clusters using the Circos software.

1312.5204,q-bio,"Yeast cells produce daughter cells through a DNA replication and mitosis cycle associated with checkpoints and governed by the cell cycle regulatory network. To ensure genome stability and genetic information inheritance, this regulatory network must be dynamically robust against various fluctuations. Here we construct a simplified cell cycle model for a budding yeast to investigate the underlying mechanism that ensures robustness in this process containing sequential tasks (DNA replication and mitosis). We first establish a three-variable model and select a parameter set that qualitatively describes the yeast cell cycle process. Then, through nonlinear dynamic analysis, we demonstrate that the yeast cell cycle process is an excitable system driven by a sequence of saddle-node bifurcations with ghost effects. We further show that the yeast cell cycle trajectory is globally attractive with modularity in both state and parameter space, while the convergent manifold provides a suitable control state for cell cycle checkpoints. These results not only highlight a regulatory mechanism for executing successive cell cycle processes, but also provide a possible strategy for the synthetic network design of sequential-task processes.",13,[],10

Its etiology remains enigmatic despite intense research efforts over many decades. By use of empirically well-constrained computer models describing the coupled function of the baroreceptor reflex and mechanics of the circulatory system, we demonstrate quantitatively that arterial stiffening seems sufficient to explain age-related emergence of hypertension. Specifically, the empirically observed chronic changes in pulse pressure with age, and the impaired capacity of hypertensive individuals to regulate short-term changes in blood pressure, arise as emergent properties of the integrated system. Results are consistent with available experimental data from chemical and surgical manipulation of the cardio-vascular system. In contrast to widely held opinions, the results suggest that primary hypertension can be attributed to a mechanogenic etiology without challenging current conceptions of renal and sympathetic nervous system function. The results support the view that a major target for treating chronic hypertension in the elderly is the reestablishment of a proper baroreflex response.",13,[],10
1310.0889,q-bio,"An intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) lacks a stable three-dimensional structure, while it folds into a specific structure when it binds to a target molecule. In some IDP-target complexes, not all target binding surfaces are exposed on the outside, and intermediate states are observed in their binding processes. We consider that stepwise target recognition via intermediate states is a characteristic of IDP binding to targets with ""hidden"" binding sites. To investigate IDP binding to hidden target binding sites, we constructed an IDP lattice model based on the HP model. In our model, the IDP is modeled as a chain and the target is modeled as a highly coarse-grained object. We introduced motion and internal interactions to the target to hide its binding sites. In the case of unhidden binding sites, a two-state transition between the free states and a bound state is observed, and we consider that this represents coupled folding and binding. Introducing hidden binding sites, we found an intermediate bound state in which the IDP forms various structures to temporarily stabilize the complex. The intermediate state provides a scaffold for the IDP to access the hidden binding site. We call this process multiform binding. We conclude that structural flexibility of IDPs enables them to access hidden binding sites, and this is a functional advantage of IDPs.",13,[],10
1306.0025,q-bio,"Here we use Drosophila melanogaster to create a genetic model of human permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus and present experimental results describing dimensions of this complexity. The approach involves the transgenic expression of a misfolded mutant of human preproinsulin, hINSC96Y, which is a cause of the disease. When expressed in fly imaginal discs, hINSC96Y causes a reduction of adult structures, including the eye, wing and notum. Eye imaginal discs exhibit defects in both the structure and arrangement of ommatidia. In the wing, expression of hINSC96Y leads to ectopic expression of veins and mechano-sensory organs, indicating disruption of wild type signaling processes regulating cell fates. These readily measurable disease phenotypes are sensitive to temperature, gene dose and sex. Mutant (but not wild type) proinsulin expression in the eye imaginal disc induces IRE1-mediated Xbp1 alternative splicing, a signal for endoplasmic reticulum stress response activation, and produces global change in gene expression. Mutant hINS transgene tester strains, when crossed to stocks from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel produces F1 adults with a continuous range of disease phenotypes and large broad-sense heritability. Surprisingly, the severity of mutant hINS-induced disease in the eye is not correlated with that in the notum in these crosses, nor with eye reduction phenotypes caused by the expression of two dominant eye mutants acting in two different eye development pathways, Drop (Dr) or Lobe (L) when crossed into the same genetic backgrounds. The tissue specificity of genetic variability for mutant hINS-induced disease thus has its own distinct signature.

It has been proposed that the microtubule movement is due to stochastic variations in the densities of the two species of motor proteins. We test this hypothesis here by showing how it maps onto a one-dimensional random walk in a random environment. Our estimate of the amplitude of the fluctuations agrees with experimental observations. We point out that there is an initial transient in the position of the microtubule where it will typically move of order its own length. We compare the physics of this gliding assay to a recent theory of the role of antagonistic motors on restricting interpolar microtubule sliding of a cell's mitotic spindle during prometaphase. It is concluded that randomly positioned antagonistic motors can restrict relative movement of microtubules, however they do so imperfectly. A variation in motor concentrations is also analyzed and shown to lead to greater control of spindle length.",13,[],10

Using a robot to move participant's passive limbs, we performed psychophysical estimates of proprioceptive function for each limb independently, and again when subjects grasped the robot handle with both arms. We compared empirical estimates of bimanual proprioception to several models from the sensory integration literature: some that propose a combination of signals from the left and right arms (such as a Bayesian maximum-likelihood estimate), and some that propose using unimanual signals alone. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the nervous system both has knowledge of, and uses the limb with the best proprioceptive acuity for bimanual proprioception. Surprisingly, a Bayesian model that postulates optimal combination of sensory signals could not predict empirically observed bimanual acuity. These findings suggest that while the central nervous system seems to have information about the relative sensory acuity of each limb, it uses this information in a rather rudimentary fashion, essentially ignoring information from the less reliable limb.",13,[],10
1302.6952,q-bio,"At functional scales, cortical behavior results from the complex interplay of a large number of excitable cells operating in noisy environments.

Based on recent mean-field reductions for such spiking neurons, we present here a principled reduction of large biologically plausible neuronal networks to firing-rate models, providing a rigorous relationship between the macroscopic activity of populations of spiking neurons and popular macroscopic models, under a few assumptions (mainly linearity of the synapses). The reduced model we derive consists of simple, low-dimensional ordinary differential equations with parameters and nonlinearities derived from the underlying properties of the cells, and in particular the noise level.

We present a method that allows a more robust estimation of these escape rates from serially sampled sequence data. The proposed method accounts for competition between multiple escapes by explicitly modeling the accumulation of escape mutations and the stochastic effects of rare multiple mutants. Applying our method to serially sampled HIV sequence data, we estimate rates of HIV escape that are substantially larger than those previously reported.

A key ingredient is to specify the first two moments of the frequency spectrum. We show that these moments can be determined analytically if a population has experienced two instantaneous size changes in the past. We apply our method to data from ten human populations gathered in the 1000 genomes project, estimate their demographies and define demography-adjusted versions of Tajima's equation, Fay & Wu's equation, and Zeng's equation. The adjusted test statistics facilitate the direct comparison between populations and they show that most of the differences among populations seen in the original tests can be explained by demography.

The simplicity of the model allows analytical treatment to determine the subcritical and supercritical regimes in the space of parameters. By incorporating a density-dependent mechanism the model is able to capture additional relevant features observed in experimental data, such as the characteristic parasitemia waves. In summary our approach provides a new general framework to address the dynamics of antigenic variation which can be easily adapted to cope with broader and more complex situations.",13,[],10
1303.0805,q-bio,"Intrapatient HIV-1 evolution is dominated by selection on the protein level in the arms race with the adaptive immune system. When cytotoxic CD8 T-cells or neutralizing antibodies target a new epitope, the virus often escapes via nonsynonymous mutations that impair recognition. Synonymous mutations do not affect this interplay and are often assumed to be neutral. We analyze longitudinal intrapatient data from the C2-V5 part of the envelope gene (env) and observe that synonymous derived alleles rarely fix even though they often reach high frequencies in the viral population. We find that synonymous mutations that disrupt base pairs in RNA stems flanking the variable loops of gp120 are more likely to be lost than other synonymous changes, hinting at a direct fitness effect of these stem-loop structures in the HIV-1 RNA. Computational modeling indicates that these synonymous mutations have a (Malthusian) selection coefficient of the order of -0.002 and that they are brought up to high frequency by hitchhiking on neighboring beneficial nonsynonymous alleles. The patterns of fixation of nonsynonymous mutations estimated from the longitudinal data and comparisons with computer models suggest that escape mutations in C2-V5 are only transiently beneficial, either because the immune system is catching up or because of competition between equivalent escapes.",13,[],10

1311.2924,q-bio,"Current theories about mechanisms promoting species co-existence in diverse communities assume that species only interact ecologically. Species are treated as discrete evolutionary entities, even though abundant empirical evidence indicates that patterns of gene flow such as selfing and hybridization frequently occur in plant and animal groups. Here, we allow mating behavior to respond to local species composition and abundance in a data-driven meta-community model of species co-existence. While individuals primarily out-cross, they also maintain some small capacity for selfing and hybridization. Mating choice is treated as a 'fuzzy' behavior, determined by an interaction between intrinsic properties affecting mate choice and extrinsic properties of the local community, primarily the density and availability of sympatric inter-fertile species. When mate choice is strongly limited, even low survivorship of selfed offspring (<10%) can prevent extinction of rare species. With increasing mate choice, low hybridization success rates (~20%) maintain community level diversity for substantially longer periods of time. Given the low species densities and high diversity of tropical tree communities, the evolutionary costs of competition among sympatric congeneric species are negligible because direct competition is infrequent. In diverse communities, many species are chronically rare and thus vulnerable to stochastic extinction, which occurs rapidly if species are completely reproductively isolated. By incorporating fuzzy mating behavior into models of species co-existence, a more realistic understanding of the extinction process can be developed. Fuzzy mating strategies, potentially an important mechanism for rare species to escape extinction and gain local adaptations, should be incorporated into forest management strategies.",13,[],10

Indeed, in populations of evolving digital organisms, as prey evolved more effective predator-avoidance strategies, they explored a wider range of behavioral strategies in addition to exhibiting increased levels of behavioral complexity. Furthermore, coevolved prey became more adept in foraging, evidently through coopting components of explored sense-and-flee avoidance strategies into sense-and-retrieve foraging strategies.

1309.7157,q-bio,"Chromatin is a highly compact and dynamic nuclear structure that consists of DNA and associated proteins. The main organizational unit is the nucleosome, which consists of a histone octamer with DNA wrapped around it. Histone proteins are implicated in the regulation of eukaryote genes and they carry numerous reversible post-translational modifications that control DNA-protein interactions and the recruitment of chromatin binding proteins. Heterochromatin, the transcriptionally inactive part of the genome, is densely packed and contains histone H3 that is methylated at Lys 9 (H3K9me). The propagation of H3K9me in nucleosomes along the DNA in chromatin is antagonizing by methylation of H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4me) and acetylations of several lysines, which is related to euchromatin and active genes. We show that the related histone modifications form antagonized domains on a coarse scale. These histone marks are assumed to be initiated within distinct nucleation sites in the DNA and to propagate bi-directionally. We propose a simple computer model that simulates the distribution of heterochromatin in human chromosomes. The simulations are in agreement with previously reported experimental observations from two different human cell lines. We reproduced different types of barriers between heterochromatin and euchromatin providing a unified model for their function. The effect of changes in the nucleation site distribution and of propagation rates were studied.

In agreement with previous work, we show that fluctuating selection can generate evidence of adaptive evolution even when the expected strength of selection on a mutation is zero. However, we also find that the mutations, which contribute to both polymorphism and divergence tend, on average, to be positively selected during their lifetime, under fluctuating selection models. This is because mutations that fluctuate, by chance, to positive selected values, tend to reach higher frequencies in the population than those that fluctuate towards negative values. Hence the evidence of positive adaptive evolution detected under a fluctuating selection model by MK type approaches is genuine since fixed mutations tend to be advantageous on average during their lifetime. Never-the-less we show that methods tend to underestimate the rate of adaptive evolution when selection fluctuates.",13,[],10

1310.4219,q-bio,"Studies investigating the neural bases of cognitive phenomena such as perception, attention and decision-making increasingly employ multialternative task designs. It is essential in such designs to distinguish the neural correlates of behavioral choices arising from changes in perceptual factors, such as enhanced sensitivity to sensory information, from those arising from changes in decisional factors, such as a stronger bias for a particular response or choice (choice bias). To date such a distinction is not possible with established approaches. Thus, there is a critical need for a theoretical approach that distinguishes the effects of changes in sensitivity from those of changes in choice bias in multialternative tasks. Here, we introduce a mathematical model that decouples choice bias from perceptual sensitivity effects in multialternative detection tasks: multialternative tasks that incorporate catch trials to measure the ability to detect one among multiple (potential) stimuli or stimulus features. By formulating the perceptual decision in a novel, multidimensional signal detection framework, our model identifies the distinct effects of bias and sensitivity on behavioral choices. With a combination of analytical and numerical approaches, we demonstrate that model parameters (sensitivity, bias) are estimated reliably and uniquely, even in tasks involving arbitrarily large numbers of alternatives. Model simulations revealed that ignoring choice bias or performance during catch trials produced systematically inaccurate estimates of perceptual sensitivity, a finding that has important implications for interpreting behavioral data in multialternative detection and cued attention tasks. The model will find important application in identifying the effects of neural perturbations (stimulation or inactivation) on an animal's perception in multialternative attention and decision-making tasks.",13,[],10

Using a suite of synthetic constructs repressed by the Lac repressor and two well-known sequences that show large flexibility differences in vitro, we make precise statistical mechanical predictions as to how DNA sequence influences loop formation and test these predictions using in vivo transcription and in vitro single-molecule assays. Surprisingly, sequence-dependent flexibility does not affect in vivo gene regulation.

Correcting for this effect (a process referred to as kymograph alignment) is a common preprocessing step in nanochannel-based optical mapping workflows, and we present here a highly efficient algorithm to accomplish this via pattern recognition. We compare our method with the one previous approach, and we find that our method is orders of magnitude faster while producing data of similar quality.

1308.0699,q-bio,"The spatial structure of the cell is highly organized at all levels: from small complexes and assemblies, to local nano- and micro-clusters, to global, micrometer scales across and between cells. We suggest that this multiscale spatial cell organization also organizes signaling and coordinates cellular behavior. We propose a new view of the spatial structure of cell signaling systems. This new view describes cell signaling in terms of dynamic allosteric interactions within and among distinct, spatially organized transient clusters. The clusters vary over time and space and are on length scales from nanometers to micrometers. When considered across these length-scales, primary factors in the spatial organization are cell membrane domains and the actin cytoskeleton, both also highly dynamic. A key challenge is to understand the interplay across these multiple scales, link it to the physicochemical basis of the conformational behavior of single molecules, and ultimately relate it to cellular function. Overall, our premise is that at these scales, cell signaling should be thought of not primarily as a sequence of diffusion-controlled molecular collisions, but instead transient, allostery-driven cluster re-forming interactions.",13,[],10
1303.6374,q-bio,"We analyze and reinterpret experimental evidence from the literature to argue for an ability of tumor cells to self-regulate their aneuploidy rate. We conjecture that this ability is mediated by a diversification factor that exploits molecular mechanisms common to embryo stem cells and, to a lesser extent, adult stem cells, that is eventually reactivated in tumor cells. Moreover, we propose a direct use of the quasispecies model to cancer cells based on their significant genomic instability (i.e. aneuploidy rate), by defining master sequences lengths as the sum of all copy numbers of physically distinct whole and fragmented chromosomes. We compute an approximate error threshold such that any aneuploidy rate larger than the threshold would lead to a loss of fitness of a tumor population, and we confirm that highly aneuploid cancer populations already function with aneuploidy rates close to the estimated threshold.",13,[],10
1301.5527,q-bio,"We examine the two-dimensional extension of the model of Kessler and Sander of competition between two species identical except for dispersion rates. In this class of models, the spatial inhomogeneity of reproduction rates gives rise to an implicit cost of dispersal, due to the tendency to leave favorable locations. Then, as in the Hamilton-May model with its explicit dispersal cost, the tradeoff between dispersal case and the beneficial role of dispersal in limiting fluctuations, leads to an advantage of one dispersal rate over another, and the eventual extinction of the disadvantaged species. In two dimensions we find that while the competition leads to the elimination of one species at high and low population density, at intermediate densities the two species can coexist essentially indefinitely. This is a new phenomenon not present in either the one-dimensional form of the Kessler-Sander model nor in the totally connected Hamilton-May model, and points to the importance of geometry in the question of dispersal.",13,[],10

Here we improve this analysis by using a simple probabilistic model and the framework provided by scan statistics to define the number and location of translocation breakpoint hotspots. A key feature of our method is that it provides a global chromosome-wide significance level to clustering, as opposed to previous methods based on local criteria.

Yet the rules determining the PIC binding specificity remain poorly understood. In this study we show that nonconsensus protein-DNA binding significantly influences PIC binding preferences. We estimate that such nonconsensus binding contribute statistically at least 2-3 kcal/mol (on average) of additional attractive free energy per protein, per core promoter region. The predicted attractive effect is particularly strong at repeated poly(dA:dT) and poly(dC:dG) tracts. Overall, the computed free energy landscape of nonconsensus protein-DNA binding shows strong correlation with the measured genome-wide PIC occupancy. Remarkably, statistical PIC binding preferences to both TFIID-dominated and SAGA-dominated genes correlate with the nonconsensus free energy landscape, yet these two groups of genes are distinguishable based on the average free energy profiles. We suggest that the predicted nonconsensus binding mechanism provides a genome-wide background for specific promoter elements, such as transcription factor binding sites, TATA-like elements, and specific binding of the PIC components to nucleosomes. We also show that nonconsensus binding influences transcriptional frequency genome-wide.",13,[],10
1304.7496,q-bio,"The ecophysiological response of plants to environmental heavy metal stress is indicated by the profile of its tissue HM concentrations (Cp) versus the concentration of the HM in the substrate (Cs). We report a systems biology approach to the modelling of the Cp- Cs profile using as loose analogy, the Verhulst model of population dynamics but formulated in the concentration domain. The HM is conceptualized as an ecological organism that `colonizes' the resource zone of the plant cells driven by the potential supplied by the higher HM concentration in the substrate. The infinite occupation by the HM is limited by the eventual saturation of the cellular binding sites. The solution of the differential equation results in the logistic equation, the r-K model. The model is tested for 3 metalophillic plants T.erecta, S. vulgaris and E. splendens growing in different types of substrates, contaminated to varying extents by different copper compounds. The model fitted the experimental Cp- Cs profiles well. The r, K parameter values and secondary quantities derived from them, allowed a quantification of the number of Cu binding sites per cell at saturation, the sensitivities (affinities) of these sites for Cu in the 3 experimental systems as well as the extraction of information related to the substrate phyto-availability of the Cu. Thus even though the model operates at the systems level it permits useful insights into underlying processes that ultimately derive from the cumulative molecular processes of HM homeostasis. The chief advantages of the model are its simplicity, fewer arbitrary parameters, and the non-specification of constraints on substrate and plant type.",13,[],10
1301.3103,q-bio,"To understand sensory processing in neuronal populations, it is necessary to deliver stimuli to the sensory organs of animals and record evoked population activity downstream. However, the pathways from sensory input to synaptic currents in cells that are several synapses removed from sensory organs are complex. Intrinsic noise and uncontrolled modulatory input from other brain regions can interfere with the delivery of well-defined stimuli. Here we investigate the ability of channelrhodopsins to deliver precise time-varying currents to neurons at any point along the sensory-motor pathway. To do this, we first deduce the amplitude response function of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) using a three state Markov model of channel kinetics. With biophysically realistic parameters, this function supports a relatively broad signal passband and contains a resonance. We confirm the validity of our predicted amplitude response function using time-varying optical stimulation of excitatory neurons that express either wild type ChR2 or the ChR2(H134R) mutant. Together, our results indicate that ChR2-derived optogenetic tools are useful for delivering repeatable, time-varying currents to genetically-specified populations over a physiologically-relevant frequency band.",13,[],10

The food competition method was applied to a rat model to provoke malnutrition during lactation. The weight increase is delayed even if there is plenty milk available. To localize those regions of activity resulting from the trigeminal nerve stimulation, the vibrissae-barrel axis was employed due to the functional and morphological correlation between the vibrissae and the barrels. BOLD response changes caused by the trigeminal nerve stimulation on brain activity of malnourished and control rats were obtained at 7T.

1310.6077,q-bio,"The existence of complex (multiple-step) genetic adaptations that are ""irreducible"" (i.e., all partial combinations are less fit than the original genotype) is one of the longest standing problems in evolutionary biology. In standard genetics parlance, these adaptations require the crossing of a wide adaptive valley of deleterious intermediate stages. Here we demonstrate, using a simple model, that evolution can cross wide valleys to produce ""irreducibly complex"" adaptations by making use of previously cryptic mutations. When revealed by an evolutionary capacitor, previously cryptic mutants have higher initial frequencies than do new mutations, bringing them closer to a valley-crossing saddle in allele frequency space. Moreover, simple combinatorics imply an enormous number of candidate combinations exist within available cryptic genetic variation. We model the dynamics of crossing of a wide adaptive valley after a capacitance event using both numerical simulations and analytical approximations. Although individual valley crossing events become less likely as valleys widen, by taking the combinatorics of genotype space into account, we see that revealing cryptic variation can cause the frequent evolution of complex adaptations. This finding also effectively dismantles ""irreducible complexity"" as an argument against evolution by providing a general mechanism for crossing wide adaptive valleys.",13,[],10

The main two-level system interacts with the measurement apparatus in a Markovian way described by the Lindblad equation, and with an environment, which does not include the measuring apparatus. To analyse the environmental effects on the final density operator, we use the Redfield approach, allowing us to consider a non-Markovian noise. In the present hybrid theory, to trace out the environmental degrees of freedom, we use a previously-developed analytic method based on superoperator algebra and Nakajima-Zwanzig superoperators. Here, we analyse two types of system-environment interaction, phase and amplitude damping, which allows us to conclude that, in general, a finite-time quantum measurement performed during a certain period is more efficient than an instantaneous measurement performed at the end of it, because the rate of change of the populations is attenuated by the system-measurement apparatus interaction.",13,[],6

This simplified approach relies on the so-coined ""Revival Of Silenced Echo"" (ROSE) scheme. Low noise conditions are obtained by returning the atoms to the ground state before the echo emission.

In practice, however, entangled states are often more prone to decoherence, which may prevent reaching this performance.

1307.1001,quant-ph,"Although quantum correlations in a quantum system are characterized by the evolving quantities (which are entanglement and discord usually), we reveal such basis (i.e. the set of virtual particles) for the representation of the density matrix that the entanglement and/or discord between any two virtual particles in such representation are stationary. In particular, dealing with the nearest neighbor approximation, this system of virtual particles is represented by the equation-fermions of the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Such systems are important in quantum information devices because the evolution of quantum entanglement/discord leads to the problems of realization of quantum operations. The advantage of stationary entanglement/discord is that they are completely defined by the initial density matrix and by the Hamiltonian governing the quantum dynamics in the system under consideration. Moreover, using the special initial condition together with the special system's geometry, we construct large cluster of virtual particles with the same pairwise entanglement/discord. In other words, the measure of quantum correlations is stationary in this system and correlations are uniformly ""distributed"" among all virtual particles. As examples, we use both homogeneous and non-homogeneous spin-1/2 open chains with XY-interaction although other types of interactions might be also of interest.",13,[],6
1310.8302,quant-ph,"According to a recent no-go theorem (M. Pusey, J. Barrett and T.

This is significant because if the distributions do not overlap, then the quantum state itself is encoded by the physical variables. In such a model, it cannot coherently be maintained that the quantum state merely encodes information about underlying physical variables. The theorem, however, considers only models in which the physical variables corresponding to independently prepared systems are independent. This work considers models that are defined for a single quantum system of dimension equation, such that the independence condition does not arise. We prove a result in a similar spirit to the original no-go theorem, in the form of an upper bound on the extent to which the probability distributions can overlap, consistently with reproducing quantum predictions. In particular, models in which the quantum overlap between pure states is equal to the classical overlap between the corresponding probability distributions cannot reproduce the quantum predictions in any dimension equation.

Considered in its 'virtual space', the optical properties of such a material are homogeneous and consequently free from the cutoff-dependency associated with inhomogeneous media. This conclusion should be reconciled with recent advances in our understanding of Casimir-Lifshitz forces. We consider an example of such a system here and demonstrate that, whilst the size of the Casimir force is modified by the inhomogeneous medium, the force is cutoff-independent and can be stated exactly.

The proof relies on perturbative gadgets widely used in Hamiltonian complexity and we provide an introduction to these techniques using the Schrieffer-Wolff method. Since the difficulty of this problem has been well appreciated before this formalization, practitioners have turned to a host approximate Hamiltonians. By extending the results of \citeSchuch09, we show in DFT, although the introduction of an approximate potential leads to a non-interacting Hamiltonian, it remains, in the worst case, an NP-complete problem.",13,[],6
1312.1833,quant-ph,"Coherent transport promises to be the basis for an emerging new technology. Notwithstanding, a mechanistic understanding of the fundamental principles behind optimal scattering media is still missing. Here, complex network analysis is applied for the characterization of geometries that result in optimal coherent transport. The approach is tailored towards the elucidation of the subtle relationship between transport and geometry. Investigating systems with a different number of elementary units allows us to identify classes of structures which are common to all system sizes and which possess distinct robustness features. In particular, we find that small groups of two or three sites closely packed together that do not carry excitation at any time are fundamental to realize efficient and robust excitation transport. Features identified in small systems recur also in larger systems, what suggests that such strategy can efficiently be used to construct close-to-optimal transport properties irrespective of the system size.",13,[],6
1303.2328,quant-ph,"We present a method to efficiently compute the eigenfunctions of classically chaotic systems. The key point is the definition of a modified Gram-Schmidt procedure which selects the most suitable elements from a basis set of scar functions localized along the shortest periodic orbits of the system. In this way, one benefits from the semiclassical dynamical properties of such functions. The performance of the method is assessed by presenting an application to a quartic two dimensional oscillator whose classical dynamics are highly chaotic. We have been able to compute the eigenfunctions of the system using a small basis set. An estimate of the basis size is obtained from the mean participation ratio. A thorough analysis of the results using different indicators, such as eigenstate reconstruction in the local representation, scar intensities, participation ratios, and error bounds, is also presented.",13,[],6
1305.5528,quant-ph,"We provide a non-deterministic quantum protocol that approximates the single qubit rotations Rx(2a2 b2)$ using Rx(2a) and Rx(2b) and a constant number of Clifford and T operations. We then use this method to construct a ""floating point"" implementation of a small rotation wherein we use the aforementioned method to construct the exponent part of the rotation and also to combine it with a mantissa. This causes the cost of the synthesis to depend more strongly on the relative (rather than absolute) precision required. We analyze the mean and variance of the \Tcount required to use our techniques and provide new lower bounds for the T-count for ancilla free synthesis of small single-qubit axial rotations. We further show that our techniques can use ancillas to beat these lower bounds with high probability. We also discuss the T-depth of our method and see that the vast majority of the cost of the resultant circuits can be shifted to parallel computation paths.",13,[],6
1306.4801,quant-ph,"Bit commitment is a fundamental cryptographic primitive in which Bob wishes to commit a secret bit to Alice. Perfectly secure bit commitment has been proven impossible through asynchronous exchange of classical and quantum information. Perfect security is however possible by restraining the exchange of classical and quantum information to suitably chosen relativistic constraints. This requires Alice (and Bob) to split into two remote agents performing space-like separated classical communication, and in one agent exchanging quantum bits with the other party. The duration of the commitment is given by the distance between the two remote agents. The original protocol requires the quantum communication to happen at a precise location and time with respect to the classical communication. We show how the protocol can be modified to relax this constraint such that the quantum part of the protocol can be performed at any time before the actual commitment, making it much more practical. Finally, we present an experimental demonstration of this protocol realized with a commercial quantum key distribution system and with synchronized classical agents located in Geneva and Singapore, yielding a commitment time of 15 ms. Our work includes a complete security analysis, accounting for experimental imperfections (multi-photon emission, transmission loss, detector inefficiency and dark counts) and finite statistics.",13,[],6

1311.1536,quant-ph,"In this paper, we consider the problem of discriminating quantum states by local operations and classical communication (LOCC) when an arbitrarily small amount of error is permitted. This paradigm is known as asymptotic state discrimination, and we derive necessary conditions for when two multipartite states of any size can be discriminated perfectly by asymptotic LOCC. We use this new criterion to prove a gap in the LOCC and separable distinguishability norms. We then turn to the operational advantage of using two-way classical communication over one-way communication in LOCC processing. With a simple two-qubit product state ensemble, we demonstrate a strict majorization of the two-way LOCC norm over the one-way norm.",13,[],6
1311.4213,quant-ph,We propose a new characterization of non-Markovian quantum evolution based on the concept of non-Markovianity degree. It provides an analog of a Schmidt number in the entanglement theory and reveals the formal analogy between quantum evolution and the entanglement theory: Markovian evolution corresponds to a separable state and non-Markovian one is further characterized by its degree. It enables one to introduce a non-Markovinity witness -- an analog of an entanglement witness -- and a family of measures -- an analog of Schmidt coefficients -- and finally to characterize maximally non-Markovian evolution being an analog of maximally entangled state. Our approach allows to classify the non-Markovianity measures introduced so far in a unified rigorous mathematical framework.,13,[],6
1304.7092,quant-ph,"The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) experiment was a benchmark in quantum optics, evidencing the quantum nature of the photon. In order to go deeper, and obtain the complete information about the quantum state of a system, for instance, composed by photons, the direct measurement or reconstruction of the Wigner function or other quasi--probability distribution in phase space is necessary. In the present paper, we show that a simple modification in the well-known HOM experiment provides the direct measurement of the Wigner function. We apply our results to a widely used quantum optics system, consisting of the biphoton generated in the parametric down conversion process. In this approach, a negative value of the Wigner function is a sufficient condition for non-gaussian entanglement between two photons. In the general case, the Wigner function provides all the required information to infer entanglement using well known necessary and sufficient criteria. We analyze our results using two examples of parametric down conversion processes taken from recent experiments.

1306.5625,quant-ph,"Energy diffusion due to spontaneous localization (SL) for a relativistically-fast moving particle is examined. SL is an alternative to standard quantum theory in which quantum state reduction is treated as a random physical process which is incorporated into the Schrodinger equation in an observer-independent way. These models make predictions in conflict with standard quantum theory one of which is non conservation of energy. On the basis of proposed relativistic extensions of SL it is argued that for a single localized particle, non-relativistic SL should remain valid in the rest frame of the particle. The implication is that relativistic calculations can be performed by transforming non-relativistic results from the particle rest frame to the frame of an inertial observer. This is demonstrated by considering a relativistic stream of non-interacting particles of cosmological origin and showing how their energy distribution evolves as a result of SL as they traverse the Universe. A solution is presented and the potential for astrophysical observations is discussed.",13,[],6

Precise coherent manipulations of the collective ground and single Rydberg excitation states of an atomic ensemble requires the knowledge of the number of atoms with small uncertainty. We present an efficient method to acquire such information by interrogating the atomic ensemble with resonant pulses while monitoring the resulting Rydberg excitations. We show that after several such steps accompanied by feedback the number of atoms in an ensemble can be assessed with high accuracy.

1306.4062,quant-ph,"We report on theoretical research in photonic cluster-state computing. Finding optimal schemes of generating non-classical photonic states is of critical importance for this field as physically implementable photon-photon entangling operations are currently limited to measurement-assisted stochastic transformations. A critical parameter for assessing the efficiency of such transformations is the success probability of a desired measurement outcome. At present there are several experimental groups which are capable of generating multi-photon cluster states carrying more than eight qubits. Separate photonic qubits or small clusters can be fused into a single cluster state by a probabilistic optical CZ gate conditioned on simultaneous detection of all photons with 1/9 success probability of each gate. This design mechanically follows the original theoretical scheme of cluster state generation proposed more than a decade ago by Raussendorf, Browne and Briegel. The optimality of the destructive CZ gate in application to linear optical cluster state generation has not been analyzed previously. Our results reveal that this method is far from the optimal one. Employing numerical optimization we have identified that maximal success probability of fusing n unentangled dual-rail optical qubits into a linear cluster state is equal to 1/2(n-1); m-tuple of photonic Bell pair states, commonly generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion, can be fused into a single cluster with the maximal success probability of 1/4(m-1).",13,[],6

At the same time the evolution of constituent spins under the laser influence is studied quantum mechanically.

1305.2948,quant-ph,"In eliminating the fair sampling assumption, the Greenberger, Horne, Zeilinger (GHZ) theorem is believed to confirm Bell's historic conclusion that local hidden variables are inconsistent with the results of quantum mechanics. The GHZ theorem depends on predicting the results of sets of measurements of which only one may be performed. In the present paper, the non-commutative aspects of these unperformed measurements are critically examined. Classical examples and the logic of the GHZ construction are analyzed to demonstrate that combined counterfactual results of non-commuting operations are in general logically inconsistent with performed measurement sequences whose results depend on non-commutation. The Bell theorem is also revisited in the light of this result.

We specifically look into two entanglement characteristics, the logarithmic negativity as a measure of entanglement and the teleportation fidelity as a usefulness of entanglement, for each distilled state.

1306.5492,quant-ph,"We propose a novel interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, which can resolve the outstanding conflict between the principles of locality and realism and offers new insight on the so-called weak values of physical observables. The discussion is presented in the context of Bohm's system of two photons in their singlet polarization state in which the Einstein-Podolski-Rosen paradox is commonly addressed. It is shown that quantum states can be understood as statistical mixtures of non-interfering pseudo-classical paths in a \it hidden phase space, in a way that overcomes the implicit assumptions of Bell's theorem and reproduces all expected values and correlations. The polarization properties of the photons along these paths are gauge-dependent magnitudes, whose actual values get fixed only after a reference direction is set by the observer of either photon A or B. Furthermore, these values are not constrained to fulfill standard classical algebraic relationships. These \it hidden paths can be grouped into coarser ones consistent with particular post-selection conditions for a complete set of commuting observables and along which every physical observable gets on average its corresponding weak value. Obviously, different sets of commuting observables lead to different coarse statistical representations of the same quantum state. This interpretation follows from the observation that in the Heisenberg picture of a closed quantum system in state equation every physical observable equation can be represented by an operator equation within a commutative algebra, such that equation. The formalism presented here may become a useful tool for performing numerical simulations of quantum systems.",13,[],6

In particular, we treat the completely positive and trace preserving map on the system as a quantum channel, and study the truncation of the channel by truncating its Kraus set and its output dimension. We thereby derive the truncated transition amplitudes of the corresponding truncated channel. Finally, we give a computable approximation for these truncated transition amplitudes with explicit error bounds, and perform a case study of the oscillators in the off-resonant and weakly-coupled regime numerically.

The disorder is modeled by introducing an extra random aspect to QRW, a classical coin that randomly dictates which quantum coin drives the system's time evolution.

Consequently some form of nonlinearity is required to gain any advantage beyond estimation alone. This result holds true in both quantum and classical systems, with non-stationary forces and feedback, and in the general case of non-Gaussian and correlated noise.

The fidelities can be determined by averaging the sampling functions over quadrature statistics measured by homodyne detection. The sampling functions are designed such that they can compensate for losses and inefficient homodyning provided that the overall efficiency exceeds certain threshold. The fidelity with an odd coherent state and the fidelity with a squeezed odd Fock state provide convenient witnesses of negativity of Wigner function of the measured state. The negativity of Wigner function at the origin of phase space is certified if any of these fidelities exceeds 0.5.

Finally, by considering a way to deterministically simulate these acausal gates, we investigate a general framework to analyze the trade-off between the spacial and temporal resources for quantum computation.",13,[],6
1312.6437,quant-ph,"In interiors of celestial objects matter is subdued to extremely high values of pressure.Theoretical analysis of the behaviour of atoms and molecules under high pressure is a complex quantum mechanical and statistical problem. The aim of the present letter is to demonstrate, on a known one-dimensional quantum mechanical system, the reality of excitation and ultimately ionisation of atoms and/or molecules under the influence of high external pressure.",13,[],6
1310.0750,quant-ph,"By removing a equation atom from the tetrahedral configuration of the diamond, replace it by a equation atom, and repeating this in a linear direction, it is possible to have a linear chain of nuclear spins one half and to build a solid state quantum computer. One qubit rotation and controlled-not (CNOT) quantum gates are obtained immediately from this configuration, and CNOT quantum gate is used to determined the design parameters of this quantum computer.",13,[],6
