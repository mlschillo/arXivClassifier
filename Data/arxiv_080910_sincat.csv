0810.0321,astro-ph,"Images made with the VLBA have resolved the region in a nearby radio galaxy, Pictor A, where the relativistic jet that originates at the nucleus terminates in an interaction with the intergalactic medium, a so-called radio galaxy hot spot. This image provides the highest spatial resolution view of such an object to date (16 pc), more than three times better than previous VLBI observations of similar objects. The north-west Pictor A hot spot is resolved into a complex set of compact components, seen to coincide with the bright part of the hot spot imaged at arcsecond-scale resolution with the VLA. In addition to a comparison with VLA data, we compare our VLBA results with data from the HST and Chandra telescopes, as well as new Spitzer data. The presence of pc-scale components in the hot spot, identifying regions containing strong shocks in the fluid flow, leads us to explore the suggestion that they represent sites of synchrotron X-ray production, contributing to the integrated X-ray flux of the hot spot, along with X-rays from synchrotron self-Compton scattering. This scenario provides a natural explanation for the radio morphology of the hot spot and its integrated X-ray emission, leading to very different predictions for the higher energy X-ray spectrum compared to previous studies. From the sizes of the individual pc-scale components and their angular spread, we estimate that the jet width at the hot spot is in the range 70 - 700 pc, which is comparable to similar estimates in PKS 2153-69, 3C 205, and 4C 41.17. The lower limit in this range arises from the suggestion that the jet may dither in its direction as it passes through hot spot backflow material close to the jet termination point, creating a ""dentist drill"" effect on the inside of a cavity 700 pc in diameter.",08,[],1
0808.1151,astro-ph,"We present a distance measurement for the semiregular variable S Crateris (S Crt) based on its annual parallax. With the unique dual beam system of the VLBI Exploration for Radio Astrometry (VERA) telescopes, we measured the absolute proper motion of a water maser spot associated with S Crt, referred to the quasar J1147-0724 located at an angular separation of 1.23equation. In observations spanning nearly two years, we have detected the maser spot at the LSR velocity of 34.7 km sequation, for which we measured the annual parallax of 2.33equation0.13 mas corresponding to a distance of 430equation pc. This measurement has an accuracy one order of magnitude better than the parallax measurements of HIPPARCOS. The angular distribution and three-dimensional velocity field of maser spots indicate a bipolar outflow with the flow axis along northeast-southwest direction. Using the distance and photospheric temperature, we estimate the stellar radius of S Crt and compare it with those of Mira variables.",08,[],1
0812.4859,astro-ph,"Pulsating subdwarf B stars oscillate in short-period equation-modes or long-period equation-modes. HS 0702  6043 is one of currently three objects known to show characteristics of both types and hence is classified as hybrid pulsator. We briefly present our analysis of the equation-mode domain of this star, but focus on first results from long-term photometric monitoring in particular of the equation-mode oscillations. We present a high-resolution frequency spectrum, and report on our efforts to construct a multi-season O--C diagram. Additionally to the standard (although nontrivial) exercise in asteroseismology to probe the instantaneous inner structure of a star, measured changes in the pulsation frequencies as derived from an O--C diagram can be compared to theoretical evolutionary timescales. Within the EXOTIME program, we also use this same data to search for planetary companions around extreme horizontal branch objects.",08,[],1
0810.1251,astro-ph,"The discovery of the eccentric binary and millisecond pulsar PSR J190303273 has raised interesting questions about the formation mechanisms of this peculiar system. Here we present a born-fast scenario for PSR J190303273. We assume that during the supernova (SN) explosion that produced the pulsar, a fallback disk was formed around and accreted onto the newborn neutron star. Mass accretion could accelerate the neutron star's spin to milliseconds, and decrease its magnetic field to equation G, provided that there was sufficient mass (equation) in the fallback disk. The neutron star became a millisecond pulsar after mass accretion terminated. In the meanwhile the binary orbit has kept to be eccentric (due to the SN explosion) for equation yr. We have performed population synthesis calculations of the evolutions of neutron stars with a fallback disk, and found that there might be tens to hundreds of PSR J190303273-like systems in the Galaxy. This scenario also suggests that some fraction of isolated millisecond pulsars in the Galactic disk could be formed through the same channel.",08,[],1
0810.4855,astro-ph,"(Shortened) CONTEXT: [...] GRB060614 is the first nearby long duration GRB clearly not associated to a bright Ib/c supernova. Moreover, its duration (T90 ~ 100s) makes it hardly classifiable as a short GRB. It presents strong similarities with GRB970228, the prototype of the new class of ""fake"" short GRBs that appear to originate from the coalescence of binary neutron stars or white dwarfs spiraled out into the galactic halo. AIMS: Within the ""canonical"" GRB scenario based on the ""fireshell"" model, we test if GRB060614 can be a ""fake"" or ""disguised"" short GRB. [...] METHODS: We fit GRB060614 light curves in Swift's BAT (15-150keV) and XRT (0.2-10keV) energy bands. Within the fireshell model, light curves are formed by two well defined and different components: the Proper-GRB (P-GRB), emitted at the fireshell transparency, and the extended afterglow, due to the interaction between the leftover accelerated baryonic and leptonic shell and the CBM. RESULTS: We determine the two free parameters describing the GRB source within the fireshell model. [...] A small average CBM density [...] is inferred, typical of galactic halos. The first spikelike emission is identified with the P-GRB and the following prolonged emission with the extended afterglow peak.[...] CONCLUSIONS: The anomalous GRB060614 finds a natural interpretation within our canonical GRB scenario: it is a ""disguised"" short GRB. [...] This result points to an old binary system, likely formed by a white dwarf and a neutron star, as the progenitor of GRB060614 and well justify the absence of an associated SN Ib/c. Particularly important for further studies of the final merging process are the temporal structures in the P-GRB down to 0.1s.",08,[],1
0801.2518,astro-ph,"We present GOSSIP (Galaxy Observed-Simulated SED Interactive Program), a new tool developed to perform SED fitting in a simple, user friendly and efficient way. GOSSIP automatically builds-up the observed SED of an object (or a large sample of objects) combining magnitudes in different bands and eventually a spectrum; then it performs a chi-square minimization fitting procedure versus a set of synthetic models. The fitting results are used to estimate a number of physical parameters like the Star Formation History, absolute magnitudes, stellar mass and their Probability Distribution Functions. User defined models can be used, but GOSSIP is also able to load models produced by the most commonly used synthesis population codes. GOSSIP can be used interactively with other visualization tools using the PLASTIC protocol for communications. Moreover, since it has been developed with large data sets applications in mind, it will be extended to operate within the Virtual Observatory framework. GOSSIP is distributed to the astronomical community from the PANDORA group web site (http://cosmos.iasf-milano.inaf.it/pandora/gossip.html)",08,[],1
0807.3553,astro-ph,"Various radio observations have showed that the hot atmospheres of galaxy clusters are magnetized. However, our understanding of the origin of these magnetic fields, their implications on structure formation and their interplay with the dynamics of the cluster atmosphere, especially in the centers of galaxy clusters is still very limited. In preparation to the upcoming new generation of radio telescopes (like EVLA, LWA, LOFAR and SKA), a huge effort is being made to learn more about cosmological magnetic fields from the observational perspective. Here we present the implementation of magneto hydrodynamics in the cosmological SPH code GADGET. We discuss the details of the implementation and various schemes to suppress numerical instabilities as well as regularization schemes, in the context of cosmological simulations. The performance of the SPH MHD code is demonstrated in various one and two dimensional test problems, which we performed if a fully, three dimensional setup to test the code under realistic circumstances. Comparing with solutions obtained with ATHENA, we find excellent agreement with our SPH MHD implementation. Finally we apply our SPH MHD implementation to forming galaxy clusters within a large, cosmological box. Performing a resolution study we demonstrate the robustness of the predicted shape of the magnetic field profiles in galaxy clusters, which is in good agreement with previous studies.",08,[],1
0805.4289,astro-ph,"Our simultaneous multicolor (UBVRI) circular polarimetry has revealed nearly sinusoidal variation over the WD spin cycle, and almost symmetric positive and negative polarization excursions. Maximum amplitudes are observed in the B and V bands (-3 %). This is the first time that polarization peaking in the blue has been discovered in an IP, and suggests that V405 Aur is the highest magnetic field IP found so far. The polarized flux spectrum is similar to those found in polars with magnetic fields in the range B ~ 25-50 MG. Our low resolution circular spectropolarimetry has given evidence of transient features which can be fitted by cyclotron harmonics n = 6, 7, and 8, at a field of B = 31.5 - 0.8 MG, consistent with the broad-band polarized flux spectrum. Timings of the circular polarization zero crossovers put strict upper limits on WD spin period changes and indicate that the WD in V405 Aur is currently accreting closely at the spin equilibrium rate, with very long synchronization timescales, Ts > 109 yr. For the observed spin to orbital period ratio, Pspin/Porb = 0.0365, and Porb ~ 4.15 hr, existing numerical accretion models predict spin equilibrium condition with B ~ 30 MG if the mass ratio of the binary components is q1 ~ 0.4. The high magnetic field makes V405 Aur a likely candidate as a progenitor of a polar.",08,[],1
0810.1723,astro-ph,"We report techniques and results of a Palomar 200-inch (5 m) adaptive optics imaging survey of sub-stellar companions to solar-type stars. The survey consists of Ks coronagraphic observations of 21 FGK dwarfs out to 20 pc (median distance about 17 pc). At 1-arcsec separation (17 projected AU) from a typical target system, the survey achieves median sensitivities 7 mag fainter than the parent star. In terms of companion mass, that corresponds to sensitivities of 50MJ (1 Gyr), 70MJ (solar age), and 75MJ (10 Gyr), using the evolutionary models of Baraffe and colleagues. Using common proper motion to distinguish companions from field stars, we find that no system shows positive evidence of a previously unknown substellar companion (searchable separation about 20-250 projected AU at the median target distance).",08,[],1
0801.2120,astro-ph,"We analyze the distribution of G and K type stars towards the Galactic poles using RAVE and ELODIE radial velocities, 2MASS photometric star counts, and UCAC2 proper motions. The combination of photometric and 3D kinematic data allows us to disentangle and describe the vertical distribution of dwarfs, sub-giants and giants and their kinematics. We identify discontinuities within the kinematics and magnitude counts that separate the thin disk, thick disk and a hotter component. The respective scale heights of the thin disk and thick disk are 225equation10 pc and 1048equation36 pc. We also constrain the luminosity function and the kinematic distribution function. The existence of a kinematic gap between the thin and thick disks is incompatible with the thick disk having formed from the thin disk by a continuous process, such as scattering of stars by spiral arms or molecular clouds. Other mechanisms of formation of the thick disk such as `created on the spot' or smoothly `accreted' remain compatible with our findings.",08,[],1
0802.3353,astro-ph,"We present a study of the distribution of [O III] equation5007 and [O II] equation3727 emission in the Narrow Line Region (NLR) of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151. While the NLR of NGC 4151 exhibits an overall structure consistent with the unified model of Seyfert galaxies, narrow-band [O III] and [O II] images obtained with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 aboard the Hubble Space Telescope reveal significant emission from outside the the emission-line bi-cone. The [O III]/[O II] ratios are lower in these regions, consistent with a weaker ionizing flux. We performed a photoionization modeling analysis of the emission-line gas within a series of annuli, centered on the the central continuum source, with inner radii from 13 to 90 pc. The gas is ionized by radiation that has been attenuated by a relatively highly-ionized absorber (HABS), which completely covers the central source, and a lower-ionization absorber (LABS), which has a covering factor ranging from 0 to 1. We found that the [O III]/[O II] ratios are well fit by assuming that, within each segment of an annulus, some fraction of the NLR gas is completely within the shadow of LABS, while the rest is irradiated by the continuum filtered only by HABS. This suggests that the structure of the NLR is due to filtering of the ionizing radiation by ionized gas, consistent with disk-wind models. One possible scenario is that the low-ionization absorbers are dense knots of gas swept up by a wind.",08,[],1
0806.1317,astro-ph,"An overview is given of the properties of the various kinds of quasi-periodic luminosity modulations observed in cataclysmic variables (CVs). The two principal types, known in the CV literature as dwarf nova oscillations and quasi-periodic oscillations, have similarities to the high and low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in X-Ray binaries. There is a further well observed class known as longer period dwarf nova oscillations. In CVs the observed interrelations between these oscillations suggests a model of magnetically controlled accretion onto a rapidly rotating equatorial belt of accreted gas. Non-radial oscillations of the central white dwarf are observed in some systems.",08,[],1
0809.4552,astro-ph,"abridged) In this paper we present new redshifts for 747 galaxies in 23 ESO Imaging Survey (EIS) cluster fields. We use the ""gap""-technique to search for significant overdensities in redshift space for identifying groups/clusters of galaxies. In this way we spectroscopically confirm systems in 10 of the 23 cluster candidate fields with a matched-filter estimated redshift zMF=0.3-0.4 and with spectroscopic redshifts in the range from z=0.158 to z=0.534. We find that the systems identified in the present paper span a broad range of one-dimensional velocity dispersion (175-497 km/s) and richness (12L*<=L<=65L*). Both undersampling and contamination by substructures contribute to the uncertainty of these measurements. From the analysis of the colours of the galaxy populations we find that ~60% of the spectroscopically confirmed systems have a ""significant"" red sequence with a colour matching passive stellar evolution models. With this paper we complete our spectroscopic survey of the fields of 58 EIS cluster candidates with estimated redshifts z<=0.4. We have measured a total of 1954 galaxy redshifts in the range z=0.0065 to z=0.6706. Of the 58 systems we confirm 42 (~75%) with redshifts between z=0.095 and z=0.534.",08,[],1

0801.3745,astro-ph,"We describe the HST ACS Coma cluster Treasury survey, a deep two-passband imaging survey of one of the nearest rich clusters of galaxies, the Coma cluster (Abell 1656).   The survey was designed to cover an area of 740 square arcmin in regions of different density of both galaxies and intergalactic medium within the cluster. The ACS failure of January 27th 2007 leaves the survey 28% complete, with 21 ACS pointings (230 square arcmin) complete, and partial data for a further 4 pointings (44 square arcmin).   Predicted survey depth for 10 sigma detections for optimal photometry of point sources is g' = 27.6 in the F475W filter, and IC=26.8 mag in F814 (AB magnitudes). Initial simulations with artificially injected point sources show 90% recovered at magnitude limits of g' = 27.55 and IC = 26.65. For extended sources, the predicted 10 sigma limits for a 1 square arcsecond region are g' = 25.8 mag/sq. arcsec and IC = 25.0 mag/sq. arcsec.   We highlight several motivating science goals of the survey, including study of the faint end of the cluster galaxy luminosity function, structural parameters of dwarf galaxies, stellar populations and their effect on colors and color gradients, evolution of morphological components in a dense environment, the nature of ultra compact dwarf galaxies, and globular cluster populations of cluster galaxies of a range of luminosities and types.

0810.0441,astro-ph,"Because of the dynamic nature of the interstellar medium, the Sun should have encountered a variety of different interstellar environments in its lifetime. As the solar wind interacts with the surrounding interstellar medium to form a heliosphere, different heliosphere shapes, sizes, and particle contents result from the different environments. Some of the large possible interstellar parameter space (density, velocity, temperature) is explored here with the help of global heliosphere models, and the features in the resulting heliospheres are compared and discussed. The heliospheric size, expressed as distance of the nose of the heliopause to the Sun, is set by the solar wind - interstellar pressure balance, even for extreme cases. Other heliospheric boundary locations and neutral particle results correlate with the interstellar parameters as well. If the H0 clouds identified in the Millennium Arecibo survey are typical of clouds encountered by the Sun, then the Sun spends ~99.4% of the time in warm low density ISM, where the typical upwind heliosphere radii are up to two orders of magnitude larger than at present.",08,[],1
0808.3111,astro-ph,"Recent observations of carbon, sulphur, and titanium isotopes at redshifts z~1 and in the local stellar disc and halo have opened a new window into the study of isotopic abundance patterns and the origin of the chemical elements. Using our Galactic chemical evolution code GEtool, we have examined the evolution of these isotopes within the framework of a Milky Way-like system. We have three aims in this work: first, to test the claim that novae are required, in order to explain the carbon isotope patterns in the Milky Way; second, to test the claim that sulphur isotope patterns at high-redshift require an initial mass function biased towards massive stars; and third, to test extant chemical evolution models against new observations of titanium isotopes that suggest an anti-correlation between trace-to-dominant isotopes with metallicity. Based upon our dual-infall galactic chemical evolution modelling of a Milky Way-like system, and the subsequent comparison with these new and unique datasets, we conclude the following: novae are not required to understand the evolution of 12C/13C in the solar neighbourhood; a massive star-biased initial mass function is consistent with the low ratios of 12C/13C and 32S/34S seen in one high-redshift late-type spiral, but the consequent super-solar metallicity prediction for the interstellar medium in this system seems highly unlikely; and deficient isotopes of titanium are predicted to correlate positively with metallicity, in apparent disagreement with the new datasets; if confirmed, classical chemical evolution models of the Milky Way (and the associated supernovae nucleosynthetic yields) may need a substantial overhaul to be made consistent.",08,[],1
0805.2399,astro-ph,"The star XO-5 (GSC 02959-00729, V=12.1, G8V) hosts a Jupiter-sized, Rp=1.15/-0.12 Rjup, transiting extrasolar planet, XO-5b, with an orbital period of P=4.187732/-0.00002 days. The planet mass (Mp=1.15/-0.08 Mjup) and surface gravity (gp=22/-5 m/s2) are significantly larger than expected by empirical Mp-P and Mp-P-[Fe/H] relationships. However, the deviation from the Mp-P relationship for XO-5b is not large enough to suggest a distinct type of planet as is suggested for GJ 436b, HAT-P-2b, and XO-3b.

0804.1821,astro-ph,"We have analysed, for the first time, the clustering properties of Wolf-Rayet (W-R) galaxies, using a large sample of 846 W-R galaxies selected from the Data Release 4 (DR4) of the SDSS. We compute the cross-correlation function between W-R galaxies and a reference sample of galaxies drawn from the DR4. We compare the function to the results for control samples of non-W-R star-forming galaxies that are matched closely in redshift, luminosity, concentration, 4000-\AA break strength and specific star formation rate (SSFR). On scales larger than a few Mpc, W-R galaxies have almost the same clustering amplitude as the control samples, indicating that W-R galaxies and non-W-R control galaxies populate dark matter haloes of similar masses. On scales between 0.1--1equation Mpc, W-R galaxies are less clustered than the control samples, and the size of the difference depends on the SSFR. Based on both observational and theoretical considerations, we speculate that this negative bias can be interpreted by W-R galaxies residing preferentially at the centers of their dark matter haloes. We examine the distribution of W-R galaxies more closely using the SDSS galaxy group catalogue of Yang et al., and find that equation82% of our W-R galaxies are the central galaxies of groups, compared to equation74% for the corresponding control galaxies. We find that W-R galaxies are hosted, on average, by dark matter haloes of masses ofequation, compared to equation for centrally-located W-R galaxies and equation for satellite ones. We would like to point out that this finding, which provides a direct observational support to our conjecture, is really very crude due to the small number of W-R galaxies and the incompleteness of the group catalogue, and needs more work in future with larger samples.",08,[],1
0807.0231,astro-ph,"We present a Gaussianity analysis of the WMAP 5-year Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropy data maps. We use several third order estimators based on the spherical Mexican hat wavelet. We impose constraints on the local non-linear coupling parameter fnl using well motivated non-Gaussian simulations. We analyse the WMAP maps at resolution of 6.9 arcmin for the Q, V, and W frequency bands. We use the KQ75 mask recommended by the WMAP team which masks out 28% of the sky. The wavelet coefficients are evaluated at 10 different scales from 6.9 to 150 arcmin. With these coefficients we compute the third order estimators which are used to perform a chi-squared analysis. The chi-squared statistic is used to test the Gaussianity of the WMAP data as well as to constrain the fnl parameter. Our results indicate that the WMAP data are compatible with the Gaussian simulations, and the fnl parameter is constrained to -8 < fnl < 111 at 95% CL for the combined VW map. This value has been corrected for the presence of undetected point sources, which add a positive contribution of Deltafnl = 3-5 in the VW map.

0801.2245,astro-ph,"We have carried out an accurate investigation of the Ca isotopic composition and stratification in the atmospheres of 23 magnetic chemically peculiar (Ap) stars of different temperature and magnetic field strength. With the UVES spectrograph at the 8m ESO VLT, we have obtained high-resolution spectra of Ap stars in the wavelength range 3000-10000 A. Using a detailed spectrum synthesis calculations, we have reproduced a variety of Ca lines in the optical and ultraviolet spectral regions, inferring the overall vertical distribution of Ca abundance, then we have deduced the relative isotopic composition and its dependence on height using the profile of the the IR-triplet Ca II line at lambda 8498 A. In 22 out of 23 studied stars, we found that Ca is strongly stratified, being usually overabundant by 1.0-1.5 dex below log tau5000 ~ -1, and strongly depleted above log tau5000 = -1.5. The IR-triplet Ca II line at lambda 8498 A reveals a significant contribution of the heavy isotopes 46Ca and 48Ca, which represent less than 1% of the terrestrial Ca isotopic mixture. We confirm our previous finding that the presence of heavy Ca isotopes is generally anticorrelated with the magnetic field strength. Moreover, we discover that in Ap stars with relatively small surface magnetic fields (<=4-5 kG), the light isotope 40Ca is concentrated close to the photosphere, while the heavy isotopes are dominant in the outer atmospheric layers. This vertical isotopic separation, observed for the first time for any metal in a stellar atmosphere, disappears in stars with magnetic field strength above 6-7 kG. We suggest that the overall Ca stratification and depth-dependent isotopic anomaly observed in Ap stars may be attributed to a combined action of the radiatively-driven diffusion and light-induced drift.",08,[],1

0802.4048,astro-ph,"We present a mechanism for chondrules to stick together by means of compaction of a porous dust rim they sweep up as they move through the dusty nebula gas. It is shown that dust aggregates formed out of micron-sized grains stick to chondrules, forming a porous dust rim. When chondrules collide, this dust can be compacted by means of rolling motions within the porous dust layer. This mechanism dissipates the collisional energy, compacting the rim and allowing chondrules to stick. The structure of the obtained chondrule-dust agglomerates (referred to as compounds) then consists of three phases: chondrules, porous dust, and dust that has been compacted by collisions. Subsequently, these compounds accrete their own dust and collide with other compounds. The evolution of the compound size distribution and the relative importance of the phases is calculated by a Monte Carlo code. Growth ends, and a simulation is terminated when all the dust in the compounds has been compacted. Numerous runs are performed, reflecting the uncertainty in the physical conditions at the chondrule formation time. It is found that compounds can grow by 1-2 orders of magnitudes in radius, upto dm-sizes when turbulence levels are low. However, relative velocities associated with radial drift form a barrier for further growth. Earlier findings that the dust sweep-up by chondrules is proportional to their sizes are confirmed. We contrast two scenarios regarding how this dust evolved further towards the densely packed rims seen in chondrites.",08,[],1
0809.3839,astro-ph,"Circularly polarized 3.5 cm continuum emission was detected toward three radio sources in the R CrA region using the Very Large Array. The Class I protostar IRS 5b persistently showed polarized radio emission with a constant helicity over 8 yr, which suggests that its magnetosphere has a stable configuration. There is a good correlation between the Stokes I and Stokes V fluxes, and the fractional polarization is about 0.17. During active phases the fractional polarization is a weakly decreasing function of Stokes I flux, which suggests that IRS 5b is phenomenologically similar to other types of flare stars such as RS CVn binaries. The variability timescale of the polarized flux is about a month, and the magnetosphere of IRS 5b must be very large in size. The Class I protostar IRS 7A was detected once in circularly polarized radio emission, even though IRS 7A drives a thermal radio jet. This detection implies that the radio emission from the magnetosphere of a young protostar can escape the absorption by the partially ionized wind at least once in a while. The properties of IRS 7A and IRS 5b suggests that Class I protostars have organized peristellar magnetic fields of a few kilogauss and that the detectability of magnetospheric emission may depend on the evolutionary status of protostar. Also reported is the detection of circularly polarized radio emission toward the variable radio source B5.",08,[],1

We aimed at identifying the companion star of IGR J18483-0311 to discriminate between the BeXB and the SFXT nature of the source. Optical and near-infrared photometry, as well as near-infrared spectroscopy of the companion star were performed to identify its spectral type. We also assembled and fitted its broad-band spectral energy distribution to derive its physical parameters. We show that the companion star of IGR J18483-0311 is an early-B supergiant, likely a B0.5Ia, and that its distance is about 3-4 kpc. The early-B supergiant nature of its companion star, as well as its fast X-ray transient activity point towards an SFXT nature of IGR J18483-0311. Nevertheless, the long duration and the periodicity of its outbursts, as well as its high level of quiescence, are consistent with IGR J18483-0311 being an intermediate SFXT, in between classical supergiant X-ray binaries (SGXBs) characterised by small and circular orbits, and classical SFXTs with large and eccentric orbits.",08,[],1

0805.3613,astro-ph,"NGC 6782 is an early-type barred spiral galaxy exhibiting a rich and complex morphology with multiple ring patterns. To provide a physical understanding of its structure and kinematical properties, two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations have been carried out. Numerical calculations reveal that the striking features in NGC 6782 can be reproduced provided that the gas flow is governed by the gravitational potential associated with a slowly rotating strong bar. In particular, the response of the gaseous disk to the bar potential leads to the excitation of spiral density waves at the inner Lindblad resonance giving rise to the appearance of a nearly circular nuclear ring with a pair of dust lanes. For a sufficiently strong bar potential, the inner 4:1 spiral density waves are also excited. The interaction of the higher harmonic waves with the waves excited at the inner Lindblad resonance and confined by the outer Lindblad resonance results in the observed diamond-shaped (or pointy oval) inner ring structure. The overall gas morphology and kinematical features are both well reproduced by the model provided that the pattern speed of the bar is equation km sequation kpcequation.",08,[],1
0812.2259,astro-ph,"We use measurements of the growth of cosmic structure, as inferred from the observed evolution of the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of galaxy clusters, to constrain departures from General Relativity (GR) on cosmological scales. We employ the popular growth rate parameterization, Omegam(z)gamma, for which GR predicts a growth index gamma~0.55. We use observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), type Ia supernovae (SNIa), and X-ray cluster gas-mass fractions (fgas), to simultaneously constrain the expansion history and energy content of the Universe, as described by the background model parameters: Omegam, w, and Omegak, i.e., the mean matter density, the dark energy equation of state parameter, and the mean curvature, respectively. Using conservative allowances for systematic uncertainties, in particular for the evolution of the mass-luminosity scaling relation in the XLF analysis, we find gamma=0.510.16-0.15 and Omegam=0.27-0.02 (68.3 per cent confidence limits), for a flat cosmological constant (LCDM) background model. Allowing w to be a free parameter, we find gamma=0.440.17-0.15. Relaxing the flatness prior in the LCDM model, we obtain gamma=0.510.19-0.16. When in addition to the XLF data we use the CMB data to constrain gamma through the ISW effect, we obtain a combined constraint of gamma=0.450.14-0.12 for the flat LCDM model. Our analysis provides the tightest constraints to date on the growth index. We find no evidence for departures from General Relativity on cosmological scales.",08,[],1
0802.3806,astro-ph,"Various observatories around the globe started regular full-disk imaging of the solar atmosphere in the Ca II K line since the early decades of the 20th century. The archives made by these observations have the potential of providing far more detailed information on solar magnetism than just the sunspot number and area records to which most studies of solar activity and irradiance changes are restricted. We evaluate the image contents of three Ca II K spectroheliogram time-series, specifically those obtained by the digitization of the Arcetri, Kodaikanal, and Mt Wilson photographic archives. We describe the main problems afflicting these data and analyze their quality by expressing the image contents through several quantities. We compare the results obtained with those for similar present-day observations taken with the Meudon spectroheliograph and with the Rome-PSPT. We show that historic data suffer from stronger geometrical distortions and photometric uncertainties than similar present-day observations. The latter uncertainties mostly originate from the photographic calibration of the original data and from stray-light effects. We also show that the image contents of the three analyzed series vary in time. These variations are probably due to instrument changes and aging of the spectrographs used, as well as changes of the observing programs. Our results imply that the main challenge for the analysis of historic data is their accurate photometric calibration. This problem must be solved before they can provide reliable information about solar magnetism and activity over the last century. Moreover, inter-calibration of results obtained from independent time-series is required to reliably trace changes of solar properties with time from the analysis of such data.",08,[],1

Giving access to galaxies with a wide range of luminosities out to high redshifts, these surveys include many faint galaxies with significantly sub-solar metallicities.   We use our chemically consistent galaxy evolutionary synthesis code GALEV to produce a large grid of template Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) for galaxies of spectral types E and Sa through Sd - one accounting in a chemically consistent way for the increasing initial metallicities of successive stellar generations, the other one for exclusively solar metallicities - for comparison.   We use our new photometric redshift code GAZELLE based on the comparison of observed and model SEDs. Comparing the photometric redshifts obtained using solar metallicity templates when working on a catalogue of artificially created chemically consistent SEDs, typical for low-metallicity local late-type galaxies and for intrinsically low-luminosity, and hence low-metallicity, galaxies in the high-redshift universe, we find a significant bias resulting from this metallicity mismatch. This bias consists in a systematic underestimate of the photometric redshift by typically Delta z ~ 0.1 ... 0.2 until z ~ 1.2, depending on galaxy type, of distant, faint and low-metallicity galaxies if analysed with solar-metallicity templates.",08,[],1

For the former we measure an absolute parallax of 13.37/-0.51 mas yielding Mv=15.25/-0.09. The astrometry for LSR1610-00 shows that this object is an astrometric binary with a period of 1.66/-0.01 yr. The photocentric orbit is derived from the data; it has a moderate eccentricity (e ~ 0.44/-0.02) and a semi-major axis of 0.28/-0.01 AU based on our measured absolute parallax of 31.02/-0.26 mas. Our radial velocity measure of -108.1/-1.6 km/s for LSR1610-00 at epoch 2006.179, when coupled with the observation of -95/-1 km/s at epoch 2005.167 by Reiners & Basri, indicates a systemic radial velocity of -101/-1 km/s for the LSR1610-00AB pair. The galactic velocity components for LSR142571 and LSR1610-00AB -- (U,V,W)=(84/-6, -202/-13, 66/-14) km/s and (U,V,W)=(36/-2, -232/-2, -61/-2) km/s, respectively. For both stars, the velocities are characteristic of halo population kinematics. However, modeling shows that both stars have orbits around the galaxy with high eccentricity that pass remarkably close to the galactic center. LSR142571 has a luminosity and colors consistent with its metal-poor subdwarf spectral classification, while LSR1610-00 has a luminosity and most colors indicative of being only mildly metal-poor, plus a uniquely red B-V color. The companion to LSR1610-00 must be a low-mass, substellar brown dwarf. We speculate on the paradoxical nature of LSR1610-00 and possible sources of its peculiarities.",08,[],1

An analysis of the spatial distribution and line-of-sight velocities of the maser spots allows us to identify typical patterns of a rotating and expanding ring in the position-velocity diagrams, according to our kinematical model. We find that the distribution of the masers is compatible with tracing a circular ring with a ~0.021 arcsec (~100 AU) radius, observed with an inclination angle with respect to the line of sight of 55 degrees. We derive expansion and rotation velocities of 1.4 and 3.1 km/s, respectively. The orientation of the ring projected on the plane of the sky, at PA 158 degrees, is almost orthogonal to the direction of the innermost region of the jet observed in K3-35, suggesting the presence of a disc or torus that may be related to the collimation of the outflow.",08,[],1

In particular we compute the effects of dissipation of primordial magnetic fields owing to ambipolar diffusion and decaying turbulence in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the collapsing halos and compute the effects of the altered thermal and ionization history on the formation of molecular hydrogen. We show that, for magnetic field strengths in the range equation, the molecular hydrogen fraction in IGM and collapsing halo can increase by a factor 5 to 1000 over the case with no magnetic fields. We discuss the implication of the increased molecular hydrogen fraction on the radiative transfer of UV photons and the formation of first structures in the universe.",08,[],1

The SOLARC instrument installed on Mt. Haleakala is such a polarimetric coronagraph that was designed for routinely observing Stokes parameter profiles in near infrared (NIR) wavelengthes. The Feequation 1075 nm forbidden coronal emission line (CEL) is potential for weak coronal magnetic field detection. As a first step the potential field model has been used to compare with the SOLARC observation in the Feequation 1075 nm line (Liu and Lin 2008). It's found that the potential fields can be a zeroth-order proxy for approaching the observed coronal field above a simple stable sunspot. In this paper we further discuss several nodi that are hampering the progress for reconstructing the real coronal magnetic field structures. They include the well-known Van Vleck effect in linear polarization signals, ignorance of the information of the NIR emission sources (i.e., inversion problem of coronal magnetic fields), a fat lot of global non-linear force-free field tools available for better modeling coronal magnetic fields, and so on.",08,[],1
0808.0961,astro-ph,"Using direct simulations of hydromagnetic turbulence driven by random polarized waves it is shown that dynamo action is possible over a wide range of magnetic Prandtl numbers from 10-3 to 1. Triply periodic boundary conditions are being used. In the final saturated state the resulting magnetic field has a large-scale component of Beltrami type. For the kinematic phase, growth rates have been determined for magnetic Prandtl numbers between 0.01 and 1, but only the case with the smallest magnetic Prandtl number shows large-scale magnetic fields. It is less organized than in the nonlinear stage. For small magnetic Prandtl numbers the growth rates are comparable to those calculated from an alpha squared mean-field dynamo. In the linear regime the magnetic helicity spectrum has a short inertial range compatible with a -5/3 power law, while in the nonlinear regime it is the current helicity whose spectrum may be compatible with such a law. In the saturated case, the spectral magnetic energy in the inertial range is in slight excess over the spectral kinetic energy, although for small magnetic Prandtl numbers the magnetic energy spectrum reaches its resistive cut off wavenumber more quickly. The viscous energy dissipation declines with the square root of the magnetic Prandtl number, which implies that most of the energy is dissipated via Joule heat.",08,[],1
0809.4805,astro-ph,"(Abridged) XTE J1810-197 and 1E 1547.0-5408 are two transient AXPs exhibiting radio emission with unusual properties. In addition, their spin down rates during outburst show opposite trends, which so far has no explanation. Here, we extend our quark-nova model for AXPs to include transient AXPs, in which the outbursts are caused by transient accretion events from a Keplerian (iron-rich) degenerate ring. For a ring with inner and outer radii of 23.5 km and 26.5 km, respectively, our model gives a good fit to the observed X-ray outburst from XTE J1810-197 and the behavior of temperature, luminosity, and area of the two X-ray blackbodies with time. The two blackbodies in our model are related to a heat front (i.e. Bohm diffusion front) propagating along the ring's surface and an accretion hot spot on the quark star surface. Radio pulsations in our model are caused by dissipation at the light cylinder of magnetic bubbles, produced near the ring during the X-ray outburst. The delay between X-ray peak emission and radio emission in our model is related to the propagation time of these bubbles to the light cylinder. We predict a ~1 year and ~1 month delay for XTE J1810-197 and 1E 1547.0-5408, respectively. The observed flat spectrum, erratic pulse profile, and the pulse duration are all explained in our model as a result of X-point reconnection events induced by the dissipation of the bubbles at the light cylinder. The spin down rate of the central quark star can either increase or decrease depending on how the radial drift velocity of the magnetic islands changes with distance from the central star. We suggest an evolutionary connection between transient AXPs and typical AXPs in our model.",08,[],1

We describe an algorithm for construction of appropriate star cluster models. Their stability over several crossing-times is verified by following the evolution by means of direct N-body integration.,08,[],1

The seismic mode parameters are the input data needed for making inference on stars and their internal structures. In this paper we discuss the ease with which it will be possible to extract estimates of individual mode parameters, dependent on the mass, age, and visual brightness of the star. Our results are generally applicable; however, we look at mode detectability in the context of the upcoming Kepler observations. To inform our discussions we make predictions of various seismic parameters. To do this we use simple empirical scaling relations and detailed pulsation computations of the stochastic excitation and damping characteristics of the Sun-like p modes. The issues related to parameter extraction on individual p modes discussed here are mode detectability, the detectability and impact of stellar activity cycles, and the ability to measure properties of rotationally split components, which is dependent on the relative importance of the rotational characteristics of the star and the damping of the stochastically excited p modes.",08,[],1

0811.4425,astro-ph,"The low redshift Universe (z<~0.5) is not a dull place. Processes leading to the suppression of star formation and morphological transformation are prevalent: this is particularly evident in the dramatic upturn in the fraction of S0-type galaxies in clusters. However, until now, the process and environment of formation has remained unidentified. We present a HST-based morphological analysis of galaxies in the redshift-space selected group and field environments at z~0.4. Groups contain a much higher fraction of S0s at fixed luminosity than the lower density field, with >99.999% confidence. Indeed the S0 fraction in groups is at least as high as in z~0.4 clusters and X-ray selected groups, which have more luminous Intra Group Medium (IGM). An 97% confident excess of S0s at >=0.3Mpc from the group centre at fixed luminosity, tells us that formation is not restricted to, and possibly even avoids, the group cores. Interactions with a bright X-ray emitting IGM cannot be important for the formation of the majority of S0s in the Universe. In contrast to S0s, the fraction of elliptical galaxies in groups at fixed luminosity is similar to the field, whilst the brightest ellipticals are strongly enhanced towards the group centres (>99.999% confidence within 0.3Mpc). We conclude that the group and sub-group environments must be dominant for the formation of S0 galaxies, and that minor mergers, galaxy harassment and tidal interactions are the most likely responsible mechanisms. This has implications not only for the inferred pre-processing of cluster galaxies, but also for the global morphological and star formation budget of galaxies: as hierarchical clustering progresses, more galaxies will be subject to these transformations as they enter the group environment.",08,[],1

Both the dust layers have their local magnetic field orientation nearly parallel to the direction of the Galactic plane.

0805.1103,astro-ph,"A significant fraction of microlensing planets have been discovered in high-magnification events, and a significant fraction of these events exhibit a double-peak structure at their peak. However, very wide or very close binaries can also produce double-peaked high-magnification events, with the same gross properties as those produced by planets. Traditionally, distinguishing between these two interpretations has relied upon detailed modeling, which is both time-consuming and generally does not provide insight into the observable properties that allow discrimination between these two classes of models. We study the morphologies of these two classes of double-peaked high-magnification events, and identify a simple diagnostic that can be used to immediately distinguish between perturbations caused by planetary and binary companions, without detailed modeling. This diagnostic is based on the difference in the shape of the intra-peak region of the light curves. The shape is smooth and concave for binary lensing, while it tends to be either boxy or convex for planetary lensing. In planetary lensing this intra-peak morphology is due to the small, weak cusp of the planetary central caustic located between the two stronger cusps. We apply this diagnostic to five observed double-peaked high-magnification events to infer their underlying nature. A corollary of our study is that good coverage of the intra-peak region of double-peaked high-magnification events is likely to be important for their unique interpretation.",08,[],1
0801.1008,astro-ph,"The Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM) is thought to contribute about 40-50 % to the baryonic budget at the present evolution stage of the universe. The observed large scale structure is likely to be due to gravitational growth of density fluctuations in the post-inflation era. The evolving cosmic web is governed by non-linear gravitational growth of the initially weak density fluctuations in the dark energy dominated cosmology. Non-linear structure formation, accretion and merging processes, star forming and AGN activity produce gas shocks in the WHIM. Shock waves are converting a fraction of the gravitation power to thermal and non-thermal emission of baryonic/leptonic matter. They provide the most likely way to power the luminous matter in the WHIM. The plasma shocks in the WHIM are expected to be collisionless. Collisionless shocks produce a highly non-equilibrium state with anisotropic temperatures and a large differences in ion and electron temperatures. We discuss the ion and electron heating by the collisionless shocks and then review the plasma processes responsible for the Coulomb equilibration and collisional ionisation equilibrium of oxygen ions in the WHIM. MHD-turbulence produced by the strong collisionless shocks could provide a sizeable non-thermal contribution to the observed Doppler parameter of the UV line spectra of the WHIM.",08,[],1

This instrument recorded 65 seconds of usable data between 43-49.5 \AA in two prominent features. The first feature near 45 \AA is dominated by the He-like triplet of \ionO7 in second order with contributions from \ionMg10 and \ionSi9-\ionSi12 in first order, while the second feature near 47.5 \AA is first order \ionS9 and \ionS10. Fits to the spectra give an equilibrium plasma at equation (equation keV) and near cosmic abundances.

We analyse the distribution of the degree of polarization to show that the large depolarization asymmetry between the North and South sides of the source seen in earlier work largely disappears as the resolution is increased. We show that the depolarization seen at low resolution results primarily from unresolved gradients in a Faraday screen in front of the synchrotron-emitting plasma. We establish that the residual degree of polarization in the short-wavelength limit should follow a Burn law and we fit such a law to our data to estimate the residual depolarization at high resolution. We show that the observed RM variations over selected areas of 3C 31 are consistent with a power spectrum of magnetic fluctuations in front of 3C 31 whose power-law slope changes significantly on the scales sampled by our data. The power spectrum can only have the form expected for Kolmogorov turbulence on scales <5 kpc. On larger scales we find a flatter slope. We also compare the global variations of RM across 3C 31 with the results of three-dimensional simulations of the magnetic-field fluctuations in the surrounding magnetoionic medium. We show that our data are consistent with a field distribution that favours the plane perpendicular to the jet axis - probably because the radio source has evacuated a large cavity in the surrounding medium.

Three different spectral states have been identified from the hard Color-Intensity diagram derived from INTEGRAL: the canonical Hard and Soft as well as an Intermediate state. The hard state spectrum is well described by a weak black body component plus a Comptonised plasma component with high electron temperature (kTe~60 keV) extending up to 200 keV without any additional cut-off. The soft spectra are characterized by a cold Comptonised plasma (kTe= 2-3 keV, and 7 keV for the intermediate state) and a strong disk black body component. A reflection component, indicating reflection of the X-ray radiation from the accretion disc, is also present in the soft state revealed by BeppoSAX in 1998.

Contrary to the well-known transiting planet HD209458b, we find that the atmosphere of HD17156b is unlikely to escape hydrodynamically at any point along the orbit, even if the upper atmosphere is almost entirely composed of atomic hydrogen and H, and infrared cooling by H3 ions is negligible. The nature of the upper atmosphere is sensitive to to the composition of the thermosphere, and in particular to the mixing ratio of H2, as the availability of H2 regulates radiative cooling.

0809.2826,astro-ph,"A brief overview of the r-process is given with an emphasis on the observational implications for this process. The conditions required for the major production of the heavy r-process elements (r-elements) with mass numbers A >130 are discussed based on a generic astrophysical model where matter adiabatically expands from a hot and dense initial state. Nucleosynthesis in the neutrino-driven winds from nascent neutron stars is discussed as a specific example. Such winds readily produce the elements from Sr to Ag with A ~ 88 to 110 through charged-particle reactions in the alpha-process but appear incapable of making the heavy r-elements. Observations of elemental abundances in metal-poor stars have provided many valuable insights into the r-process. They have demonstrated that the production of the heavy r-elements must be associated with massive stars evolving on short timescales, provided evidence strongly favoring core-collapse supernovae over neutron star mergers as the major source for these elements, and shown that this source cannot produce any significant amount of the low-A elements from Na to Ge including Fe. A self-consistent astrophysical model of the r-process remains to be developed, and it appears well worthwhile to carry out more comprehensive studies on the evolution and explosion of the massive stars of ~ 8 to 11 Msun that undergo O-Ne-Mg core collapse and produce a very insignificant amount of the low-A elements.",08,[],1

The underlying hypothesis is that GRB subpulses are photons that are scattered into our line of sight by local concentrations of baryons that are accelerated by radiation pressure. For primary spectra that are power laws with exponential cutoffs, the width of the pulse and its fast rise, slow decay asymmetry is found to increase with decreasing photon energy, and the width near the exponential cutoff scales approximately as equation, with equation, as observed. The spectral lag time is naturally inversely proportional to luminosity, all else being equal, also as observed.",08,[],1
0801.0645,astro-ph,"Observations from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph define the flux of the DBQ4 star LDS749B from 0.12-1.0 letter m with an uncertainty of ~1% relative to the three pure hydrogen WD primary HST standards.

Upper limit to the atmospheric hydrogen and oxygen fractions by number are 1x10-7 and 7x10-10, respectively. The excellent agreement of the model flux distribution with the observations lends confidence to the accuracy of the modeled IR fluxes beyond the limits of the STIS spectrophotometry.

0812.1255,astro-ph,"Array-based, direct-sampling radio telescopes have computational and communication requirements unsuited to conventional computer and cluster architectures. Synchronization must be strictly maintained across a large number of parallel data streams, from A/D conversion, through operations such as beamforming, to dataset recording. FPGAs supporting multi-gigabit serial I/O are ideally suited to this application. We describe a recently-constructed radio telescope called ETA having all-sky observing capability for detecting low frequency pulses from transient events such as gamma ray bursts and primordial black hole explosions. Signals from 24 dipole antennas are processed by a tiered arrangement of 28 commercial FPGA boards and 4 PCs with FPGA-based data acquisition cards, connected with custom I/O adapter boards supporting InfiniBand and LVDS physical links.

0812.2187,astro-ph,"The fate of massive cold clumps, their internal structure and collapse need to be characterised to understand the initial conditions for the formation of high-mass stars, stellar systems, and the origin of associations and clusters. We explore the onset of star formation in the 75 Msun SMM1 clump in the region ISOSS J18364-0221 using infrared and (sub-)millimetre observations including interferometry. This contracting clump has fragmented into two compact cores SMM1 North and South of 0.05 pc radius, having masses of 15 and 10 Msun, and luminosities of 20 and 180 Lsun. SMM1 South harbours a source traced at 24 and 70um, drives an energetic molecular outflow, and appears supersonically turbulent at the core centre. SMM1 North has no infrared counterparts and shows lower levels of turbulence, but also drives an outflow. Both outflows appear collimated and parsec-scale near-infrared features probably trace the outflow-powering jets. We derived mass outflow rates of at least 4E-5 Msun/yr and outflow timescales of less than 1E4 yr. Our HCN(1-0) modelling for SMM1 South yielded an infall velocity of 0.14 km/s and an estimated mass infall rate of 3E-5 Msun/yr. Both cores may harbour seeds of intermediate- or high-mass stars. We compare the derived core properties with recent simulations of massive core collapse. They are consistent with the very early stages dominated by accretion luminosity.",08,[],1
0810.0489,astro-ph,"We observed the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 with Gemini-South in g' and i' bands, nearly simultaneous with XMM-Newton observations. A clear periodic flux modulation on the system's orbital period is present, consistent with the varying aspect of the donor star's heated face. We model the contributions of a disk and donor star to these optical bands. To produce the observed modulation amplitudes, we conclude that the donor must be irradiated by an external flux 2 orders of magnitude greater than provided by the measured X-ray luminosity. A possible explanation for this irradiation is that the radio pulsar mechanism becomes active during the quiescent state as suggested by Burderi et al., with relativistic particles heating the donor's day-side face. Our modelling constrains the binary inclination to be between 36 and 67 degrees. We obtain estimates for the pulsar mass of >2.2 solar masses (although this limit is sensitive to the source's distance), consistent with the accelerated NS cooling in this system indicated by X-ray observations. We also estimate the donor mass to be in the range of 0.07-0.11 solar masses, providing further indications that the system underwent non-standard binary evolution to reach its current state.",08,[],1
0807.1733,astro-ph,"The nonlinear perturbation theory of gravitational instability is extended to include effects of both biasing and redshift-space distortions, which are inevitable in predicting observable quantities in galaxy surveys. The precise determination of scales of baryon acoustic oscillations is crucial to investigate the nature of dark energy by galaxy surveys. We find that a local Lagrangian bias and redshift-space distortions are naturally incorporated in our formalism of perturbation theory with a resummation technique via the Lagrangian picture. Our formalism is applicable to any biasing scheme which is local in Lagrangian space, including the halo bias as a special case. Weakly nonlinear effects on halo clustering in redshift space are analytically given.We assume only a fundamental idea of the halo model: haloes form according to the extended Press-Schechter theory, and the spatial distributions are locally biased in Lagrangian space. There is no need for assuming the spherical collapse model to follow the dynamical evolution, which is additionally assumed in standard halo prescriptions. One-loop corrections to the power spectrum and correlation function of haloes in redshift space are explicitly derived and presented. Instead of relying on expensive numerical simulations, our approach provides an analytic way of investigating the weakly nonlinear effects, simultaneously including the nonlinear biasing and nonlinear redshift-space distortions. Nonlinearity introduces a weak scale dependence in the halo bias. The scale dependence is a smooth function in Fourier space, and the bias does not critically change the feature of baryon acoustic oscillations in the power spectrum. The same feature in the correlation function is less affected by nonlinear effects of biasing.",08,[],1
0804.2892,astro-ph,"A comparison between published field galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) shows that the cosmic stellar mass density is in the range 4--8 per cent of the baryon density (assuming Omegab = 0.045). There remain significant sources of uncertainty for the dust correction and underlying stellar mass-to-light ratio even assuming a reasonable universal stellar initial mass function. We determine the z < 0.05 GSMF using the New York University - Value-Added Galaxy Catalog sample of 49968 galaxies derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and various estimates of stellar mass. The GSMF shows clear evidence for a low-mass upturn and is fitted with a double Schechter function that has alpha2 =~ -1.6. At masses below ~ 108.5 Msun, the GSMF may be significantly incomplete because of missing low surface-brightness galaxies. One interpretation of the stellar mass-metallicity relation is that it is primarily caused by a lower fraction of available baryons converted to stars in low-mass galaxies. Using this principal, we determine a simple relationship between baryonic mass and stellar mass and present an `implied baryonic mass function'. This function has a faint-end slope, alpha2 =~ -1.9. Thus, we find evidence that the slope of the low-mass end of the galaxy mass function could plausibly be as steep as the halo mass function. We illustrate the relationship between halo baryonic mass function to galaxy baryonic mass function to GSMF. This demonstrates the requirement for peak galaxy formation efficiency at baryonic masses ~ 1011 Msun corresponding to a minimum in feedback effects. The baryonic-infall efficiency may have levelled off at lower masses.",08,[],1

The variety of radiation morphologies in the burst tails and the persistent stages could be well explained by the trapped fireballs on different sites inside the closed field lines.

Firstly, the information cost required to operate a Maxwell's demon on a curved spacetime is estimated using the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. More importantly, the charge and time (C and T) reversal properties of the Kerr-Newman solution in General relativity show that this solution, similarly to the Dirac equation, appears to represent both a particle and its antiparticle and suggests a definition of antimatter in general relativity.

0804.1909,astro-ph,"Aims. We measure, as far out as possible, radial temperature profiles for a sample of ~50 hot, intermediate redshift galaxy clusters, selected from the XMM-Newton archive, keeping systematic errors under control.   Methods. Our work is characterized by two major improvements. Firstly, we use the background modeling, rather than the background subtraction, and the Cash statistic rather than the chi square; this method requires a careful characterization of all background components. Secondly, we assess in details systematic effects. We perform two groups of test: prior to the analysis, we make use of extensive simulations to quantify the impact of different spectral components on simulated spectra; after the analysis, we investigate how the measured temperature profile changes, when choosing different key parameters.   Results. The mean temperature profile declines beyond 0.2 R180; for the first time we provide an assessment of the source and the magnitude of systematic uncertainties. When comparing our profile with that obtained from hydrodynamic simulations, we find the slopes beyond ~0.2 R180 to be similar. Our mean profile is similar but somewhat flatter with respect to that obtained by previous observational works, possibly as a consequence of a different level of characterization of systematic effects.   Conclusions. This work allows us not only to constrain with confidence cluster temperature profiles in outer regions, but also, from a more general point of view, to explore the limits of the current X-ray experiments (in particular XMM-Newton) with respect to the analysis of low surface brightness emission.",08,[],1
0803.1826,astro-ph,"We present results from K band slit scan observations of a ~20'x20' region of the Galactic center (GC) in two separate epochs more than five years apart. The high resolution (R>=14,000) observations allow the most accurate radial velocity and acceleration measurements of the stars in the central parsec of the Galaxy. Detected stars can be divided into three groups based on the CO absorption band heads at ~2.2935 microns and the He I lines at ~2.0581 microns and ~2.112, 2.113 microns: cool, narrow-line hot and broad-line hot. The radial velocities of the cool, late-type stars have approximately a symmetrical distribution with its center at ~-7.8(/-10.3) km/s and a standard deviation ~113.7(/-10.3) km/s. Although our statistics are dominated by the brightest stars, we estimate a central black hole mass of 3.9(/-1.1) million solar masses, consistent with current estimates from complete orbits of individual stars. Our surface density profile and the velocity dispersion of the late type stars support the existence of a low density region at the Galactic center suggested by earlier observations. Many hot, early-type stars show radial velocity changes higher than maximum values allowed by pure circular orbital motions around a central massive object, suggesting that the motions of these stars greatly deviate from circular orbital motions around the Galactic center. The correlation between the radial velocities of the early type He I stars and their declination offsets from Sagittarius A* suggests that a systematic rotation is present for the early-type population. No figure rotation around the Galactic center for the late type stars is supported by the new observations.",08,[],1
0809.4444,astro-ph,"Dynamical properties of two-component galaxy models whose stellar density distribution is described by a gamma-model while the total density distribution has a pure r(-2) profile, are presented. The orbital structure of the stellar component is described by Osipkov-Merritt anisotropy, while the dark matter halo is isotropic. After a description of minimum halo models, the positivity of the phase-space density (the model consistency) is investigated, and necessary and sufficient conditions for consistency are obtained analytically as a function of the stellar inner density slope gamma and anisotropy radius. The explicit phase-space distribution function is recovered for integer values of gamma, and it is shown that while models with gamma>4/17 are consistent when the anisotropy radius is larger than a critical value (dependent on gamma), the gamma=0 models are unphysical even in the fully isotropic case. The Jeans equations for the stellar component are then solved analytically; in addition, the projected velocity dispersion at the center and at large radii are also obtained analytically for generic values of the anisotropy radius, and it is found that they are given by remarkably simple expressions. The presented models, even though highly idealized, can be useful as starting point for more advanced modeling of the mass distribution of elliptical galaxies in studies combining stellar dynamics and gravitational lensing.",08,[],1

0810.0094,astro-ph,"We calculate the flux of non-thermal radiations from the supernova remnant RX J1713.7-3946 in the context of the non-linear theory of particle acceleration at shocks, which allows us to take into account self-consistently the dynamical reaction of the accelerated particles, the generation of magnetic fields in the shock proximity and the dynamical reaction of the magnetic field on the plasma. When the fraction of particles which get accelerated is of order equation, we find that the strength of the magnetic field obtained as a result of streaming instability induced by cosmic rays is compatible with the interpretation of the X-ray emitting filaments being produced by strong synchrotron losses in equation magnetic fields. If the X-ray filaments are explained in alternative ways, the constraint on the magnetic field downstream of the shock disappears and the HESS data can be marginally fit with ICS of relativistic electrons off a complex population of photons, tailored to comprise CMB and ambient IR/Optical photons. The fit, typically poor at the highest energies, requires a large density of target photons within the remnant; only a fraction of order equation of the background particles gets accelerated; the local magnetic field is of order equation and the maximum energy of protons is much lower than the knee energy. Current HESS gamma ray observations combined with recent X-ray observations by Suzaku do not allow as yet to draw a definitive conclusion on whether RX J1713.7-3946 is an efficient cosmic ray accelerator, although at the present time a hadronic interpretation of HESS data seems more likely.

0811.1488,astro-ph,"We consider the problem of determining the structure of the dark halo of nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) from the spherical Jeans equations. Whether the dark halos are cusped or cored at the centre is an important strategic problem in modern astronomy. The observational data comprise the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of a luminous tracer population. We show that when such data are analysed to find the dark matter density with the spherical Poisson and Jeans equations, then the generic solution is a dark halo density that is cusped like an isothermal. Although milder cusps (like the Navarro-Frenk-White 1/r cusp and even cores are possible, they are not generic. Such solutions exist only if the anisotropy parameter beta and the logarithmic slope of the stellar density gamma satisfy the constraint gamma = 2 x beta at the centre or if the radial velocity dispersion falls to zero at the centre. This surprisingly strong statement is really a consequence of the assumption of spherical symmetry, and the consequent coordinate singularity at the origin. So, for example, a dSph with an exponential light profile can exist in Navarro-Frenk- White halo and have a flat velocity dispersion, but anisotropy in general drives the dark halo solution to an isothermal cusp. The identified cusp or core is therefore a consequence of the assumptions (particularly of spherical symmetry and isotropy), and not the data.",08,[],1

The catalog detections can be classified into three categories: (a) detections of high reliability with S/N > 6.5; (b) high velocity clouds in the Milky Way or its periphery; and (c) signals of lower S/N which coincide spatially with an optical object and known redshift. 75% of the sources are newly published HI detections.

It often happens that the finite frequency response of the photon absorption or the tunneling density of states exhibits a singular behavior as a function of frequency: equation where equation is a threshold frequency and equation is an exponent characterizing the singular response. In this paper singular responses of spin-incoherent Luttinger liquids are reviewed. Such responses most often do not fall into the familiar form above, but instead typically exhibit logarithmic corrections and display a much higher universality in terms of the microscopic interactions in the theory.

Both analytical and molecular-dynamics approaches are used. We construct a phase diagram of the system in the plane of regular and random pinning strengths and determine typical vortex lattice defects appearing in the system due to the disorder. We find that the total disordering of the vortex lattice can occur either in one step or in two steps. For instance, in the limit of weak pinning, a square lattice of pinned vortices is destroyed in two steps. First, elastic chains of depinned vortices appear in the film; but the vortex lattice as a whole remains still pinned by the underlying square array of regular pinning sites.

In contrast to intermediate valence models where the hybridization with delocalized conduction band electrons is known to suppress magnetic ordering temperatures to at most a few Kelvin, covalent hybridization to the localized P2 orbitals avoids this suppression.

0810.5268,cond-mat,"Using a 3-D parallelepiped model of intrinsic Josephson junctions, we calculate the cavity resonance modes of Josephson plasma waves excited by external electric currents. The electromagnetic (EM) wave of the excited Josephson plasma is converted to a THz EM wave at the sample surfaces. The cavity modes accompanied by static phase kinks of the superconducting order parameter have been intensively investigated. The phase kinks induce a spatial modulation of the amplitude of the order parameter around the kinks and decrease the superconducting condensation energy. The Josephson plasma produces a magnetic field in the vacuum in addition to the emitted EM wave. This magnetic energy detemines the orientation of the cavity mode. Taking account of the facts mentioned above, we obtained sharp resonance peaks in the I-V curves and sizable powers of continuous and coherent terahertz wave emission at the cavity resonance. The emission frequencies are inversely proportional to the length of the shorter side of the samples in agreement with experiments.",08,[],8
0803.1037,cond-mat,"High degree of preservation of spin states during energy relaxation processes mediated by optical phonons is demonstrated in a single quantum dot. Optical-phonon resonance and relevant suppression of spin relaxation are clearly identified as dip structures in photoluminescence excitation spectra probed by the positive trion emission. The absence of continuum states makes this observation possible under the cross-circularly polarized detection with respect to a circularly polarized pumping. Consequently, distinguishably high degree of circular polarization up to ~0.85 is achieved without applying external magnetic field at the optical-phonon resonance. Rate equation analysis reveals that the spin-flip probability during energy relaxation is restricted to less than 7.5%. It is also indicated that the spin flip time of the positive trion ground state is extended by more than 3 times compared with that of neutral exciton ground state. This corresponds to the spin flip time longer than 11 ns for the positive trion ground state. The influence of nuclear polarization to the present measurements is also discussed.",08,[],8

In an attempt to solve the well-known CO adsorption puzzle we have applied the relatively new vdW-DF theory of nonlocal correlation. The application of the vdW-DF functional in all considered cases improves or completely solves the discrepancies of the adsorption site preference and improves the value of the adsorption energy. By introducing a cutoff distance for nonlocal interaction we pinpoint the length scale at which the correlation plays a major role in the systems considered.,08,[],8

Hereby we make use of a real-time diagrammatic technique in the adiabatic limit that takes into account strong Coulomb interaction in the dot. We analyze the degree of spin polarization of electrons pumped from a ferromagnet through the dot to a nonmagnetic lead (N-dot-F) as well as the dependence of the pumped charge on the relative leads' magnetization orientations for a spin-valve (F-dot-F) structure. For the former case, we find that, depending on the relative coupling strength to the leads, spin and charge can, on average, be pumped in opposite directions. For the latter case, we find an angular dependence of the pumped charge, that becomes more and more anharmonic for large spin polarization in the leads.",08,[],8

We derive analytical expressions for the mean length of the basic structural units of adsorbed polymer, such as loops and tails, in terms of the adhesive potential and detachment force, and determine values of the universal exponents which govern their probability distributions. Most notably, the hitherto controversial value of the critical adsorption exponent equation is found to depend essentially on the interaction between different loops. The chain detachment transition turns out to be of the first order, albeit dichotomic, i.e., no coexistence of different phase states exists. These novel theoretical predictions and the suggested phase diagram of the adsorption-desorption transformation under external pulling force are verified by means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations.",08,[],8

The quantum origin of this anomaly is the collapsing or bundling of field lines of Berry curvature caused by the interaction between bosons in the semiclassical limit. The significance of this anomalous monopole is twofold: (1) it signals the failure of the von Neumann-Wigner theorem in the semiclassical limit; (2) it indicates a breakdown of the correspondence principle between quantum and classical dynamics.,08,[],8
0810.4139,cond-mat,"Complex fluids exhibit structure on a wide range of length and time scales, and hierarchical approaches are necessary to investigate all facets of their often unusual properties. The study of idealized coarse-grained models at different levels of coarse-graining can provide insight into generic structures and basic dynamical processes at equilibrium and non-equilibrium.   In the first part of this lecture, some popular coarse-grained models for membranes and membrane systems are reviewed. Special focus is given to bead-spring models with different solvent representations, and to random-interface models. Selected examples of simulations at the molecular and the mesoscopic level are presented, and it is shown how simulations of molecular coarse-grained models can bridge between different levels.   The second part addresses simulation methods for complex fluids under shear. After a brief introduction into the phenomenology (in particular for liquid crystals), different non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) methods are introduced and compared to one another. Application examples include the behavior of liquid crystal interfaces and lamellar surfactant phases under shear. Finally, mesoscopic simulation approaches for liquid crystals under shear are briefly discussed.",08,[],8

We realize this novel potential shape with a superconducting circuit comprised of a loop interrupted by two Josephson junctions, with near-zero current bias and flux bias near half a flux quantum. We investigate escape out of the central well, which can occur via tunneling through either of the two barriers, and find good agreement with a generalized double-path macroscopic quantum tunneling theory.

0804.1480,cond-mat,"Effect of the femtosecond and nanosecond UV laser irradiation (below the ablation threshold) of graphite-like hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been studied. Experiments were carried out with the compacted powder under high vacuum at room temperature using excimer KrF laser (248 nm). In the nanosecond operation mode, the laser-induced fluorescence spectra are found strongly modified depending on the integrated doze, which is attributed to a progressive enrichment of the surface layer by elemental boron. A slow sample recovery after the laser irradiation has been observed. On the other hand, in the femtosecond mode the fluorescence spectra depend on the laser fluence, and the changes are reversible: low energy fluorescence spectra are restored immediately when the laser energy decreases. This effect can be explained by a material bleaching, which favors a bulk centers emission. The ablation threshold has been determined as 78 mJ/cm2 in the femtosecond laser operational mode.",08,[],8

We explicitly demonstrate the evolution from ""Fermi arcs"" (on the ""large"" Fermi surface) observed in ARPES experiments at relatively high temperatures (when both the amplitude and phase of density waves fluctuate randomly) towards formation of typical ""small"" electron and hole ""pockets"", which are apparently observed in de Haas - van Alfen and Hall resistance oscillation experiments at low temperatures (when only the phase of density waves fluctuate, and correlation length of the short-range order is large enough).

0812.2612,cond-mat,"We use an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer to explore the non-equilibrium coherence of the electron waves within the edge-states that form in the integral quantum Hall effect. The visibility of the interference as a function of bias-voltage and transmission probabilities of the mirrors, which are realized by quantum point-contacts, reveal an unexpected asymmetry at finite bias when the transmission probability equation of the mirror at the input of the interferometer is varied between 0 and 100%, while the transmission probability of the other mirror at the output is kept fixed. This can lead to the surprising result of an increasing magnitude of interference with increasing bias-voltage for certain values of equation. A detailed analysis for various transmission probabilities and different directions of the magnetic field demonstrates that this effect is not related to the transmission characteristics of a single quantum point contact, but is an inherent property of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer with edge-states.",08,[],8

Moreover, the radiative lifetimes also depend heavily on the composition of the direct surrounding of the QDs. A broad lifetime distribution occurs even for moderate variations of the QD structure.

Results of our investigations show that the spin orbit interaction induces dramatic qualitative changes in the evolution of spin polarized wave packet. The initial wave packet splits into two parts with different spin polarization propagating with unequal group velocity. This splitting appears due to the presence of two branches of electron spectrum corresponding to the stationary states with different chirality. It is demonstrated also that in the presence of external magnetic field B$ perpendicular to the electron gas plane the wave packet splits into two parts which rotates with different cyclotron frequencies. It was shown that after some periods the electron density distributes around cyclotron orbit and the motion acquire an irregular character.

We show, by coupling mean field theory of diluted magnetic semiconductor ferromagnetism with master equations governing the Mn spin-dynamics, that a mere splitting of the up-spin and down-spin quasi-Fermi levels by 0.1 meV will produce the effect of an external magnetic field as large as 1 T as long as the alternative relaxation paths for Mn spins (i.e. spin-lattice relaxation) can be neglected. The physics is similar to the classic Overhauser effect, also called the dynamic nuclear polarization, with the Mn impurities playing the role of the nucleus.

0801.2335,cond-mat,"The Random-Field Ising Model (RFIM) has been extensively studied as a model system for understanding the effects of disorder in magnets. Since the late 1970s, there has been a particular focus on realizations of the RFIM in site-diluted antiferromagnets. We observe random-field effects in the dilute dipole-coupled ferromagnet equation. In the presence of a magnetic field transverse to the Ising axis (equation), the behavior of equation becomes increasingly dominated by the influence of random-field terms in the effective Hamiltonian. This is seen experimentally in the shape of the ferromagentic-paramagnetic phase boundary and in changes to the critical exponents near the classical critical point. We find that above the classical critical point the magnetic susceptibility diverges as equation, and that the susceptibility both above and below the classical critical point can be collapsed onto a single universal curve using a modified Curie law which explicitly incorporates random-field contributions. The discovery of a ferromagnetic realization of the RFIM opens the door to investigation of the random-field problem with the wide variety of techniques available for probing ferromagnets, including the ability to examine both the statics and dynamics of the random-field problem.

Since the underlying local f-exchange is preserved we expect only the f-d interactions to change across the phase transition and to cause the paramagnetic damping. The damping exhibits single-ion behavior independent of wave vector and vanishes below the hidden order transition. We suggest that this arises from a transition from valence fluctuations to a hybridized f-d state below Tequation. Here we present evidence that the itinerant excitations, like those in chromium, are due to Fermi surface nesting of hole and electron pockets so that the hidden order phase likely originates from a Fermi-surface instability.

The exponential model gives monotonically decreasing (with h) wetting chemical potential, while this dependence is monotonic only for the m=1 case of the algebraic model. Linear stability analysis of the planar equilibrium surface is performed. Simulations of the surface dynamics in the strongly nonlinear regime (large deviations from the planar equilibrium) and for large surface energy anisotropies demonstrate that for any m the film is less prone to dewetting when it is governed by the algebraic model.

For the equation phonon, the separation between the As and Fe planes induces a non-collinear arrangement of the Fe magnetic moments. This arrangement is anti parallel for interactions mediated by As, and perpendicular for Fe-Fe direct interactions, thus avoiding frustration. This coupling of magnetism with vibrations induces anharmonicities and an electron-phonon interaction much larger than in the pure paramagnetic case. We propose that such enhanced interactions play an essential role in superconducting compounds close to an atiferromagnetic phase transition.",08,[],8
0804.1847,cond-mat,"To describe the non-equilibrium dynamics of random systems, we have recently introduced (C. Monthus and T. Garel, arxiv:0802.2502) a 'strong disorder renormalization' (RG) procedure in configuration space that can be defined for any master equation. In the present paper, we analyze in details the properties of the large time dynamics whenever the RG flow is towards some ""infinite disorder"" fixed point, where the width of the renormalized barriers distribution grows indefinitely upon iteration. In particular, we show how the strong disorder RG rules can be then simplified while keeping their asymptotic exactness, because the preferred exit channel out of a given renormalized valley typically dominates asymptotically over the other exit channels. We explain why the present approach is an explicit construction in favor of the droplet scaling picture where the dynamics is governed by the logarithmic growth of the coherence length equation, and where the statistics of barriers corresponds to a very strong hierarchy of valleys within valleys. As an example of application, we have followed numerically the RG flow for the case of a directed polymer in a two-dimensional random medium. The full RG rules are used to check that the RG flow is towards some infinite disorder fixed point, whereas the simplified RG rules allow to study bigger sizes and to estimate the barrier exponent equation of the fixed point.",08,[],8
0803.3387,cond-mat,We study the electronic structure of graphene in the presence of either sevenfolds or eightfolds by using a gauge field-theory model. The graphene sheet with topological defects is considered as a negative cone surface with infinite Gaussian curvature at the center.

The density of states at the Fermi energy is found to be zero in all cases except two sevenfolds with translational factor equation.,08,[],8
0804.3555,cond-mat,"We consider the motion of an overdamped particle in a periodic potential lacking spatial symmetry under the influence of symmetric L\'evy noise, being a minimal setup for a 'L\'evy ratchet.' Due to the non-thermal character of the L\'evy noise, the particle exhibits a motion with a preferred direction even in the absence of whatever additional time-dependent forces. The examination of the L\'evy ratchet has to be based on the characteristics of directionality which are different from typically used measures like mean current and the dispersion of particles' positions, since these get inappropriate when the moments of the noise diverge. To overcome this problem, we discuss robust measures of directionality of transport like the position of the median of the particles displacements' distribution characterizing the group velocity, and the interquantile distance giving the measure of the distributions' width. Moreover, we analyze the behavior of splitting probabilities for leaving an interval of a given length unveiling qualitative differences between the noises with L\'evy indices below and above unity. Finally, we inspect the problem of the first escape from an interval of given length revealing independence of exit times on the structure of the potential.",08,[],8

It is shown that the number of contact points between the device electrodes and the molecule can play an important role in the electron conduction. The transmission is due to the resonant tunneling when the electrodes are contacted to one carbon atom of the molecule. In the case of multiple contacts, the interference effects are responsible for the change of the transmission through the Cequation.

0808.3759,cond-mat,"We investigate the strong curvature that appears at the boundaries of a thin crumpled elastic membrane. We account for these high-curvature regions in terms of the stretching-ridge singularity believed to dominate the structure of strongly deformed elastic membranes. Using a membrane fastened to itself to form a bag shape with a single stretching ridge, we show that the creation of points of high boundary curvature lowers the interior ridge's energy. In the limit of small thickness, the induced curvature becomes arbitrarily strong on the scale of the object size and results in sharp edges connecting interior vertices to the boundary. REVISED: We analyze these edges as conical sectors with no stretching. As the membrane size diverges, the edge energy grows as the square root of the central ridge energy. For comparison, we discuss the effect of truncating a stretching ridge at its ends. The effect of truncation becomes appreciable when the truncation length is comparable to the width of the untruncated ridge.",08,[],8

The modes are obtained by the semi-analytic method in the least square collocation scheme and confirmed by the finite element method simulations. Two resonance modes, corresponding to the vibration of the cylinder along the long and short axes, give rise to resonance reflections of elastic waves. One mode in between the two modes, related to the opposite vibration of the two cylinders in the unit cell in the direction along the layer, results in the total transmission of elastic waves due to zero effective mass density at the frequency. The resonance frequency of this new mode changes continuously with the orientation angle of the elliptic resonator.",08,[],8
0810.3869,cs,"In a two tier cellular network -- comprised of a central macrocell underlaid with shorter range femtocell hotspots -- cross-tier interference limits overall capacity with universal frequency reuse. To quantify near-far effects with universal frequency reuse, this paper derives a fundamental relation providing the largest feasible cellular Signal-to-Interference-Plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), given any set of feasible femtocell SINRs. We provide a link budget analysis which enables simple and accurate performance insights in a two-tier network. A distributed utility-based SINR adaptation at femtocells is proposed in order to alleviate cross-tier interference at the macrocell from cochannel femtocells. The Foschini-Miljanic (FM) algorithm is a special case of the adaptation. Each femtocell maximizes their individual utility consisting of a SINR based reward less an incurred cost (interference to the macrocell). Numerical results show greater than 30% improvement in mean femtocell SINRs relative to FM. In the event that cross-tier interference prevents a cellular user from obtaining its SINR target, an algorithm is proposed that reduces transmission powers of the strongest femtocell interferers. The algorithm ensures that a cellular user achieves its SINR target even with 100 femtocells/cell-site, and requires a worst case SINR reduction of only 16% at femtocells. These results motivate design of power control schemes requiring minimal network overhead in two-tier networks with shared spectrum.",08,[],7

We show that random instances of WEIGHTED equation-SAT can be solved in equation-time with high probability, indicating that typical instances of WEIGHTED equation-SAT under this instance distribution are fixed-parameter tractable.

A standard pumping lemma encounters difficulty in proving that a given language is not regular in the presence of advice.

Such analytical characterizations allow us to study power control for optimal transport throughput under constraints on the interference to primary users. Furthermore, we reveal the difference between detecting primary signals and detecting spectrum opportunities, and demonstrate the complex relationship between physical layer spectrum sensing and MAC layer throughput.

0810.4451,cs,"Most current mobile agent systems are based on programming languages whose semantics are difficult to prove correct as they lack an adequate underlying formal theory.

In this technical report we present the syntax and the semantics of a scripting language for programming mobile agents called Mob. We describe the language's syntax and semantics. Mob is service-oriented, meaning that agents act both as servers and as clients of services and that this coupling is done dynamically at run-time.

We answer the question affirmatively for extremely general corruption patterns: we only request that the topology of the network and the corruption pattern of the adversary leaves at least one path each round connecting the sender and receiver through honest nodes (though this path may change at every round). Out construction works in the public-key setting and enjoys bounded memory per processor (that does not depend on the amount of traffic and is polynomial in the network size.)

For this method, support, the co-occurrence frequency of the items which form an association, is used as the primary indicator of the associations's significance.

Support has some known problems with rare items, favors shorter itemsets and sometimes produces misleading associations.   In this paper we develop a novel model-based frequency constraint as an alternative to a single, user-specified minimum support. The constraint utilizes knowledge of the process generating transaction data by applying a simple stochastic mixture model (the NB model) which allows for transaction data's typically highly skewed item frequency distribution. A user-specified precision threshold is used together with the model to find local frequency thresholds for groups of itemsets. Based on the constraint we develop the notion of NB-frequent itemsets and adapt a mining algorithm to find all NB-frequent itemsets in a database.

Variants of these games - defined by the type of moves allowed for the players - have been found to be closely connected to graph decompositions and associated width measures such as path- or tree-width. Of particular interest is the question whether these games are monotone, i.e. whether the cops can catch a robber without ever allowing the robber to reach positions that have been cleared before. The monotonicity problem for graph searching games has intensely been studied in the literature, but for two types of games the problem was left unresolved. These are the games on digraphs where the robber is invisible and lazy or visible and fast. In this paper, we solve the problems by giving examples showing that both types of games are non-monotone. Graph searching games on digraphs are closely related to recent proposals for digraph decompositions generalising tree-width to directed graphs. These proposals have partly been motivated by attempts to develop a structure theory for digraphs similar to the graph minor theory developed by Robertson and Seymour for undirected graphs, and partly by the immense number of algorithmic results using tree-width of undirected graphs and the hope that part of this success might be reproducible on digraphs using a directed tree-width. Unfortunately the number of applications for the digraphs measures introduced so far is still small. We therefore explore the limits of the algorithmic applicability of digraph decompositions.

However, previous efforts have mostly focused on evolving the network connections and have often worked with a single, pre-engineered set of behaviours, limiting variability. This paper describes a method for encoding behaviours as a variable set of attributes, and shows that when the encoding is used with a genetic algorithm (GA), multiple sets of diverse behaviours can develop naturally and rapidly, providing much greater scope for flexible behaviour-selection. The algorithm is tested extensively with a simulated e-puck robot that navigates around a maze by tracking colour.

Unlike most of previous works, our approach reaches implementable, context-aware and dynamically adaptable architectures. To model the context, we manage simultaneously four parameters that influence Qos provided by the application. These parameters are: the available bandwidth, the exchanged data communication priority, the energy level and the available memory for processing. These parameters make it possible to refine the choice between the various architectural configurations when passing from a given abstraction level to the lower level which implements it. Our approach allows the importance degree associated with each parameter to be adapted dynamically. To implement adaptation, we switch between the various configurations of the same level, and we modify the state of the entities of a given configuration when necessary. We adopt the direct and mediated Producer- Consumer architectural styles and graphs for architecture modelling. In order to validate our approach we elaborate a simulation model.",08,[],7

The resulting algorithm is conceptually more simple, takes less free parameters than other ant-based clustering algorithms, and, after some parameter tuning, yields very good results on some benchmark problems.",08,[],7

In the second extension (called equation-ary transitive reduction), we have integer edge labeling and we view two paths as equivalent if they have the same beginning, ending and the sum of labels modulo equation. A solution equation is valid if it gives an equivalent path for every original path. For all problems we establish the following: polynomial time minimization of equation within ratio 1.5, maximization of equation within ratio 2, MAX-SNP hardness even of the length of simple cycles is limited to 5. Furthermore, we believe that the combinatorial technique behind the approximation algorithm for the minimization version might be of interest to other graph connectivity problems as well.",08,[],7

We subsequently explore four novel approaches to finding globally-optimal NMF solutions using various ideas from convex optimization. We then develop a new method, isometric NMF (isoNMF), which preserves non-negativity while also providing an isometric embedding, simultaneously achieving two properties which are helpful for interpretation.

Lower-layers have a major impact on upper-layer performance, and the complexity of the phenomena can not be entirely captured by analysis or simulation.

The presented communication architecture includes a MAC protocol which avoids building and maintaining neighborhood tables, and a geographically-inspired routing protocol over virtual coordinates. The application consists of a mobile sink interrogating a wireless sensor network based on the requests issued by a disconnected base station. After the design process of this architecture, we verify it functions correctly by simulation, and we perform a temporal verification. This study is needed to calculate the maximum speed the mobile sink can take.

However, many applications today work with input that is not precisely known, for example when the data is sensed and has some known error model. What if we do not know the set P exactly, but rather we have a probability distribution mup governing the location of each point p in P?   Consider a set of (non-fixed) points P, and let muP be the probability distribution of this set. We study several measures (e.g. the radius of the smallest enclosing ball, or the area of the smallest enclosing box) with respect to muP. The solutions to these problems do not, as in the traditional case, consist of a single answer, but rather a distribution of answers. We describe several data structures that approximate distributions of answers for shape fitting problems.   We provide simple and efficient randomized algorithms for computing all of these data structures, which are easy to implement and practical. We provide some experimental results to assert this.

Second, it will be shown that results can be further improved by adding another indirect optimisation layer. The decoder will not directly seek out low cost solutions but instead aims for good exploitable solutions. These are then post optimised by another hill-climbing algorithm.

Advertisers specify a budget constraint, as well as a maximum cost per click, and may not be assigned to more than one slot for a particular search.   We give a truthful mechanism under the utility model where bidders try to maximize their clicks, subject to their personal constraints. In addition, we show that the revenue-maximizing mechanism is not truthful, but has a Nash equilibrium whose outcome is identical to our mechanism. As far as we can tell, this is the first treatment of sponsored search that directly incorporates both multiple slots and budget constraints into an analysis of incentives.   Our mechanism employs a descending-price auction that maintains a solution to a certain machine scheduling problem whose job lengths depend on the price, and hence is variable over the auction. The price stops when the set of bidders that can afford that price pack exactly into a block of ad slots, at which point the mechanism allocates that block and continues on the remaining slots. To prove our result on the equilibrium of the revenue-maximizing mechanism, we first show that a greedy algorithm suffices to solve the revenue-maximizing linear program; we then use this insight to prove that bidders allocated in the same block of our mechanism have no incentive to deviate from bidding the fixed price of that block.",08,[],7

0809.2322,cs,"An ad-hoc wireless network is a collection of nodes that come together to dynamically create a network, with no fixed infrastructure or centralized administration. An ad-hoc network is characterized by energy constrained nodes, bandwidth constrained links and dynamic topology. With the growing use of wireless networks (including ad-hoc networks) for real-time applications, such as voice, video, and real-time data, the need for Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees in terms of delay, bandwidth, and packet loss is becoming increasingly important. Providing QoS in ad-hoc networks is a challenging task because of dynamic nature of network topology and imprecise state information. Hence, it is important to have a dynamic routing protocol with fast re-routing capability, which also provides stable route during the life-time of the flows.   In this thesis, we have proposed a novel, energy aware, stable routing protocol named, Stability-based QoS-capable Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (SQ-AODV), which is an enhancement of the well-known Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol for ad-hoc wireless networks. SQ-AODV utilizes a cross-layer design approach in which information about the residual energy of a node is used for route selection and maintenance. An important feature of SQ-AODV protocol is that it uses only local information and requires no additional communication or co-operation between the network nodes. SQ-AODV possesses a make-before-break re-routing capability that enables near-zero packet drops and is compatible with the basic AODV data formats and operation, making it easy to adopt in ad-hoc networks.",08,[],7

0811.0181,gr-qc,"All modern routes leading to a quantum theory of gravity -- i.e., perturbative quantum gravitational one-loop exact correction to the global chiral current in the standard model, string theory, and perhaps even loop quantum gravity -- require supplementing the Einstein-Hilbert action with a parity-violating Chern-Simons term. Such a term leads to amplitude-birefringent gravitational wave propagation: i.e., one (circular) polarization state amplified with propagation while the other is attenuated. The proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is capable of observing gravitational wave sources at cosmological distances, suggesting the possibility that LISA observations may place a strong bound on this manifestation of quantum gravity. Here we report on a calculation of the effect that spacetime amplitude birefringence has on the signal LISA is capable of observing from inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries at large redshift. We find that the birefringence manifests itself in the observations as an anomalous precession of the binary's orbital angular momentum as it evolves toward coalescence, whose magnitude depends on the integrated history of the Chern-Simons coupling over the worldline of radiation wavefront. We estimate that LISA could place bounds on Chern-Simons modified gravity that are several orders of magnitude stronger than the present Solar System constraints, thus providing a probe of the quantum structure of spacetime.",08,[],13

The GKod partition function contains an infinite set of 1PI vertices uniquely fixed, as a result of the semiclassical-quantum correspondence, by the first-order vertex. This implies the existence of a well-defined effective action for the partition function since the `phase' of the GKod, provided a finite state exists, is equivalent to this effective action. Additionally, the separation of the matter from the gravitational contributions bears a resemblance to the infinite dimensional analogue to Kaluza--Klein theory.

Convergence tests show that Pad\'e approximants of the gravitational wave energy flux do not accelerate the convergence of the standard Taylor approximants even in the test mass limit, and there is no reason why Pad\'e transformations should help in estimating parameters better in data analysis. Moreover, adding a pole to the flux seems unnecessary in the construction of these Pad\'e-approximated flux formulas. Pad\'e approximants may be useful in suggesting the form of fitting formulas. We compare a 15-orbit numerical waveform of the Caltech-Cornell group to the suggested Pad\'e waveforms of Damour et al. in the equal mass, nonspinning quasi-circular case. The comparison suggests that the Pad\'e waveforms do not agree better with the numerical waveform than the standard Taylor based waveforms. Based on this result, we design a simple EOB model by modifiying the ET EOB model of Buonanno et al., using the Taylor series of the flux with an unknown parameter at the fourth post-Newtonian order that we fit for. This simple EOB model generates a waveform having a phase difference of only 0.002 radians with the numerical waveform, much smaller than 0.04 radians the phase uncertainty in the numerical data itself.

The resulting theory becomes exactly Einstein-Maxwell theory in the limit as equation. For equation the field equations match the ordinary Einstein and Maxwell equations except for extra terms which are equation of the usual terms for worst-case field strengths and rates-of-change accessible to measurement. Additional fields can be included in the Lagrangian, and these fields may couple to the symmetric metric and the electromagnetic vector potential, just as in Einstein-Maxwell theory. The ordinary Lorentz force equation is obtained by taking the divergence of the Einstein equations when sources are included. The Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann (EIH) equations of motion match the equations of motion for Einstein-Maxwell theory to Newtonian/Coulombian order, which proves the existence of a Lorentz force without requiring sources.

0809.3314,gr-qc,"We introduce a quasi-local integral functional and scalar quasi-local variables to examine a wide class of spherically symmetric inhomogeneous spacetimes that generalize the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) dust solutions (""LTB"" spacetimes). By using these variables, we can transform the fluid flow evolution equations into evolution equations for non-linear, covariant, gauge--invariant perturbations of Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmologies. In the linear limit, we obtain spherical perturbations in the synchronous gauge under the long wavelength approximation. The formalism has a significant potential for cosmological applications, as it allows one to examine a wide variety of sources with different ""equations of state"", generalizing known FLRW solutions to idealized but non-trivial and non-linear inhomogeneous conditions. The quasi-local functional can be reformulated as a weighed proper volume average distribution, with the weight factor given by a scalar invariant related to the quasi-local mass-energy function. The back-reaction terms, emerging in Buchert's proper averaging formalism, can be expressed as differences between fluctuations of averaged and quasi-local energy densities. By comparing this average with the weighed quasi-local one, we can define a binding energy functional related to spatial gradients of the averaged and quasi-local variables that appear in the back-reaction terms.",08,[],13

0810.4515,gr-qc,"Often, geometries with horizons offer insights into the intricate relationships between general relativity and quantum physics. However, some subtle aspects of gravitating quantum systems might be difficult to ascertain using static backgrounds, since quantum mechanics incorporates dynamic measurability constraints (such as the uncertainty principle, etc.).   For this reason, the behaviors of quantum systems on a dynamic black hole background are explored in this paper. The velocities and trajectories of representative outgoing, ingoing, and stationary classical particles are calculated and contrasted, and the dynamics of simple quantum fields (both massless and massive) on the space-time are examined. Invariant densities associated with the quantum fields are exhibited on the Penrose diagram that represents the excreting black hole.   Furthermore, a generic approach for the consistent mutual gravitation of quanta in a manner that reproduces the given geometry is developed. The dynamics of the mutually gravitating quantum fields are expressed in terms of the affine parameter that describes local motions of a given quantum type on the space-time. Algebraic equations that relate the energy-momentum densities of the quantum fields to Einstein's tensor can then be developed. An example mutually gravitating system of macroscopically coherent quanta along with a core gravitating field is demonstrated. Since the approach is generic and algebraic, it can be used to represent a variety of systems with specified boundary conditions.",08,[],13

It is based on the routinely used in the ground base gravitational wave astronomy method of filtering the data through the bank of templates. However we use a novel Monte-Carlo based (stochastic) method to lay a grid in the parameter space, and we use the likelihood maximized analytically over some parameters, known as F-statistic, as a detection statistic. We build a coarse template bank to detect gravitational wave signals and to make preliminary parameter estimation.

0807.4874,gr-qc,"Different aspects of relativity, mainly in a canonical formulation, relevant for the question ""Is spacetime nothing more than a mathematical space (which describes the evolution in time of the ordinary three-dimensional world) or is it a mathematical model of a real four-dimensional world with time entirely given as the fourth dimension?"" are presented. The availability as well as clarity of the arguments depend on which framework is being used, for which currently special relativity, general relativity and some schemes of quantum gravity are available. Canonical gravity provides means to analyze the field equations as well as observable quantities, the latter even in coordinate independent form. This allows a unique perspective on the question of dimensionality since the space-time manifold does not play a prominent role. After re-introducing a Minkowski background into the formalism, one can see how distinguished coordinates of special relativity arise, where also the nature of time is different from that in the general perspective. Just as it is of advantage to extend special to general relativity, general relativity itself has to be extended to some theory of quantum gravity. This suggests that a final answer has to await a thorough formulation and understanding of a fundamental theory of space-time. Nevertheless, we argue that current insights into quantum gravity do not change the picture of the role of time obtained from general relativity.",08,[],13

The geometrical quantities can be then expressed in terms of embedding functions equation and their infinitesimal deformations equation. The deformations are called Einsteinian if they keep Einstein equations satisfied up to a given order in equation. The system so obtained is then analyzed in particular in the case of the Schwarzschild metric taken as the starting point, and some solutions of the first-order deformation of Einstein's equations are found.

0809.3667,hep-ph,"A large set of techniques needed to compute decay rates at the two-loop level are derived and systematized. The main emphasis of the paper is on the two Standard Model decays H -> gamma gamma and H -> g g. The techniques, however, have a much wider range of application: they give practical examples of general rules for two-loop renormalization; they introduce simple recipes for handling internal unstable particles in two-loop processes; they illustrate simple procedures for the extraction of collinear logarithms from the amplitude. The latter is particularly relevant to show cancellations, e.g. cancellation of collinear divergencies. Furthermore, the paper deals with the proper treatment of non-enhanced two-loop QCD and electroweak contributions to different physical (pseudo-)observables, showing how they can be transformed in a way that allows for a stable numerical integration. Numerical results for the two-loop percentage corrections to H -> gamma gamma, g g are presented and discussed. When applied to the process pp -> gg  X -> H  X, the results show that the electroweak scaling factor for the cross section is between -4 % and  6 % in the range 100 GeV < Mh < 500 GeV, without incongruent large effects around the physical electroweak thresholds, thereby showing that only a complete implementation of the computational scheme keeps two-loop corrections under control.",08,[],2

These constraints can also be derived with weaker assumptions, by demanding the existence of four-point amplitudes that factorize properly in all unitarity limits with complex momenta. From this starting point, we show that the BCFW prescription can be interpreted as an algorithm for fully constructing a tree-level S-matrix, and that complex factorization of general BCFW amplitudes follows from the factorization of four-particle amplitudes. The allowed set of BCFW deformations is identified, formulated entirely as a statement on the three-particle sector, and using only complex factorization as a guide. Consequently, our analysis based on the physical consistency of the S-matrix is entirely independent of field theory. We analyze the case of pure Yang-Mills, and outline a proof for gravity.

On the other hand, a background of thermal matter with moduli-dependent masses can also stabilize certain of the moduli, e.g., the radion. It is important to understand whether these two distinct mechanisms are compatible with each other, that is, that there are no interference terms that could spoil the moduli stabilization. In this paper, we study heterotic string theory on an N=1 orbifold near an enhanced symmetry point.

The resulting algebra encodes much information about the higher dimensional theory. In particular, tadpole equations and Bianchi identities are obtainable as Jacobi identities of the algebra. When a sector of magnetized (p,q) 7-branes is included, certain closed axions are gauged by the U(1) transformations on the branes. We indicate how the diagonal gauge generators of the branes can be incorporated into the full algebra, and show that Freed-Witten constraints and tadpole cancellation conditions for (p,q) 7-branes can be described as Jacobi identities satisfied by the algebra mixing bulk and brane gauge generators.",08,[],4
0805.2391,hep-th,"QFT with an external background can be considered as a consistent model only if backreaction is relatively small with respect to the background. To find the corresponding consistency restrictions on an external electric field and its duration in QED and QCD, we analyze the mean energy density of quantized fields for an arbitrary constant electric field E, acting during a large but finite time T. Using the corresponding asymptotics with respect to the dimensionless parameter equation, one can see that the leading contributions to the energy are due to the creation of paticles by the electric field. Assuming that these contributions are small in comparison with the energy density of the electric background, we establish the above-mentioned restrictions, which determine, in fact, the time scales from above of depletion of an electric field due to the backreaction",08,[],4
0805.0636,hep-th,"We consider correlator of two concentric Wilson loops, a small and large ones related to the problem of flux-tube formation. There are three mechanisms which can contribute to the connected correlator and yield different dependences on the radius of the small loop. The first one is quite standard and concerns exchange by supergravity modes. We also consider a novel mechanism when the flux-tube formation is described by a barrier transition in the string language, dual to the field-theoretic formulation of Yang-Mills theories. The most interesting possibility within this approach is resonant tunneling which would enhance the correlator of the Wilson loops for particular geometries. The third possibility involves exchange by a dyonic string supplied with the string junction. We introduce also t'Hooft and composite dyonic loops as probes of the flux tube.

0802.0311,hep-th,"The axion photon system in an external magnetic field, when the direction of propagation of axions and photons is orthogonal to the direction of the external magnetic field, displays a continuous axion-photon duality symmetry in the limit the axion mass is neglected. The conservation law that follow in this effective 21 dimensional theory from this symmetry is obtained. The magnetic field interaction is seen to be equivalent to first order to the interaction of a complex charged field with an external electric potential, where this ficticious ""electric potential"" is proportional to the external magnetic field. This allows one to solve for the scattering amplitudes using already known scalar QED results. From the scalar QED analog the axion and the photon are symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of particle and antiparticle. If one considers therefore scattering experiments in which the two spatial dimensions of the effective theory are involved non trivially, one observes that both particle and antiparticle components of photons and axions are preferentially scattered in different directions, thus producing the splitting or decomposition of the photon and axion into their particle and antiparticle components in an inhomogeneous magnetic field. This observable in principle effect is of first order in the axion photon coupling, unlike the ""light shining through a wall phenomena "", which is second order.",08,[],4

0810.2154,math,"The problem of construction of Barabanov norms for analysis of properties of the joint (generalized) spectral radius of matrix sets has been discussed in a number of publications. The method of Barabanov norms was the key instrument in disproving the Lagarias-Wang Finiteness Conjecture. The related constructions were essentially based on the study of the geometrical properties of the unit balls of some specific Barabanov norms. In this context the situation when one fails to find among current publications any detailed analysis of the geometrical properties of the unit balls of Barabanov norms looks a bit paradoxical. Partially this is explained by the fact that Barabanov norms are defined nonconstructively, by an implicit procedure. So, even in simplest cases it is very difficult to visualize the shape of their unit balls. The present work may be treated as the first step to make up this deficiency. In the paper two iteration procedure are considered that allow to build numerically Barabanov norms for the irreducible matrix sets and simultaneously to compute the joint spectral radius of these sets.",08,[],0

0808.2457,math,"The theory of Nevanlinna-Pick and Carath\'eodory-Fej\'er interpolation for matrix- and operator-valued Schur class functions on the unit disk is now well established. Recent work has produced extensions of the theory to a variety of multivariable settings, including the ball and the polydisk (both commutative and noncommutative versions), as well as a time-varying analogue. Largely independent of this is the recent Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation theorem by P.S. Muhly and B. Solel for an abstract Hardy algebra set in the context of a Fock space built from a equation-correspondence E over a equation-algebra equation and a *-representation equation of equation. In this review we provide an exposition of the Muhly-Solel interpolation theory accessible to operator theorists, and explain more fully the connections with the already existing interpolation literature. The abstract point evaluation first introduced by Muhly-Solel leads to a tensor-product type functional calculus in the main examples. A second kind of point-evaluation for the equation-correspondence Hardy algebra, also introduced by Muhly and Solel, is here further investigated, and a Nevanlinna-Pick theorem in this setting is proved. It turns out that, when specified for examples, this alternative point-evaluation leads to an operator-argument functional calculus and corresponding Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation.

On a bounded domain of equation, we justify the global bifurcation of nontrivial equilibrium solutions for a reaction term equation, with equation as a bifurcation parameter. The global bifurcation result is used to show that any solution equation, initiating form initial data equation (equation), equation, tends to the unique nonnegative (nonpositive) equilibrium.",08,[],0
0803.1685,math,We give a definition of the spectral flow for continuous paths in the space of bounded and essentially hyperbolic operators. We provide a homotopical characterization of the spectral flow in terms of a group homomorphism of the fundamental group of the projectors of the Calkin algebra with the infinite cyclic group Z. This characterization helps us to exhibit examples of infinite-dimensional Banach spaces where the spectral flow is not injective nor surjective. We prove that a path with spectral flow equal to an integer m exists if and only if there exists a projector P connected by an arc to a projector Q such that Range(Q) has co-dimension m in Range(P). We prove that if A is an asymptotically hyperbolic and essentially splitting path the differential operator F(u) = du/dt - Au is Fredholm. Moreover if A is also essentially hyperbolic the Fredholm index coincides with minus the spectral flow of A.,08,[],0

0805.2315,nlin,"The study and characterization of the diversity of spatiotemporal patterns generated when a rectangular layer of fluid is locally heated beneath its free surface is presented. We focus on the instability of a stationary cellular pattern of wave number equation which undergoes a globally subcritical transition to traveling waves by parity-breaking symmetry. The experimental results show how the emerging traveling mode (equation) switches on a resonant triad (equation, equation, equation) within the cellular pattern yielding a 'mixed' pattern. The nature of this transition is described quantitatively in terms of the evolution of the fundamental modes by complex demodulation techniques. The B\' enard-Marangoni convection accounts for the different dynamics depending on the depth of the fluid layer and on the vertical temperature difference. The existence of a hysteresis cycle has been evaluated quantitatively. When the bifurcation to traveling waves is measured in the vicinity of the codimension-2 bifurcation point, we measure a decrease of the subcritical interval in which the traveling mode becomes unstable. From the traveling wave state the system under goes a \it new global secondary bifurcation to an alternating pattern which doubles the wavelength (equation) of the primary cellular pattern, this result compares well with theoretical predictions [P. Coullet and G. Ioss, \em Phys. Rev. Lett. \bf 64, 8 66 (1990)].

In this paper we study nonlinear oscillatory systems consisting of two media separated by an interface, and find a novel phenomenon: interface can select a type of waves (ISWs). Under certain well defined parameter condition, these waves propagate in two different media with same frequency and same wave number; the interface of two media is transparent to these waves. The frequency and wave number of these interface-selected waves (ISWs) are predicted explicitly. Varying parameters from this parameter set, the wave numbers of two domains become different, and the difference increases from zero continuously as the distance between the given parameters and this parameter set increases from zero. It is found that ISWs can play crucial roles in practical problems of wave competitions, e.g., ISWs can suppress spirals and antispirals.",08,[],9

Even the qualitative dependence of spatiotemporal regularity on equation changes drastically as the angular frequency of the oscillators change, ranging from monotonic increase or monotonic decrease, to non-monotonic variation.

0807.3848,nlin,"Transport and mixing properties of surface currents can be detected from altimetric data by both Eulerian and Lagrangian diagnostics. In contrast with Eulerian diagnostics, Lagrangian tools like the local Lyapunov exponents have the advantage of exploiting both spatial and temporal variability of the velocity field and are in principle able to unveil subgrid filaments generated by chaotic stirring. However, one may wonder whether this theoretical advantage is of practical interest in real-data, mesoscale and submesoscale analysis, because of the uncertainties and resolution of altimetric products, and the non-passive nature of biogeochemical tracers. Here we compare the ability of standard Eulerian diagnostics and the finite-size Lyapunov exponent in detecting instantaneaous and climatological transport and mixing properties. By comparing with sea-surface temperature patterns, we find that the two diagnostics provide similar results for slowly evolving eddies like the first Alboran gyre. However, the Lyapunov exponent is also able to predict the (sub-)mesoscale filamentary process occuring along the Algerian current and above the Balearic Abyssal Plain. Such filaments are also observed, with some mismatch, in sea-surface temperature patterns. Climatologies of Lyapunov exponents do not show any compact relation with other Eulerian diagnostics, unveiling a different structure even at the basin scale.

0801.0924,nucl-th,"A new strategy of fitting the coupling constants of the nuclear energy density functional is proposed, which shifts attention from ground-state bulk to single-particle properties. The latter are analyzed in terms of the bare single-particle energies and mass, shape, and spin core-polarization effects. Fit of the isoscalar spin-orbit and both isoscalar and isovector tensor coupling constants directly to the f5/2-f7/2 spin-orbit splittings in 40Ca, 56Ni, and 48Ca is proposed as a practical realization of this new programme. It is shown that this fit requires drastic changes in the isoscalar spin-orbit strength and the tensor coupling constants as compared to the commonly accepted values but it considerably and systematically improves basic single-particle properties including spin-orbit splittings and magic-gap energies. Impact of these changes on nuclear binding energies is also discussed.",08,[],11

Two 0, one 2, one 1- and one 0- bound states are found where the first four are known experimentally whereas the 0- is predicted as an isomeric state. An effective neutron charge, reproducing the measured B(E1) transition and the charge rms radius in 11Be, leads to a computed B(E1) transition strength for 12Be in agreement with the experimental value.

0811.2880,nucl-th,"Heavy Ion Collisions (HIC) represent a unique tool to probe the in-medium nuclear interaction in regions away from saturation. In this report we present a selection of new reaction observables in dissipative collisions particularly sensitive to the symmetry term of the nuclear Equation of State (Iso-EoS). We will first discuss the Isospin Equilibration Dynamics. At low energies this manifests via the recently observed Dynamical Dipole Radiation, due to a collective neutron-proton oscillation with the symmetry term acting as a restoring force. At higher beam energies Iso-EoS effects will be seen in Imbalance Ratio Measurements, in particular from the correlations with the total kinetic energy loss. For fragmentation reactions in central events we suggest to look at the coupling between isospin distillation and radial flow. In Neck Fragmentation reactions important equation information can be obtained from the correlation between isospin content and alignement. The high density symmetry term can be probed from isospin effects on heavy ion reactions at relativistic energies (few AGeV range). Rather isospin sensitive observables are proposed from nucleon/cluster emissions, collective flows and meson production. The possibility to shed light on the controversial neutron/proton effective mass splitting in asymmetric matter is also suggested. A large symmetry repulsion at high baryon density will also lead to an ""earlier"" hadron-deconfinement transition in n-rich matter. A suitable treatment of the isovector interaction in the partonic EoS appears very relevant.",08,[],11

The equation meson has opposite effects on hadronic matter with or without hyperons: it softens the EOSes of hadronic matter with hyperons, while it stiffens the EOSes of pure nucleonic matter. Furthermore, the leptons and the hyperons have the similar influence on equation meson effects. The equation meson increases the maximum masses of neutron stars.

We account for known cold nuclear matter effects, such as the isospin effect, the Cronin effect, shadowing and cold nuclear matter energy loss. It is shown that at high equation the nuclear modification factor for direct photons equation is dominated by cold nuclear matter effects and there is no evidence for large cross section amplification due to medium-induced photon bremsstrahlung and jet-photon conversion in the medium.

0806.2885,physics,"We propose a new method to test the effectiveness of a spatial point process forecast based on a log-likelihood score for predicted point density and the information gain for events that actually occurred in the test period. The method largely avoids simulation use and allows us to calculate the information score for each event or set of events as well as the standard error of each forecast. As the number of predicted events increases, the score distribution approaches the Gaussian law. The degree of its similarity to the Gaussian distribution can be measured by the computed coefficients of skewness and kurtosis. To display the forecasted point density and the point events, we use an event concentration diagram or a variant of the Error Diagram (ED).   We demonstrate the application of the method by using our long-term forecast of seismicity in two western Pacific regions. We compare the ED for these regions with simplified diagrams based on two-segment approximations. Since the earthquakes in these regions are concentrated in narrow subduction belts, using the forecast density as a template or baseline for the ED is a more convenient display technique. We also show, using simulated event occurrence, that some proposed criteria for measuring forecast effectiveness at EDs would be strongly biased for a small event number.",08,[],5

In addition, we argue that cancellation of gravitational charges in virtual particle-antiparticle pairs, may be a basis for a solution of the cosmological constant problem and identification of dark energy with vacuum energy.

0802.3714,physics,"The effect of rotation is considered to become important when the Rossby number is sufficiently small, as is the case in many geophysical and astrophysical flows. Here we present direct numerical simulations to study the effect of rotation in flows with moderate Rossby numbers (down to Ro~0.1) but at Reynolds numbers large enough to observe the beginning of a turbulent scaling at scales smaller than the energy injection scale. We use coherent forcing at intermediate scales, leaving enough room in the spectral space for an inverse cascade of energy to also develop. We analyze the spectral behavior of the simulations, the shell-to-shell energy transfer, scaling laws, and intermittency, as well as the geometry of the structures in the flow. At late times, the direct transfer of energy at small scales is mediated by interactions with the largest scale in the system, the energy containing eddies with kperp~1, where ""perp"" refers to wavevectors perpendicular the axis of rotation. The transfer between modes with wavevector parallel to the rotation is strongly quenched. The inverse cascade of energy at scales larger than the energy injection scale is non-local, and energy is transferred directly from small scales to the largest available scale. Also, as time evolves and the energy piles up at the large scales, the intermittency of the direct cascade of energy is preserved while corrections due to intermittency are found to be the same (within error bars) as in homogeneous turbulence.",08,[],5

In this contribution, we show that the geometry of topographic isolines is an appropriate observable to help disentangle such a relationship. A fractal analysis of terrestrial isolines yields a clear identification of trenches and abyssal plains, differentiates oceanic ridges from continental slopes and platforms, localizes coastlines and river systems, and isolates areas at high elevation (or latitude) subjected to the erosive action of ice.

0803.3437,physics,"On the basis of a gaussian quasi-chemical model of hydration, a model of non van der Waals character, we explore the role of attractive methane-water interactions in the hydration of methane and in the potential of mean force between two methane molecules in water. We find that the hydration of methane is dominated by packing and a mean-field energetic contribution. Contributions beyond the mean-field term are unimportant in the hydration phenomena for a hydrophobic solute such as methane. Attractive solute-water interactions make a net repulsive contribution to these pair potentials of mean force. With no conditioning, the observed distributions of binding energies are super-gaussian and can be effectively modeled by a Gumbel (extreme value) distribution. This further supports the view that the characteristic form of the unconditioned distribution in the high-e tail is due to energetic interactions with a small number of molecules. Generalized extreme value distributions also effectively model the results with minimal conditioning, but in those cases the distributions are sufficiently narrow that details of their shape aren't significant.",08,[],5
0805.1407,physics,"Bipartite graphs have received some attention in the study of social networks and of biological mutualistic systems. A generalization of a previous model is presented, that evolves the topology of the graph in order to optimally account for a given Contact Preference Rule between the two guilds of the network. As a result, social and biological graphs are classified as belonging to two clearly different classes. Projected graphs, linking the agents of only one guild, are obtained from the original bipartite graph. The corresponding evolution of its statistical properties is also studied. An example of a biological mutualistic network is analyzed in great detail, and it is found that the model provides a very good quantitative fitting of its properties. The model also provides a proper qualitative description of the statistical features observed in social webs, suggesting the possible reasons underlying the difference in the organization of these two kinds of bipartite networks.",08,[],5
0801.2683,physics,"We investigate directly at the microscale the morphology of the electrowetting induced transition between the Cassie-Baxter and Wenzel states for a water droplet on a superhydrophobic surface. Our experiments demonstrate that the transition originates in a very narrow annular region near the macroscopic contact line, which is first invaded by water and causes a thin film of air to be entrapped below. At high applied voltages, a growing fraction of microscopic air-pockets collapse, resulting in a partialWenzel state. Modulations in the intensity of the light reflected from individual micro-menisci clarify that the local contact angles near the filling transition are close to the usual advancing values for contact lines on smooth surfaces.",08,[],5

Using this signature and energetic stability as criteria and SCH3 for SR, we compare four candidate structures: two from others and two we obtained. Our models are distinct from others in that thiolate groups form monomers and dimers of the staple motif (a nearly linear RS-Au-SR bonding unit). We examine the energetics and electronic structures of the four structures with density functional theory (DFT) and compute their optical spectra with time-dependent DFT. We show that our dimer-dominated model is over 2.6 eV lower in energy than the two models from others and 1.3 eV lower than our previous monomer-dominated model.

It is found that the Lagrangian acceleration is even more intermittent in the confined domain than in the periodic domain. The flatness of the Lagrangian acceleration as a function of the radius shows that the influence of the wall on the Lagrangian dynamics becomes negligible in the center of the domain and it also reveals that the wall is responsible for the increased intermittency. The transition in the Lagrangian statistics between this region, not directly influenced by the walls, and a critical radius which defines a Lagrangian boundary layer, is shown to be very sharp with a sudden increase of the acceleration flatness from about 5 to about 20.",08,[],5

In contrast to the case of undirected and unweighted networks, the fixation probability of a mutant in directed networks is characterized not only by the degree of the node that the mutant initially invades but by the global structure of networks.

0803.3673,physics,"A quantum mechanical approach is proposed for the formation of antihydrogen in the ground and excited states (2s, 2p) via the mechanism of three body recombination (TBR) inside a trapped plasma of anti proton and positron or in the collision between the two beams of them. Variations of the differential (DCS) as well as the total (TCS) formation cross sections are studied as a function of the incident energies of both the active and the spectator positrons. Significantly large cross sections are found at very low incident energies in the TBR process as compared to other processes leading to antihydrogen. The present formation cross section decreases with increasing positron energy (temperature) but no simple power law could be predicted for it covering the entire energy range, corroborating the experimental findings qualitatively. The formation cross sections are found to be much higher for unequal energies of the two positrons than for equal energies, as expected physically.",08,[],5

0801.0780,physics,"Although it is acknowledged that GRB redshift is cosmological at present, but it in fact has never been confirmed. However, the fact is still unclear because which may be cosmological redshift (including possibly the host galaxy redshift or the background galaxy redshift) or the redshift results from gravity of neutron star; in other words, GRB redshift may be related to its distance or not. Here, I enumerate a series of evidences, including three methods, to determine whether the GRB distance does depend on the redshift. Firstly, the correlation analysis shows that there is no correlation between the fluence of 131 GRBs (and the 1 s peak photon flux of 111 GRBs) and the redshift although there is a significant correlation between the apparent magnitude of 32 hosts and the redshift. Secondly, from the number-redshift relation of GRBs and the deductive reasoning, one can deduce an absurd conclusion that the probability of a nearby galaxy generating a GRB event would vary inversely as its distance square if GRB indeed comes from an external galaxy and the distance depends on the redshift. Thirdly, if the distance is related to the redshift, then the variables of fluence and peak flux definitely cannot be separated from the variable of redshift in distribution functions of both the fluence-redshift and the peak flux-redshift; while the variables separation tests show that they in effect do, and we then can exactly forecast the values of the fluence and the peak flux for the GRBs with redshift z > 4.5. Other evidences all show that GRB distance is independent from the redshift without exception.",08,[],5
0810.5297,physics,"This paper is focused on soil subsidence of small extend and amplitude caused by tunnel boring or the collapse of underground cavities, whether natural or man-made. The impact of the movements of the ground on existing structures is generally dramatic. It is therefore necessary to accurately predict these movements (settlements and horizontal extension or compression displacements). Even though it is obvious that the overall stiffness and weight of the structure influences the size and shape of the soil movement, the main features of this soil-structure interaction phenomenon are not well established. Caudron et al. (2006) developed an original small-scale physical model to take the soil-structure interaction into account. It is based on the use of the frictional Schneebeli material (assembly of small diameter rods) and a modified version including cohesion in order to reproduce a cohesive layer above a cavity. The displacements of the soil are obtained from digital images processing by particle image velocimetry (PIV). Interesting results were obtained, probing that the soil-structure interactions could be analysed by this experimental model. This article is focused in a first part on the influence of the position of the structure with respect to the cavity position. Consequences on the areas mainly concerned by horizontal compression or extension of the structure are determined. It appears that the stresses induced in the building are a superposition of several elementary loading (sum of the effects of the slope, the horizontal deformations and the curvature). The second part concerns the effect of the relative soil/structure stiffness on the ground movement during a cavity collapse by considering a second model of structure with similar dimensions but more flexible.",08,[],5

We experimentally observe the breakup of such beams into multiple fragments and identify the mechanism of this breakup as the combined effect of two- and three-photon-absorption. We show that the multiple breakup persists even when the value of two-photon-absorption is reduced by an order of magnitude owing to the high value of three-photon-absorption of AlGaAs at the half band-gap. The experimental results extend known mechanism of soliton breakup induced by two-photon-absorption and agree well with numerical beam propagation simulations.,08,[],5

For verification, over-temperature protection behavior of Smart Power Switches is employed. This protection turns off the switch at a pre-defined temperature which is used as a temperature reference in the investigation. Power dissipation generated during a thermal overload event of two Smart Power devices is measured and used as an input stimulus to transient thermal FEM simulations. The duration time of the event together with the temperature reference is confronted with simulation results and thus the validity of the silicon model is proved. In addition, the impact of non-linear thermal properties of silicon on the thermal impedance of power semiconductors is shown.",08,[],5

Leakage currents were read continuously during the irradiation. The delivery of the protons was paused periodically to record scope traces in response to calibrated light pulses to monitor the gains, photon detection efficiencies, and dark counts of the SiPMs. The leakage current and dark noise are found to increase with fluence. Te leakage current is found to be proportional to the mean square deviation of the noise distribution, indicating the dark counts are due to increased random individual pixel activation, while SiPMs remain fully functional as photon detectors.

Acoustic and perceptual analyses of the rounded vowel [u] produced by twelve 4-year-old French speakers were conducted under two conditions: normal and with a 15-mm-diameter tube inserted between the lips. Recordings of isolated vowels were made in the normal condition before any perturbation (N1), immediately upon insertion of the tube and for the next 19 trials in this perturbed condition, with (P2) or without articulatory instructions (P1), and in the normal condition after the perturbed trials (N2). The results of the acoustic analyses reveal speaker-dependent alterations of F1, F2, and/or F0 in the perturbed conditions and after the removal of the tube. For some subjects, the presence of the tube resulted in very little change; for others, an increase in F2 was observed in P1, which was generally reduced in some of the 20 repetitions, but not systematically and not continuously. The use of articulatory instructions provided in the P2 condition was detrimental to the achievement of a good acoustic target.

0811.4727,physics,"The ion-sputtering (IS) process is active in many planetary environments in the Solar System where plasma precipitates directly on the surface (for instance, Mercury, Moon, Europa). In particular, solar-wind sputtering is one of the most important agents for the surface erosion of a Near-Earth Object (NEO), acting together with other surface release processes, such as Photon Stimulated Desorption (PSD), Thermal Desorption (TD) and Micrometeoroid Impact Vaporization (MIV). The energy distribution of the IS-released neutrals peaks at a few eVs and extends up to hundreds of eVs. Since all other release processes produce particles of lower energies, the presence of neutral atoms in the energy range above 10 eV and below a few keVs (Sputtered High-Energy Atoms - SHEA) identifies the IS process. SHEA easily escape from the NEO, due to NEO's extremely weak gravity. Detection and analysis of SHEA will give important information on surface-loss processes as well as on surface elemental composition. The investigation of the active release processes, as a function of the external conditions and the NEO surface properties, is crucial for obtaining a clear view of the body's present loss rate as well as for getting clues on its evolution, which depends significantly on space weather. In this work, an attempt to analyze the processes that take place on the surface of these small airless bodies, as a result of their exposure to the space environment, has been realized.

We present a model for vascular remodeling in tumors predicting that the formation of hot spots correlates with local inhomogeneities of the original arterio-venous vasculature of the healthy tissue. Probable locations for hot spots in the late stages of the tumor are locations of increased blood pressure gradients. The developing tumor vasculature is non-hierarchical but still complex displaying algebraically decaying density distributions.,08,[],10

In particular we consider the average abundances of two strategies, A and B, under mutation and selection. The game dynamical interaction between the two strategies is given by the 2x2 payoff matrix [(a,b), (c,d)]. It has previously been shown that A is more abundant than B, if (N-2)aNb>Nc(N-2)d. This result has been derived for particular stochastic processes that operate either in the limit of asymptotically small mutation rates or in the limit of weak selection.

0801.2033,q-bio,"Over the last decade, a large variety of clustering algorithms have been developed to detect coregulatory relationships among genes from microarray gene expression data. Model based clustering approaches have emerged as statistically well grounded methods, but the properties of these algorithms when applied to large-scale data sets are not always well understood. An in-depth analysis can reveal important insights about the performance of the algorithm, the expected quality of the output clusters, and the possibilities for extracting more relevant information out of a particular data set. We have extended an existing algorithm for model based clustering of genes to simultaneously cluster genes and conditions, and used three large compendia of gene expression data for S. cerevisiae to analyze its properties. The algorithm uses a Bayesian approach and a Gibbs sampling procedure to iteratively update the cluster assignment of each gene and condition. For large-scale data sets, the posterior distribution is strongly peaked on a limited number of equiprobable clusterings. A GO annotation analysis shows that these local maxima are all biologically equally significant, and that simultaneously clustering genes and conditions performs better than only clustering genes and assuming independent conditions. A collection of distinct equivalent clusterings can be summarized as a weighted graph on the set of genes, from which we extract fuzzy, overlapping clusters using a graph spectral method. The cores of these fuzzy clusters contain tight sets of strongly coexpressed genes, while the overlaps exhibit relations between genes showing only partial coexpression.",08,[],10
0809.1717,q-bio,"The gamma-aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB) receptor is an allosteric complex made of two subunits, GABAB1 (GB1) and GABAB2 (GB2). Both subunits are composed of an extracellular Venus flytrap domain (VFT) and a heptahelical domain (HD). GB1 binds GABA, and GB2 plays a major role in G-protein activation as well as in the high agonist affinity state of GB1. How agonist affinity in GB1 is regulated in the receptor remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that GB2 VFT is a major molecular determinant involved in this control. We show that isolated versions of GB1 and GB2 VFTs in the absence of the HD and C-terminal tail can form hetero-oligomers as shown by time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (based on HTRF technology). GB2 VFT and its association with GB1 VFT controlled agonist affinity in GB1 in two ways. First, GB2 VFT exerted a direct action on GB1 VFT, as it slightly increased agonist affinity in isolated GB1 VFT. Second and most importantly, GB2 VFT prevented inhibitory interaction between the two main domains (VFT and HD) of GB1. According to this model, we propose that GB1 HD prevents the possible natural closure of GB1 VFT. In contrast, GB2 VFT facilitates this closure. Finally, such inhibitory contacts between HD and VFT in GB1 could be similar to those important to maintain the inactive state of the receptor.",08,[],10

To understand the regulation mechanism, we investigate the structural fluctuation of KIF1A in different nucleotide states that are realized in the ATP hydrolysis process by molecular dynamics simulations of Go-like model. We found that ""alpha4 helix"", which is a part of the microtubule (MT) binding site, changes its fluctuation systematically according to the nucleotide states. In particular, the frequency of large fluctuations of alpha4 strongly correlates with the affinity of KIF1A for microtubule. We also show how the strength of the thermal fluctuation and the interaction with the nucleotide affect the dynamics of microtubule binding site. These results suggest that KIF1A regulates the affinity to MT by changing the flexibility of alpha4 helix according to the nucleotide states.",08,[],10

A quantitative understanding of the processes involved, which currently remains lacking, will be useful in determining the etiology and treatment of obesity and other conditions resulting from prolonged energy imbalance. Here, we show that the long-term dynamics of human weight change can be captured by a mathematical model of the macronutrient flux balances and all previous models are special cases of this model. We show that the generic dynamical behavior of body composition for a clamped diet can be divided into two classes. In the first class, the body composition and mass are determined uniquely. In the second class, the body composition can exist at an infinite number of possible states. Surprisingly, perturbations of dietary energy intake or energy expenditure can give identical responses in both model classes and existing data are insufficient to distinguish between these two possibilities. However, this distinction is important for the efficacy of clinical interventions that alter body composition and mass.",08,[],10

Myosin II, working in an ensemble, however, was explained by a loose coupling mechanism, generating variable step sizes depending on the ATP concentration and realizing a much larger step (200 nm) per ATP hydrolysis than myosin V through its cooperative nature at zero load.

The genomic data may help us understand the driving force of evolution of life at molecular level. In absence of evidence, numerous problems in molecular evolution had to fall into a twilight zone of speculation and controversy in the past. Here we show that delicate structures of variations of genomic base compositions and amino acid frequencies resulted from the genetic code evolution. And the driving force of evolution of life also originated in the genetic code evolution. The theoretical results on the variations of amino acid frequencies and genomic base compositions agree with the experimental observations very well, not only in the variation trends but also in some fine structures. Inversely, the genomic data of contemporary species can help reconstruct the genetic code chronology and amino acid chronology in primordial period.

For neurons in extrastriate motion area MT, a combinatorial code, one that keeps track of the cell identity of action potentials and silences in individual neurons across the population, carries twice as much information about visual motion as does spike count averaged over the same group of cells. The combinatorial code is more informative because of the diverse firing rate dynamics of MT neurons in response to constant motion stimuli, and is robust to neuron-neuron correlations.

0810.4355,q-bio,"Background: Alignment of biological sequences such as DNA, RNA or proteins is one of the most widely used tools in computational bioscience. All existing alignment algorithms rely on heuristic scoring schemes based on biological expertise. Therefore, these algorithms do not provide model independent and objective measures for how similar two (or more) sequences actually are. Although information theory provides such a similarity measure -- the mutual information (MI) -- previous attempts to connect sequence alignment and information theory have not produced realistic estimates for the MI from a given alignment.   Results: Here we describe a simple and flexible approach to get robust estimates of MI from \it global alignments. For mammalian mitochondrial DNA, our approach gives pairwise MI estimates for commonly used global alignment algorithms that are strikingly close to estimates obtained by an entirely unrelated approach -- concatenating and zipping the sequences.   Conclusions: This remarkable consistency may help establish MI as a reliable tool for evaluating the quality of global alignments, judging the relative merits of different alignment algorithms, and estimating the significance of specific alignments. We expect that our approach can be extended to establish further connections between information theory and sequence alignment, including applications to local and multiple alignment procedures.",08,[],10

0809.0637,q-bio,"The binding of a ligand molecule to a protein is often accompanied by conformational changes of the protein. A central question is whether the ligand induces the conformational change (induced-fit), or rather selects and stabilizes a complementary conformation from a pre-existing equilibrium of ground and excited states of the protein (selected-fit). We consider here the binding kinetics in a simple four-state model of ligand-protein binding. In this model, the protein has two conformations, which can both bind the ligand. The first conformation is the ground state of the protein when the ligand is off, and the second conformation is the ground state when the ligand is bound. The induced-fit mechanism corresponds to ligand binding in the unbound ground state, and the selected-fit mechanism to ligand binding in the excited state. We find a simple, characteristic difference between the on- and off-rates in the two mechanisms if the conformational relaxation into the ground states is fast. In the case of selected-fit binding, the on-rate depends on the conformational equilibrium constant, while the off-rate is independent. In the case of induced-fit binding, in contrast, the off-rate depends on the conformational equilibrium, while the on-rate is independent. Whether a protein binds a ligand via selected-fit or induced-fit thus may be revealed by mutations far from the protein's binding pocket, or other ""perturbations"" that only affect the conformational equilibrium. In the case of selected-fit, such mutations will only change the on-rate, and in the case of induced-fit, only the off-rate.",08,[],10
0811.2189,q-bio,"Results from molecular systematics and comparative developmental genetics changed the picture of metazoan and especially bilaterian radiation. According to this new animal phylogeny (introduced by Adoutte et al. 1999/2000), Grobbens (1908) widely favoured protostome-deuterostome division of the Bilateria can be upheld, but only with major rearrangements within these superphyla. On the cladogenetic level, the Protostomia are split into two unexpected subgroups, the Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa. The deuterostomes are split into the subgroups Chordata and Ambulacraria, which is not novel since Grobben (1908) introduced the Deuterostomia in this way (together with the Chaetognatha as a third line). However, many details of the new deuterostome phylogeny do not fit traditional, morphology-based reconstructions. As a consequence, three relatively unexpected proposals for early deuterostome evolution are favoured today: An ambulacraria-scenario, a xenoturbellid-scenario, and a chordate-scenario. The first two proposals are often discussed in the literature, while the chordate-scenario is almost completely neglected. Therefore, the paper presented focuses on the chordate scenario, i.e. the hypothesis of an acrania-like ur-deuterostomian. It is argued that the acrania-hypothesis is clearly preferable when biomechanic options of a polysegmented, hydroskeletal body plan are taken into account. The so called hydroskeleton hypothesis, rooted in the work of W. F. Gutmann, is the most detailed anagenetic scenario which depicts an acrania-like ur-deuterostome.",08,[],10

The spine, or vertebral column, represents a chain of 26 movable vertebral bodies, joint together by transversal viscoelastic intervertebral discs and longitudinal elastic tendons. This paper proposes a new locally-coupled loading-rate hypothesis, which states that the main cause of both soft- and hard-tissue spinal injury is a localized Euclidean jolt, or SE(3)-jolt, an impulsive loading that strikes a localized spine in several coupled degrees-of-freedom simultaneously. To show this, based on the previously defined covariant force law, we formulate the coupled Newton-Euler dynamics of the local spinal motions and derive from it the corresponding coupled SE(3)-jolt dynamics. The SE(3)-jolt is the main cause of two basic forms of spinal injury: (i) hard-tissue injury of local translational dislocations; and (ii) soft-tissue injury of local rotational disclinations. Both the spinal dislocations and disclinations, as caused by the SE(3)-jolt, are described using the Cosserat multipolar viscoelastic continuum model.

If the interactions between the proteins are dominated by the excluded volume effects, the net folding times are essentially like for a single protein. An introduction of inter-proteinic attractive contacts hinders folding when the strength of the attraction exceeds about a half of the value of the strength of the single protein contacts. The bigger the strength of the attraction, the more likely is the occurrence of aggregation and misfolding.",08,[],10
0812.2057,q-bio,"Physiological changes which result in changes in bacterial gene expression are often accompanied by changes in the growth rate for fast adapting enteric bacteria. Since the availability of RNA polymerase (RNAP) in cells is dependent on the growth rate, transcriptional control involves not only the regulation of promoters, but also depends on the available (or free) RNAP concentration which is difficult to quantify directly. Here we develop a simple physical model describing the partitioning of cellular RNAP into different classes: RNAPs transcribing mRNA and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), RNAPs non-specifically bound to DNA, free RNAP, and immature RNAP. Available experimental data for E. coli allow us to determine the two unknown parameters of the model and hence deduce the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. The results allow us to predict the growth-rate dependence of the activities of constitutive (unregulated) promoters, and to disentangle the growth-rate dependent regulation of promoters (e.g., the promoters of rRNA operons) from changes in transcription due to changes in the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. Our model can quantitatively account for the observed changes in gene expression patterns in mutant E. coli strains with altered levels of RNAP expression without invoking additional parameters. Applying our model to the case of the stringent response following amino acid starvation, we can evaluate the plausibility of various scenarios of passive transcriptional control proposed to account for the observed changes in the expression of rRNA and biosynthetic operons.",08,[],10

We present a Brownian Dynamics algorithm for reaction-diffusion systems that rigorously obeys detailed balance for equilibrium reactions. By comparing the simulation results to exact analytical results for a bimolecular reaction, we show that the algorithm correctly reproduces both equilibrium and dynamical quantities.

The current work addresses this issue by considering simplified neuronal shapes consisting of circular regions (soma/axons) with spokes (dendrites). Networks are grown by placing these patterns randomly in the 2D plane and establishing connections whenever a piece of dendrite falls inside an axon. Several topological and dynamical properties of the resulting graph are measured, including the degree distribution, clustering coefficients, symmetry of connections, size of the largest connected component, as well as three hierarchical measurements of the local topology. By varying the number of processes of the individual basic patterns, we can quantify relationships between the individual neuronal shape and the topological and dynamical features of the networks.

We present here a theoretical investigation of the mechanism of these reactions in vitro under thermal conditions (dilute solutions of single-stranded chains, in the presence of molar concentrations of monovalent salts and at elevated temperatures). The mechanism follows a Kramers' process, whereby the complementary chains overcome a potential barrier through Brownian motion. The barrier originates from a single rate-limiting nucleation event in which the first complementary base pairs are formed. The reaction then proceeds through a fast growth of the double helix. For the DNA of bacteriophages T7, T4 and equationX174 as well as for Escherichia coli DNA, the bimolecular rate equation of the reaction increases as a power law of the average degree of polymerization equation of the reacting single- strands: equation. This relationship holds for equation with an experimentally determined exponent equation. The length dependence results from a thermodynamic excluded-volume effect. The reacting single-stranded chains are predicted to be in universal good solvent conditions, and the scaling law is determined by the relevant equilibrium monomer contact probability.

We have tried to explain the observed system level dynamical properties of these networks in terms of their underlying structure. Our studies of the system level dynamics of these large scale biological networks provide a different perspective on their functioning compared to that obtained from purely structural studies. Our study also leads to some new insights on features such as robustness, fragility and modularity of these large scale biological networks. We also shed light on how different networks inside the cell such as metabolic networks and genetic networks are interrelated to each other.",08,[],10

Using analogies between genes on chromosomes and one-dimensional gases, we constructed a statistical null model.

0804.0448,q-bio,"Models of reaction chemistry based on the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) have become a crucial tool for simulating complicated biological reaction networks due to their ability to handle extremely complicated reaction networks and to represent noise in small-scale chemistry. These methods can, however, become highly inefficient for stiff reaction systems, those in which different reaction channels operate on widely varying time scales. In this paper, we develop two methods for accelerating sampling in SSA models: an exact method and a scheme allowing for sampling accuracy up to any arbitrary error bound. Both methods depend on analysis of the eigenvalues of continuous time Markov model graphs that define the behavior of the SSA. We demonstrate these methods for the specific application of sampling breakage times for multiply-connected bond networks, a class of stiff system important to models of self-assembly processes. We show theoretically and empirically that our eigenvalue methods provide substantially reduced sampling times for a wide range of network breakage models. These techniques are also likely to have broad use in accelerating SSA models so as to apply them to systems and parameter ranges that are currently computationally intractable.",08,[],10

Specifically, we use a Brownian dynamics formulation of the dendritic nucleation model of actin-driven propulsion. We show that the model leads to a self-assembled network that exerts forces on a disk and pushes it with an average speed. This simulation approach is the first to observe a speed that varies non-monotonically with the concentration of branching proteins (Arp2/3), capping protein and depolymerization rate (ADF), in accord with experimental observations.

By a brief stability and bifurcation analysis, we arrive at the Hopf and Turing bifurcation surface and derive the symbolic conditions for Hopf and Turing bifurcation in the spatial domain. Based on the stability and bifurcation analysis, we obtain spiral pattern formation via numerical simulation. Additionally, we study the model with colored noise and external periodic forcing. From the numerical results, we know that noise or external periodic forcing can induce instability and enhance the oscillation of the species, and resonant response.

0811.4036,q-bio,"Increase in vascular permeability occurs under many physiological conditions and is central in diverse human pathologies. Thrombin is a pro-coagulant serine protease, which causes the local loss of endothelial barrier integrity thereby enabling the rapid extravasation of plasma proteins and the local formation of fibrin-containing clots. Available information suggests that thrombin induces endothelial permeability by promoting actomyosin contractility through the Rho/ROCK signaling pathway. Here we took advantage of pharmacological inhibitors, knockdown approaches, and the emerging knowledge on how permeability factors affect endothelial junctions to investigate in detail the mechanism underlying thrombin-induced endothelial permeability. We show that thrombin signals through PAR-1 and its coupled G proteins G(12/13) and G(11/q) to induce RhoA activation and intracellular calcium elevation, and that these events are interrelated. In turn, this leads to the stimulation of ROCK, which causes actin stress-fiber formation. However, this alone is not sufficient to account for thrombin-induced permeability. Instead, we found that protein kinase C-related kinase, a Rho-dependent S/T kinase, is activated in endothelial cells upon thrombin stimulation and that its expression is required for endothelial permeability and remodeling of cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell adhesions. Our results demonstrate that the signal initiated by thrombin bifurcates at the level of RhoA to promote changes in the cytoskeletal architecture through ROCK and the remodeling of focal adhesion components through PRK. Ultimately, both pathways converge to cause cell-cell junction disruption and provoke vascular leakage.",08,[],10

0802.1223,q-bio,"We have developed a mathematical model of regulation of expression of the Escherichia coli lac operon, and have investigated bistability in its steady-state induction behavior in the absence of external glucose. Numerical analysis of equations describing regulation by artificial inducers revealed two natural bistability parameters that can be used to control the range of inducer concentrations over which the model exhibits bistability. By tuning these bistability parameters, we found a family of biophysically reasonable systems that are consistent with an experimentally determined bistable region for induction by thio-methylgalactoside (Ozbudak et al. Nature 427:737, 2004). The model predicts that bistability can be abolished when passive transport or permease export becomes sufficiently large; the former case is especially relevant to induction by isopropyl-beta, D-thiogalactopyranoside. To model regulation by lactose, we developed similar equations in which allolactose, a metabolic intermediate in lactose metabolism and a natural inducer of lac, is the inducer. For biophysically reasonable parameter values, these equations yield no bistability in response to induction by lactose; however, systems with an unphysically small permease-dependent export effect can exhibit small amounts of bistability for limited ranges of parameter values. These results cast doubt on the relevance of bistability in the lac operon within the natural context of E. coli, and help shed light on the controversy among existing theoretical studies that address this issue. The results also suggest an experimental approach to address the relevance of bistability in the lac operon within the natural context of E. coli.",08,[],10
0806.2763,q-bio,"One approach to studying the system-wide organization of biochemistry is to use statistical graph theory. Even in such a heavily simplified method, which disregards most of the dynamic aspects of biochemistry, one is faced with fundamental questions, such as how the chemical reaction systems should be reduced to a graph retaining as much functional information as possible from the original reaction system. In such graph representations, should the edges go between substrates and products, or substrates and substrates, or both? Should vertices represent substances or reactions? Different definitions encode different information about the reaction system. In this paper we evaluate four different graph representations of metabolism, applied to data from different organisms and databases. The graph representations are evaluated by comparing the overlap between clusters (network modules) and annotated functions, and also by comparing the set of identified currency metabolites with those that other authors have identified using qualitative biological arguments. We find that a ""substance network,"" where all metabolites participating in a reaction are connected, is relatively better than others, evaluated both with respect to the functional overlap between modules and functions and to the number and identity of identified currency metabolites.",08,[],10
0807.4765,q-bio,"Unfolded proteins may contain native or non-native residual structure, which has important implications for the thermodynamics and kinetics of folding as well as for misfolding and aggregation diseases. However, it has been universally accepted that residual structure should not affect the global size scaling of the denatured chain, which obeys the statistics of random coil polymers. Here we use a single-molecule optical technique, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, to probe the denatured state of set of repeat proteins containing an increasing number of identical domains, from two to twenty. The availability of this set allows us to obtain the scaling law for the unfolded state of these proteins, which turns out to be unusually compact, strongly deviating from random-coil statistics. The origin of this unexpected behavior is traced to the presence of extensive non-native polyproline II helical structure, which we localize to specific segments of the polypeptide chain. We show that the experimentally observed effects of PPII on the size scaling of the denatured state can be well-described by simple polymer models. Our findings suggest an hitherto unforeseen potential of non-native structure to induce significant compaction of denatured proteins, affecting significantly folding pathways and kinetics.",08,[],10
0812.0191,q-bio,"[abridged] Background: The distribution of chemical species in an open system at metastable equilibrium can be expressed as a function of environmental variables which can include temperature, oxidation-reduction potential and others. Calculations of metastable equilibrium for various model systems were used to characterize chemical transformations among proteins and groups of proteins found in different compartments of yeast cells.   Results: With increasing oxygen fugacity, the relative metastability fields of model proteins for major subcellular compartments go as mitochondrion, endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasm, nucleus. In a metastable equilibrium setting at relatively high oxygen fugacity, proteins making up actin are predominant, but those constituting the microtubule occur with a low chemical activity. A reaction sequence involving the microtubule and spindle pole proteins was predicted by combining the known intercompartmental interactions with a hypothetical program of oxygen fugacity changes in the local environment. In further calculations, the most-abundant proteins within compartments generally occur in relative abundances that only weakly correspond to a metastable equilibrium distribution. However, physiological populations of proteins that form complexes often show an overall positive or negative correlation with the relative abundances of proteins in metastable assemblages.   Conclusions: This study explored the outlines of a thermodynamic description of chemical transformations among interacting proteins in yeast cells. The results suggest that these methods can be used to measure the degree of departure of a natural biochemical process or population from a local minimum in Gibbs energy.",08,[],10

0801.1296,q-bio,"During batch growth on mixtures of two growth-limiting substrates, microbes consume the substrates either sequentially or simultaneously. These growth patterns are manifested in all types of bacteria and yeasts. The ubiquity of these growth patterns suggests that they are driven by a universal mechanism common to all microbial species. In previous work, we showed that a minimal model accounting only for enzyme induction and dilution explains the phenotypes observed in batch cultures of various wild-type and mutant/recombinant cells. Here, we examine the extension of the minimal model to continuous cultures. We show that: (1) Several enzymatic trends, usually attributed to specific regulatory mechanisms such as catabolite repression, are completely accounted for by dilution. (2) The bifurcation diagram of the minimal model for continuous cultures, which classifies the substrate consumption pattern at any given dilution rate and feed concentrations, provides a a precise explanation for the empirically observed correlation between the growth patterns in batch and continuous cultures. (3) Numerical simulations of the model are in excellent agreement with the data. The model captures the variation of the steady state substrate concentrations, cell densities, and enzyme levels during the single- and mixed-substrate growth of bacteria and yeasts at various dilution rates and feed concentrations. (4) This variation is well-approximated by simple analytical expressions that furnish physical insights into the steady states of continuous cultures. The minimal model provides a framework for quantitating the effect of regulatory mechanisms. We illustrate this by analyzing several data sets from the literature.",08,[],10

This enables us to write down expressions for the sensitivity, short term specificity and long term specificity of a test for recent infection defined by a BED ODn below a threshold. We then derive an identity which shows the relationship between these parameters, allowing the elimination of sensitivity and short term specificity from an expression relating the proportion of ""true recent infections"" to the proportion of seropositive individuals testing below threshold. This has two important consequences. Firstly, the simplified formula is substantially more amenable to calibration.

0801.4301,q-bio,"The G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily is currently the largest class of therapeutic targets. \textitIn silico prediction of interactions between GPCRs and small molecules is therefore a crucial step in the drug discovery process, which remains a daunting task due to the difficulty to characterize the 3D structure of most GPCRs, and to the limited amount of known ligands for some members of the superfamily. Chemogenomics, which attempts to characterize interactions between all members of a target class and all small molecules simultaneously, has recently been proposed as an interesting alternative to traditional docking or ligand-based virtual screening strategies. We propose new methods for in silico chemogenomics and validate them on the virtual screening of GPCRs. The methods represent an extension of a recently proposed machine learning strategy, based on support vector machines (SVM), which provides a flexible framework to incorporate various information sources on the biological space of targets and on the chemical space of small molecules. We investigate the use of 2D and 3D descriptors for small molecules, and test a variety of descriptors for GPCRs. We show fo instance that incorporating information about the known hierarchical classification of the target family and about key residues in their inferred binding pockets significantly improves the prediction accuracy of our model. In particular we are able to predict ligands of orphan GPCRs with an estimated accuracy of 78.1%.",08,[],10
0804.4218,q-bio,"We present a simple analytical tool which gives an approximate insight into the stationary behavior of nonlinear systems undergoing the influence of a weak and rapid noise from one dominating source, e.g. the kinetic equations describing a genetic switch with the concentration of one substrate fluctuating around a constant mean. The proposed method allows for predicting the asymmetric response of the genetic switch to noise, arising from the noise-induced shift of stationary states. The method has been tested on an example model of the lac operon regulatory network: a reduced Yildirim-Mackey model with fluctuating extracellular lactose concentration. We calculate analytically the shift of the system's stationary states in the presence of noise. The results of the analytical calculation are in excellent agreement with the results of numerical simulation of the noisy system. The simulation results suggest that the structure of the kinetics of the underlying biochemical reactions protects the bistability of the lactose utilization mechanism from environmental fluctuations. We also show that, in the consequence of the noise-induced shift of stationary states, the presence of fluctuations stabilizes the behavior of the system in a selective way: although the extrinsic noise facilitates, to some extent, switching off the lactose metabolism, the same noise prevents it from switching on.",08,[],10

0808.0287,q-bio,"We compare three basic kinds of discrete mathematical models used to portray phylogenetic relationships among species and higher taxa: phylogenetic trees, Hennig trees and Nelson cladograms. All three models are trees, as that term is commonly used in mathematics; the difference between them lies in the biological interpretation of their vertices and edges. Phylogenetic trees and Hennig trees carry exactly the same information, and translation between these two kinds of trees can be accomplished by a simple algorithm. On the other hand, evolutionary concepts such as monophyly are represented as different mathematical substructures are represented differently in the two models. For each phylogenetic or Hennig tree, there is a Nelson cladogram carrying the same information, but the requirement that all taxa be represented by leaves necessarily makes the representation less efficient. Moreover, we claim that it is necessary to give some interpretation to the edges and internal vertices of a Nelson cladogram in order to make it useful as a biological model. One possibility is to interpret internal vertices as sets of characters and the edges as statements of inclusion; however, this interpretation carries little more than incomplete phenetic information. We assert that from the standpoint of phylogenetics, one is forced to regard each internal vertex of a Nelson cladogram as an actual (albeit unsampled) species simply to justify the use of synapomorphies rather than symplesiomorphies.",08,[],10
0806.0690,q-bio,"This paper extends our recently developed Life Space Foam (LSF) model of motivated cognitive dynamics \citeIA. LSF uses adaptive path integrals to generate Lewinian force--fields on smooth manifolds, in order to characterize the dynamics of individual goal--directed action. According to explanatory theories growing in acceptance in cognitive neuroscience, one of the key properties of this dynamics, capable of linking it to microscopic-level cortical neurodynamics, is its meta-stability and the resulting phase transitions. Our extended LSF model incorporates the notion of phase transitions and complements it with embedded geometrical chaos. To describe this LSF phase transition, a general path--integral is used, along the corresponding LSF topology change. As a result, our extended LSF model is able to rigorously represent co-action by two or more actors in the common LSF--manifold.

0801.3651,q-bio,"Self-organization of neural circuitry is an appealing framework for understanding cortical development, yet its applicability remains unconfirmed. Models for the self-organization of neural circuits have been proposed, but experimentally testable predictions of these models have been less clear. The visual cortex contains a large number of topological point defects, called pinwheels, which are detectable in experiments and therefore in principle well suited for testing predictions of self-organization empirically. Here, we analytically calculate the density of pinwheels predicted by a pattern formation model of visual cortical development. An important factor controlling the density of pinwheels in this model appears to be the presence of non-local long-range interactions, a property which distinguishes cortical circuits from many nonliving systems in which self-organization has been studied. We show that in the limit where the range of these interactions is infinite, the average pinwheel density converges to equation. Moreover, an average pinwheel density close to this value is robustly selected even for intermediate interaction ranges, a regime arguably covering interaction-ranges in a wide range of different species. In conclusion, our paper provides the first direct theoretical demonstration and analysis of pinwheel density selection in models of cortical self-organization and suggests to quantitatively probe this type of prediction in future high-precision experiments.",08,[],10

Our method relies on known elastic potentials and a careful choice of coordinates of the well-established rigid base-pair model of DNA. The results are robust with respect to parameter and conformation uncertainty. They reveal the complex nano-mechanical patterns of interaction between proteins and DNA.

0810.5676,q-bio,"The endemic pine, Pinus canariensis, forms one of the main forest ecosystems in the Canary Islands. In this archipelago, pine forest is a mosaic of natural stands (remnants of past forest overexploitation) and artificial stands planted from the 1940's. The genetic makeup of the artificially regenerated forest is of some concern. The use of reproductive material with uncontrolled origin or from a reduced number of parental trees may produce stands ill adapted to local conditions or unable to adapt in response to environmental change. The genetic diversity within a transect of reforested stands connecting two natural forest fragments has been studied with nuclear and chloroplast microsatellites. Little genetic differentiation and similar levels of genetic diversity to the surrounding natural stands were found for nuclear markers. However, chloroplast microsatellites presented lower haplotype diversity in reforested stands, and this may be a consequence of the lower effective population size of the chloroplast genome, meaning chloroplast markers have a higher sensitivity to bottlenecks. Understory natural regeneration within the reforestation was also analysed to study gene flow from natural forest into artificial stands. Estimates of immigration rate into artificially regenerated forest were high (0.68-0.75), producing a significant increase of genetic diversity (both in chloroplast and nuclear microsatellites), which indicates the capacity for genetic recovery for P. canariensis reforestations surrounded by larger natural stands.",08,[],10

We further assume that the per-mismatch SOS elimination rate is characterized by a first-order rate constant equation. For a single fitness peak landscape where the master genome can sustain up to equation mismatches and remain viable, this model is analytically solvable in the limit of infinite sequence length.

Using statistical analysis of these traced data, we found that cells showed complex dynamics with anomalous diffusion and that their velocity distribution had power-law tails in all conditions. Furthermore, as development proceeded, average velocity and persistency of the movement increased and as too did the exponential behavior in the velocity distribution.

0810.0053,q-bio,"Recent microbial experiments suggest that enhanced genetic drift at the frontier of a two-dimensional range expansion can cause genetic sectoring patterns with fractal domain boundaries. Here, we propose and analyze a simple model of asexual biological evolution at expanding frontiers to explain these neutral patterns and predict the effect of natural selection. Our model attributes the observed gradual decrease in the number of sectors at the leading edge to an unbiased random walk of sector boundaries. Natural selection introduces a deterministic bias in the wandering of domain boundaries that renders beneficial mutations more likely to escape genetic drift and become established in a sector. We find that the opening angle of those sectors and the rate at which they become established depend sensitively on the selective advantage of the mutants. Deleterious mutations, on the other hand, are not able to establish a sector permanently. They can, however, temporarily ""surf"" on the population front, and thereby reach unusual high frequencies. As a consequence, expanding frontiers are susceptible to deleterious mutations as revealed by the high fraction of mutants at mutation-selection balance. Numerically, we also determine the condition at which the wild type is lost in favor of deleterious mutants (genetic meltdown) at a growing front. Our prediction for this error threshold differs qualitatively from existing well-mixed theories, and sets tight constraints on sustainable mutation rates for populations that undergo frequent range expansions.",08,[],10

0812.2451,q-bio,"The protective effect exerted by polyamines (Put and Spd) against cadmium (Cd) stress was investigated in Brassica juncea plants. Treatment with CdCl2 (75 micro-Mole) resulted in a rise of Cd accumulation, a decrease of fresh and dry weights in every plant organ, an increase of free polyamine content at limb and stem levels as well as a decrease at root level. On the other hand, the total conjugated polyamine levels in the stem tissues were unaffected by Cd. In the leaf tissues, this metal caused a reduction of chlorophyll a content, a rise of guaiacol peroxidase (GPOX) activity and an increase of malondialdehyde (MDA), soluble glucide, proline and amino acid contents. Exogenous application, by spraying, of putrescine (Put) and spermidine (Spd) to leaf tissues reduced CdCl2-induced stress. These polyamines proved to exert a partial, though significant, protection of the foliar fresh weight and to alleviate the oxidative stress generated by Cd through reductions of MDA amounts and GPOX (E.C.1.11.1.7) activity. The enhancement of chlorophyll a content in plants by Put and those of Chl a and Chl b by Spd both constitute evidences of their efficacy against the Cd2-induced loss of pigments. Conversely to Put, Spd caused a decrease of Cd content in leave tissues and a rise in the stems and roots; these findings are in favour of a stimulation of Cd uptake by Spd.

In this regime, the momentum dynamics is subdiffusive, which also manifests itself in a non-Gaussian limiting distribution and a fractional power-law decay of the inverse participation ratio. The purity initially decays with a stretched exponential which is followed by two regimes of power-law decay with different exponents.

The uniform value in the chaotic sea is explained by the random state conjecture. As classically chaotic dynamics take localized distributions in phase space to random distributions, quantized versions take localized coherent states to pseudo-random states in Hilbert space. Such random states are highly entangled, with an average value near that of the maximally entangled state. For a map with global chaos, we derive that value based on new analytic results for the typical entanglement in a subspace defined by the symmetries of the system.

0811.4633,quant-ph,"It is well established that an entanglement encoded in the Bell states of a two-qubit system with correlated spins exhibits completely different evolution properties than that encoded in states with the anti-correlated spins. A complete and abrupt loss of the entanglement, called the entanglement sudden death, can be found to occur for the spin correlated states, but the entanglement evolves without any discontinuity or decays asymptotically for the spin anti-correlated states. We consider the evolution of an initial entanglement encoded in the spin anti-correlated states and demonstrate that the asymptotic behavior predicted before occurs only in the weak coupling limit or equivalently when the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is made on the interaction Hamiltonian of the qubits with the field. If we do not restrict ourselves to the RWA, we find that the entanglement undergoes a discontinuity, the sudden death phenomenon. We illustrate this behavior by employing an efficient scheme for entanglement evolution between two cold-trapped atoms located inside a single-mode cavity. Although only a single excitation is initially present in the system, we find that the two-photon excited state, which plays the key role for the discontinuity in the behavior of the entanglement, gains a population over a short time of the evolution. When the RWA is made on the interaction, the two-photon excited state remains unpopulated for all times and the discontinuity is absent. We attribute this phenomenon to the principle of complementarity between the evolution time and energy, and the presence of the counter-rotating terms in the interaction Hamiltonian.",08,[],6

We conclude the existence of direct correspondences between (i) the payoff rule and Bell inequalities, and (ii) the strategy and the choice of measured observables in evaluating these Bell inequalities. We also show that such a correspondence between Bell polynomials (in a single plane) and four-player, symmetric, binary-choice quantum games is unique to the four-player quantum Minority game and its ""anti-Minority"" version. This indicates that the four-player Minority game not only plays a special role among quantum games but also in studies of Bell-type quantum nonlocality.",08,[],6

This is demonstrated by analyzing the trajectories of the atoms under the influence of dressed magnetic potentials in the strong field regime. We investigate the problem of adiabaticity of the rf dressing process, and relate it to how close the dressed states are to degeneracy.

Here we analyze the extent to which the Schrodinger-Newton equation can be used as a model to generate a full, time dependent description of the quantum state reduction process. We find that when supplied with an imaginary gravitational potential, the Schrodinger-Newton equation offers a rationalisation for some of the hitherto unexplained characteristics of quantum state reduction.

By distinguishing between two mixed states, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a dishonest participant can attain all the information without introducing any error, which shows that the HBB protocol is insecure against dishonest participants. It is easy to verify that the attack scheme of Karlsson, Koashi, and Imoto [Phys. Rev. A 59, 162 (1999)] is a special example of our results.

The dependence of its anisotropy on the laser saturation is discussed in the resonant case, and the mapping of moments of the atom's center-of-mass motion due to the pumping is presented.

It is shown that the expected CR composition is characterised by two peaks in the energy dependence of the mean CR atomic number <A(letter)>. The first one at the energy letter \approx 1017 eV corresponds to the very end of the Galactic CR component, produced in supernova remnants (SNRs). It is followed by a sharp decrease of <A(letter)> within the energy interval from 1017 to 1018 eV. This is a signature of the transition from Galactic to extragalactic CRs. The second peak, with <ln A> \approx 2, at energy letter\approx 1019 eV, expected at the beginning of the GZK cutoff, is the signature of the CR production by the nonrelativistic cocoon shocks. The calculated CR composition is consistent with the existing data.

0901.0486,astro-ph,"We examine MHD simulations of the propagation of a strong shock wave through the interstellar two-phase medium composed of small-scale cloudlets and diffuse warm neutral medium in two-dimensional geometry. The pre-shock two-phase medium is provided as a natural consequence of the thermal instability that is expected to be ubiquitous in the interstellar medium. We show that the shock-compressed shell becomes turbulent owing to the preshock density inhomogeneity and magnetic field amplification takes place in the shell. The maximum field strength is determined by the condition that plasma beta ~ 1, which gives the field strength on the order of 1 mG in the case of shock velocity ~ 1,000 km/s. The strongly magnetized region shows filamentary and knot-like structures in two-dimensional simulations. The spatial scale of the regions with magnetic field of 1 mG in our simulation is roughly 0.05 pc which is comparable to the spatial scale of the X-ray hot spots recently discovered in supernova remnants where the magnetic field strength is indicated to be amplified up to the order of 1 mG.

0904.0674,astro-ph,"Mayall II = G1 is one of the most luminous globular clusters (GCs) in M31. Here, we determine its age and mass by comparing multicolor photometry with theoretical stellar population synthesis models. Based on far- and near-ultraviolet GALEX photometry, broad-band UBVRI, and infrared JHKs 2MASS data, we construct the most extensive spectral energy distribution of G1 to date, spanning the wavelength range from 1538 to 20,000 A. A quantitative comparison with a variety of simple stellar population (SSP) models yields a mean age that is consistent with G1 being among the oldest building blocks of M31 and having formed within ~1.7 Gyr after the Big Bang. Irrespective of the SSP model or stellar initial mass function adopted, the resulting mass estimates (of order equation) indicate that G1 is one of the most massive GCs in the Local Group. However, we speculate that the cluster's exceptionally high mass suggests that it may not be a genuine GC. We also derive that G1 may contain, on average, equation far-ultraviolet-bright, hot, extreme horizontal-branch stars, depending on the SSP model adopted.

0906.2407,astro-ph,"When our Sun was young it rotated much more rapidly than now. Observations of young, rapidly rotating stars indicate that many possess substantial magnetic activity and strong axisymmetric magnetic fields. We conduct simulations of dynamo action in rapidly rotating suns with the 3-D MHD anelastic spherical harmonic (ASH) code to explore the complex coupling between rotation, convection and magnetism. Here we study dynamo action realized in the bulk of the convection zone for two systems, rotating at three and five times the current solar rate. We find that substantial organized global-scale magnetic fields are achieved by dynamo action in these systems. Striking wreathes of magnetism are built in the midst of the convection zone, coexisting with the turbulent convection. This is a great surprise, for many solar dynamo theories have suggested that a tachocline of penetration and shear at the base of the convection zone is a crucial ingredient for organized dynamo action, whereas these simulations do not include such tachoclines. Some dynamos achieved in these rapidly rotating states build persistent global-scale fields which maintain amplitude and polarity for thousands of days. In the case at five times the solar rate, the dynamo can undergo cycles of activity, with fields varying in strength and even changing polarity. As the magnetic fields wax and wane in strength, the primary response in the convective flows involves the axisymmetric differential rotation, which begins to vary on similar time scales. Bands of relatively fast and slow fluid propagate toward the poles on time scales of roughly 500 days. In the Sun, similar patterns are observed in the poleward branch of the torsional oscillations, and these may represent a response to poleward propagating magnetic field deep below the solar surface.",09,[],1

We present predictions for the soft X-ray line emission from the WHIM using a subset of cosmological simulations from the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations (OWLS) project. We use the OWLS models to test the dependence of the predicted emission on a range of physical prescriptions, such as cosmology, gas cooling and feedback from star formation and accreting black holes. Provided that metal-line cooling is taken into account, the models give surprisingly similar results, indicating that the predictions are robust. Soft X-ray lines trace the hotter part of the WHIM (T>106 K). We find that the OVIII 18.97A is the strongest emission line, with a predicted maximum surface brightness of ~102 photon/s/cm2/sr, but a number of other lines are only slightly weaker. All lines show a strong correlation between the intensity of the observed flux and the density and metallicity of the gas responsible for the emission. On the other hand, the potentially detectable emission consistently corresponds to the temperature at which the emissivity of the electronic transition peaks. The emission traces neither the baryonic nor the metal mass. In particular, the emission that is potentially detectable with proposed missions, traces overdense (rho>102rhomean) and metal-rich (Z>0.1Zsun) gas in and around galaxies and groups.

A small positional velocity gradient across velocity channels is seen in these lines, suggesting the presence of a weak bipolar outflow in the envelope of IRC10420.

These shells represent two previous mass-loss episodes from IRC10420. We attempt to derive in self-consistent manner the physical conditions inside the envelope by modelling the dust properties, and the heating and cooling of molecular gas. We estimate a mass loss rate of equation9 10equation Mequation yrequation for shell I and 7 10equation Mequation yrequation for shell II. The gas temperature is found to be unusually high in IRC10420 in comparison with other oxygen-rich envelopes.

0903.4719,astro-ph,"We have used the GMOS instrument on the Gemini-South telescope to obtain spatially-resolved two-colour imaging and IFU spectroscopy of a sample of ten nearby EA galaxies. Surface brightness profiles measured using our imaging data show the isophotal profiles of our sample are generally r1/4-like, consistent with a sample dominated by early-type galaxies. This is further underscored by all galaxies having early-type morphological classifications, and showing a behaviour in the central velocity dispersion-absolute magnitude plane that is consistent with the Faber-Jackson relation, once the transitory brightening that occurs in the EA phase is corrected for. In addition, two-thirds of our sample shows clear evidence of either ongoing or recent tidal interactions/mergers. While all the galaxies in our sample have total integrated colours that are relatively blue, they show a diversity of colour gradients, possessing central core regions that are either redder, bluer, or indistinct in colour relative to their outer regions. Kinematically, the most striking property is the significant and unambiguous rotation that is seen in all our EA galaxies, with it being generally aligned close to the photometric major axis. This is contrary to the findings of Norton et al. 2001, who found little or no evidence for rotation in a very similar sample of nearby EA galaxies. We also clearly demonstrate that our EA galaxies are, in all but one case, consistent with being ""fast rotators"" (Emsellem et al. 2007). We argue that the combination of disturbed morphologies and significant rotation in these galaxies supports their production via gas-rich galaxy mergers and interactions.

The extra contribution to the standard galaxy power spectrum is suppressed by kc-2, where kc=c k/a H (k is the wavevector, a the expansion factor, and H=\dota/a), and is thus effectively limited to the few largest-scale modes and very difficult to detect; however, a correlation, \propto kc-1, is generated between the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier space density fields of two different types of galaxy, which would otherwise be zero, i.e., the cross-power spectrum has an imaginary part: Pab(k,letter)/P(k)=(bafletter2)(bbfletter2) -i(3letterm/2)(letter/kc)(ba-bb)\mathcalO(kc-2), where P(k) is the real-space mass-density power spectrum, bi are the galaxy biases, letter is the cosine of the angle between the wavevector and line of sight, and f=dlnD/dlna (D is the linear growth factor). The total signal-to-noise of measurements of this effect is not dominated by the largest scales -- it converges at k~0.05 h/Mpc. This gravitational redshift result is pedagogically interesting, but naive in that it is gauge dependent and there are other effects of similar form and size, related to the transformation between observable and proper coordinates. I include these effects, which add other contributions to the coefficient of letter/kc, and add a letter3/kc term, but don't qualitatively change the picture. The leading source of noise in the measurement is galaxy shot-noise, not sample variance, so developments that allow higher S/N surveys can make this measurement powerful, although it would otherwise be only marginally detectable in a JDEM-scale survey.",09,[],1
0907.1687,astro-ph,"We present the first measurement of the relationship between the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect signal and the mass of galaxy clusters that uses gravitational lensing to measure cluster mass, based on 14 X-ray luminous clusters at z~0.2 from the Local Cluster Substructure Survey. We measure the integrated Compton y-parameter, Y, and total projected mass of the clusters (MGL) within a projected clustercentric radius of 350 kpc, corresponding to mean overdensities of 4000-8000 relative to the critical density. We find self-similar scaling between MGL and Y, with a scatter in mass at fixed Y of 32%. This scatter exceeds that predicted from numerical cluster simulations, however, it is smaller than comparable measurements of the scatter in mass at fixed TX. We also find no evidence of segregation in Y between disturbed and undisturbed clusters, as had been seen with TX on the same physical scales. We compare our scaling relation to the Bonamente et al. relation based on mass measurements that assume hydrostatic equilibrium, finding no evidence for a hydrostatic mass bias in cluster cores (MGL = 0.98/-0.13 MHSE), consistent with both predictions from numerical simulations and lensing/X-ray-based measurements of mass-observable scaling relations at larger radii. Overall our results suggest that the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect may be less sensitive than X-ray observations to the details of cluster physics in cluster cores.",09,[],1
0902.1525,astro-ph,"We study the orbital evolution and accretion history of massive black hole (MBH) pairs in rotationally supported circumnuclear discs up to the point where MBHs form binary systems. Our simulations have high resolution in mass and space which, for the first time, makes it feasible to follow the orbital decay of a MBH either counter- or co-rotating with respect to the circumnuclear disc. We show that a moving MBH on an initially counter-rotating orbit experiences an ""orbital angular momentum flip"" due to the gas-dynamical friction, i.e., it starts to corotate with the disc before a MBH binary forms. We stress that this effect can only be captured in very high resolution simulations. Given the extremely large number of gas particles used, the dynamical range is sufficiently large to resolve the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton radii of individual MBHs. As a consequence, we are able to link the accretion processes to the orbital evolution of the MBH pairs. We predict that the accretion rate is significantly suppressed and extremely variable when the MBH is moving on a retrograde orbit. It is only after the orbital angular momentum flip has taken place that the secondary rapidly ""lights up"" at which point both MBHs can accrete near the Eddington rate for a few Myr. The separation of the double nucleus is expected to be around ~10 pc at this stage. We show that the accretion rate can be highly variable also when the MBH is co-rotating with the disc (albeit to a lesser extent) provided that its orbit is eccentric. Our results have significant consequences for the expected number of observable double AGNs at separations of <100 pc.",09,[],1

From 2004 up to the end of 2007, the spin-down rate averaged at a mean rate of ~dnu/dt=-4.8e-13 Hz s-1 until the torque reversal reported here. Since then it has been following a steady spin-up at a mean rate of ~dnu/dt= 4e-13 Hz s-1.

0901.0514,astro-ph,"Context: The HD and H2 molecules play important roles in the cooling of primordial and very metal-poor gas at high redshift. Aims: Grain surface and gas phase formation of HD and H2 is investigated to assess the importance of trace amounts of dust, 10-5-10-3 Zo, in the production of HD and H2. Methods: We consider carbonaceous and silicate grains and include both physisorption and chemisorption, tunneling, and realistic grain surface barriers. We find, for a collapsing gas cloud environment with coupled chemical and thermal balance, that dust abundances as small as 10-5 solar lead to a strong boost in the H2 formation rate due to surface reactions. As a result of this enhancement in H2, HD is formed more efficiently in the gas phase through the D  H2 reaction. Direct formation of HD on dust grains cannot compete well with this gas phase process for dust temperatures below 150 K. We also derive up-to-date analytic fitting formulae for the grain surface formation of H2 and HD, including the different binding energies of H and D. Results: Grain surface reactions are crucial to the availability of H2 and HD in very metal-poor environments. Above metallicities of 10-5 solar, the grain surface route dominates the formation of H2, which in turn, drives the formation of HD in the gas phase. At dust temperatures above 150 K, laboratory experiments and theoretical modelling suggest that H2 formation on grains is suppressed while HD formation on grains is not.",09,[],1
0911.2007,astro-ph,"We report on a broader evaluation of statistical bootstrap resampling methods as a tool for pixel-level calibration and imaging fidelity assessment in radio interferometry. Pixel-level imaging fidelity assessment is a challenging problem, important for the value it holds in robust scientific interpretation of interferometric images, enhancement of automated pipeline reduction systems needed to broaden the user community for these instruments, and understanding leadingedge direction-dependent calibration and imaging challenges for future telescopes such as the Square Kilometer Array. This new computational approach is now possible because of advances in statistical resampling for data with long-range dependence and the available performance of contemporary high-performance computing resources. We expand our earlier numerical evaluation to span a broader domain subset in simulated image fidelity and source brightness distribution morphologies. As before, we evaluate the statistical performance of the bootstrap resampling methods against direct Monte Carlo simulation. We find both model-based and subsample bootstrap methods to continue to show significant promise for the challenging problem of interferometric imaging fidelityassessment, when evaluated over the broader domain subset. We report on their measured statistical performance and guidelines for their use and application in practice. We also examine the performance of the underlying polarization self-calibration algorithm used in this study over a range of parallactic angle coverage.",09,[],1
0904.2446,astro-ph,"We present a simple numerical model of the plasma flow within the open field line tube in the pulsar magnetosphere. We study how the plasma screens the rotationally induced electric field and maintains the electric current demanded by the global structure of the magnetosphere. We show that even though bulk of the plasma moves outwards with relativistic velocities, a small fraction of particles is continuously redirected back forming reverse plasma flows. The density and composition (positrons or electrons, or both) of these reverse flows are determined by the distribution of the Goldreich-Julian charge density along the tube and by the global magnetospheric current. These reverse flows could significantly affect the process of the pair plasma production in the polar cap accelerator. Our simulations also show that formation of the reverse flows is accompanied by the generation of long wavelength plasma oscillations, which could be converted, via the induced scattering on the bulk plasma flow, into the observed radio emission.",09,[],1
0910.2543,astro-ph,"We present an analysis of NGC2204-S892 -- a new detached eclipsing binary composed of two late K dwarfs. Based on three photometric campaigns launched in 2008 we obtained 5 light curves (3 in V, 1 in B and 1 in I), and derived an orbital period of 0.451780-0.000001 d. We also obtained 20 VLT/UVES spectra, enabling accurate radial velocity measurements. The derived masses and radii of the components (m1 = 0.733 -0.005 Msun and R1 = 0.72 -0.01 Rsun; m2 = 0.662 -0.005 Msun and R2 = 0.68 \-0.02 Rsun) are consistent with the empirical mass-radius relationship established recently for lower main sequence stars in binary systems; in particular we find that both stars are oversized compared to theoretical models. NGC2204-S892 is very active: both components show variable emission in Halpha and Hbeta and are heavily spotted, causing the light curve to show appreciable changes on a timescale of weeks. Our results add to the increasing evidence that the observed inflation of the radii of K and M stars is related to high levels of magnetic activity.",09,[],1
0903.2139,astro-ph,"We present high-precision photometry of two transit events of the extrasolar planetary system WASP-5, obtained with the Danish 1.54m telescope at ESO La Silla. In order to minimise both random and flat-fielding errors, we defocussed the telescope so its point spread function approximated an annulus of diameter 40 pixels (16 arcsec). Data reduction was undertaken using standard aperture photometry plus an algorithm for optimally combining the ensemble of comparison stars. The resulting light curves have point-to-point scatters of 0.50 mmag for the first transit and 0.59 mmag for the second. We construct detailed signal to noise calculations for defocussed photometry, and apply them to our observations. We model the light curves with the JKTEBOP code and combine the results with tabulated predictions from theoretical stellar evolutionary models to derive the physical properties of the WASP-5 system. We find that the planet has a mass of Mb = 1.637 /- 0.075 /- 0.033 Mjup, a radius of Rb = 1.171 /- 0.056 /- 0.012 Rjup, a large surface gravity of gb = 29.6 /- 2.8 m/s2 and a density of rhob = 1.02 /- 0.14 /- 0.01 rhojup (statistical and systematic uncertainties).

0911.4019,astro-ph,"The planetary nebula TS 01 (also called PN G 135.955.9 or SBS 1150599A), with its record-holding low oxygen abundance and its double degenerate close binary core (period 3.9 h), is an exceptional object located in the Galactic halo. We have secured observational data in a complete wavelength range in order to pin down the abundances of half a dozen elements in the nebula. The abundances are obtained via detailed photoionization modelling taking into account all the observational constraints (including geometry and aperture effects) using the pseudo-3D photoionization code Cloudy3D. The spectral energy distribution of the ionizing radiation is taken from appropriate model atmospheres. Both stellar components contribute to the ionization: the 'cool' one provides the bulk of hydrogen ionization, and the 'hot' one is responsible for the presence of the most highly charged ions, which explains why previous attempts to model the nebula experienced difficulties. The nebular abundances of C, N, O, and Ne are found to be respectively, 1/3.5, 1/4.2, 1/70, and 1/11 of the Solar value, with uncertainties of a factor 2. Thus the extreme O deficiency of this object is confirmed. The abundances of S and Ar are less than 1/30 of Solar. Standard models of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis cannot explain the abundance pattern observed in the nebula. To obtain an extreme oxygen deficiency in a star whose progenitor has an initial mass of about 1 msun requires an additional mixing process, which can be induced by stellar rotation and/or by the presence of the close companion. We have computed a stellar model with initial mass of 1 msun, appropriate metallicity, and initial rotation of 100 kms, and find that rotation greatly improves the agreement between the predicted and observed abundances.",09,[],1

0902.4489,astro-ph,"This paper presents a study of the specific merger rate as a function of group membership, local environment, and redshift in a very large, equation, cosmological N-body simulation, the \textitMillennium Simulation. The goal is to provide environmental diagnostics of major merger populations in order to test simulations against observations and provide further constraints on major merger driven galaxy evolution scenarios. A halo sample is defined using the maximum circular velocity, which is both well defined for subhalos and closely correlated with galaxy luminosity. Subhalos, including the precursors of major mergers, are severely tidally stripped. Major mergers between subhalos are therefore extremely rare. Tidal stripping also suppresses dynamical friction, resulting in long major merger time scales when the more massive halo does not host other subhalos. In contrast, when other subhalos are present major merger time scales are several times shorter. This enhancement is likely due to inelastic unbound collisions between subhalos. Following these results, we predict that major mergers in group environments are dominated by mergers involving the central galaxy, that the specific merger rate is suppressed in groups, and that the frequency of fainter companions is enhanced for mergers and their remnants. We also observe an `assembly bias' in the major merger rate in that mergers of galaxy-like halos are slightly suppressed in overdense environments while mergers of group-like halos are slightly enhanced. A dynamical explanation for this trend is advanced which calls on both tidal effects and interactions between bound halos beyond the virial radii of locally dynamically dominant halos.",09,[],1
0906.1654,astro-ph,"Clusters, filaments, sheets and voids are the building blocks of the cosmic web. In this study, we present and compare two distinct algorithms for finding cosmic filaments and sheets, a task which is far less well established than the identification of dark matter halos or voids. One method is based on the smoothed dark matter density field, the other uses the halo distributions directly. We apply both techniques to one high resolution N-body simulation and reconstruct the filamentary/sheet like network of the dark matter density field. We focus on investigating the properties of the dark matter halos inside these structures, in particular on the directions of their spins and the orientation of their shapes with respect to the directions of the filaments and sheets. We find that both the spin and the major axes of filament-halos with masses <= 1013 Msun/h are preferentially aligned with the direction of the filaments. The spins and major axes of halos in sheets tend to lie parallel to the sheets. There is an opposite mass dependence of the alignment strengths for the spin (negative) and major (positive) axes, i.e. with increasing halo mass the major axis tends to be more strongly aligned with the direction of the filament whereas the alignment between halo spin and filament becomes weaker with increasing halo mass. The alignment strengths as a function of distance to the most massive node halo indicate that there is a transit large scale environment impact: from the 2-D collapse phase of the filament to the 3-D collapse phase of the cluster/node halo at small separation. Overall, the two algorithms for filament/sheet identification investigated here agree well with each other. The method based on halos alone can be easily adapted for use with observational data sets.",09,[],1
0912.4730,astro-ph,"This is the second paper of a series reporting the results from the PopStar evolutionary synthesis models. Here we present synthetic emission line spectra of H\sc ii regions photoionized by young star clusters, for seven values of cluster masses and for ages between 0.1 and 5.2 Myr. The ionizing Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) are those obtained by the PopStar code \citep*mgb09 for six different metallicities, with a very low metallicity set, Z=0.0001, not included in previous similar works. We assume that the radius of the H\sc ii region is the distance at which the ionized gas is deposited by the action of the mechanical energy of the winds and supernovae from the central ionizing young cluster. In this way the ionization parameter is eliminated as free argument, since now its value is obtained from the cluster physical properties (mass, age and metallicity) and from the gaseous medium characteristics (density and abundances). We discuss our results and compare them with those from previous models and also with a large and data set of giant H\sc ii regions for which abundances have been derived in a homogeneous manner. The values of the [OIII] lines (at equation 4363, 4959, 5007\AA) in the lowest metallicity nebulae are found to be very weak and similar to those coming from very high metallicity regions (solar or over-solar). Thus, the sole use of the oxygen lines is not enough to distinguish between very low and very high metallicity regions. In these cases we emphasize the need of the additional support of alternative metallicity tracers, like the [SIII] lines in the near-\textitIR.",09,[],1

Using Seyfert 1s, we calibrate [O IV] as a measure of AGN intrinsic luminosity, for particular use in high-obscuration environments. With this calibration, we measure the average decrement in 14-195 keV X-ray to [O IV] luminosity ratio for Seyfert 2s compared to type 1s. We find a decrement of 3.1 - 0.8 for Seyfert 2s, and a decrement of 5.0 - 2.7 for known Compton-thick Seyfert 2s. These decrements imply column densities of approximately log N(H)=24.6 and 24.7 cm-2, respectively. Thus, we infer that the average Seyfert 2 is more highly obscured and intrinsically more luminous than would be inferred even from the very hard X-rays. We demonstrate two applications of the hard X-ray to [O IV] ratio. We measure a column density for the extremely obscured NGC 1068 of log N(H)=25.3-25.4 cm-2.

0911.1337,astro-ph,"Planets have been observed in tight binary systems with separations less than 20 AU. A likely formation scenario for such systems involves a dynamical capture, after which high relative inclinations are likely and may lead to Kozai oscillations.   We numerically investigate the fate of an initially coplanar double-planet system in a class of binaries with separation ranging between equation AU. Dynamical integrations of representative four-body systems are performed, each including a hot Jupiter and a second planet on a wider orbit. We find that, although such systems can remain stable at low relative inclinations (equation), high relative inclinations are likely to lead to instabilities. This can be avoided if the planets are placed in a \emphKozai-stable zone within which mutual gravitational perturbations can suppress the Kozai mechanism.   We investigate the possibility of inducing Kozai oscillations in the inner orbit by a weak coupling mechanism between the planets in which the coplanarity is broken due to a differential nodal precession. Propagating perturbations from the stellar companion through a planetary system in this manner can have dramatic effects on the dynamical evolution of planetary systems, especially in tight binaries and can offer a reasonable explanation for eccentricity trends among planets observed in binary systems. We find that inducing such oscillations into the orbit of a hot Jupiter is more likely in tight binaries and an upper limit can be set on the binary separation above which these oscillations are not observed.",09,[],1

They have been combined with the deepest HST/ACS, Spitzer (MIPS and IRAC) and VLT/FORS2 ever achieved observations. Most intermediate redshift galaxies show anomalous velocity fields: 6 Gyrs ago, half of the present day spirals were out of equilibrium and had peculiar morphologies. The wealth of the data in these fields allow us to modelize the physical processes in each galaxy with an accuracy almost similar to what is done in the local Universe. These detailed analyses reveal the importance of merger processes, including their remnant phases.

0909.3953,astro-ph,"The nature of compact groups (CGs) of galaxies, apparently so dense that the galaxies often overlap, is still a subject of debate: Are CGs roughly as dense in 3D as they appear in projection?

The nature of CGs is re-appraised using the z=0 outputs of three galaxy formation models, applied to the dissipationless Millennium Simulation. The same selection criteria are applied to mock galaxy catalogs from these models as have been applied by Hickson and co-workers in redshift space. We find 20 times as many mock CGs as the `HCGs' found by Hickson within a distance corresponding to 9000 km/s. This very low (5%) HCG completeness is caused by Hickson missing groups that were either faint, near the surface brightness threshold, of small angular size, or with a dominant brightest galaxy. We find that most velocity-filtered CGs are physically dense, regardless of the precise threshold used in 3D group size and line-of-sight elongation, and of the galaxy formation model used. This result also holds for mock CGs with the same selection biases as was found for the HCGs.",09,[],1

The RVs were computed using our novel iodine cell technique for double-line binary stars. The precision of the RVs is of the order of 1-10 m/s. Our RVs combined with the archival visibility measurements from the Palomar Testbed Interferometer allow us to derive very precise spectroscopic/astrometric orbital and physical parameters of the binaries. In particular, we derive the masses, the absolute K and H band magnitudes and the parallaxes. The masses together with the absolute magnitudes in the K and H bands enable us to estimate the ages of the binaries.   These RVs allow us to obtain some of the most accurate mass determinations of binary stars. The fractional accuracy in m*sin(i) only and hence based on the RVs alone ranges from 0.02% to 0.42%. When combined with the PTI astrometry, the fractional accuracy in the masses ranges in the three best cases from 0.06% to 0.5%.

Imaging performance of UVIT would depend on several factors in addition to the optics, e.g. resolution of the detectors, Satellite Drift and Jitter, image frame acquisition rate, sky background, source intensity etc. The use of intensified CMOS-imager based photon counting detectors in UVIT put their own complexity over reconstruction of the images. All these factors could lead to several systematic effects in the reconstructed images. A study has been done through numerical simulations with artificial point sources and archival image of a galaxy from GALEX data archive, to explore the effects of all the above mentioned parameters on the reconstructed images. In particular the issues of angular resolution, photometric accuracy and photometric-nonlinearity associated with the intensified CMOS-imager based photon counting detectors have been investigated. The photon events in image frames are detected by three different centroid algorithms with some energy thresholds. Our results show that in presence of bright sources, reconstructed images from UVIT would suffer from photometric distortion in a complex way and the presence of overlapping photon events could lead to complex patterns near the bright sources. Further the angular resolution, photometric accuracy and distortion would depend on the values of various thresholds chosen to detect photon events.",09,[],1

We model the Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) employing a revised version of the Bruzual and Charlot synthesis population code that incorporates a new treatment of the TP--AGB phase (CB07). Our primary aim is to investigate the impact of the AGB phase in the stellar masses of the LBGs, and compare our new results with previous stellar mass estimates. Based on the new CB07 code we find that the stellar masses of LBGs are smaller on average by a factor of ~1.4 compared to previous estimates. LBGs with 8um and/or 24um detections show higher masses (M~1011 Mo) than LBGs faint in the IRAC bands (M~109 Mo). The ages of these massive LBGs are considerably higher than the rest of the population, indicating that they have been star-forming for at least ~1 Gyr. We also show how the addition of the IRAC bands, improves the accuracy of the estimated stellar masses and reduced the scatter on the derived M/L ratios. In particular, we present a tight correlation between the 8um IRAC band (rest-frame K for galaxies at z~3) and the stellar mass. We calculate the number density of massive (M > 1011 Mo) LBGs and find it to be equation= (1.12 equation 0.4) x 10(-5) Mpc(-3), ~1.5 times lower than that found by previous studies. Finally, based on UV-corrected SFRs we investigate the SFR-stellar mass correlation at z~3, find it similar to the one observed at other redshifts and show that our data place the peak of the evolution of the specific star formation rate at z~3.",09,[],1
0909.0146,astro-ph,"An evolution of the electron distribution function in the beam-plasma system with the return current is computed numerically for different parameters. The X-ray bremsstrahlung corresponding to such an electron distribution is calculated and the directivity of the X-ray emission is studied. For computations of the electron distribution functions we used a 3-D particle-in-cell electromagnetic code. The directivity of the X-ray emission was calculated using the angle-dependent electron-ion bremsstrahlung cross-section. It was found that the resulting electron distribution function depends on the magnetic field assumed along the electron beam propagation direction. For small magnetic fields the electron distribution function becomes broad in the direction perpendicular to the beam propagation due to the Weibel instability and the return current is formed by the electrons in a broad and shifted bulk of the distribution. On the other hand, for stronger magnetic fields the distribution is more extended in the beam-propagation direction and the return current is formed by the electrons in the extended distribution tail. In all cases, the anisotropy of the electron distribution decreases rapidly due to fast collisionless processes. However, the magnetic field reduces this anisotropy decrease. The X-ray directivity shows the same trend and it is always closer to the isotropic case than that in a simple beaming model.",09,[],1
0909.1990,astro-ph,"It is believed that eta Carinae is actually a massive binary system, with the wind-wind interaction responsible for the strong X-ray emission. Although the overall shape of the X-ray light curve can be explained by the high eccentricity of the binary orbit, other features like the asymmetry near periastron passage and the short quasi-periodic oscillations seen at those epochs, have not yet been accounted for. In this paper we explain these features assuming that the rotation axis of eta Carinae is not perpendicular to the orbital plane of the binary system. As a consequence, the companion star will face eta Carinae on the orbital plane at different latitudes for different orbital phases and, since both the mass loss rate and the wind velocity are latitude dependent, they would produce the observed asymmetries in the X-ray flux. We were able to reproduce the main features of the X-ray light curve assuming that the rotation axis of eta Carinae forms an angle of 29 degrees with the axis of the binary orbit. We also explained the short quasi-periodic oscillations by assuming nutation of the rotation axis, with amplitude of about 5 degrees and period of about 22 days. The nutation parameters, as well as the precession of the apsis, with a period of about 274 years, are consistent with what is expected from the torques induced by the companion star.",09,[],1

0908.3857,astro-ph,"Simulated maps of the HI distribution in the post-reionization era are used to study the prospects for detection with existing and upcoming radio telescopes. We consider detection in the redshifted radiation from the hyperfine transition with a rest frame frequency of 1420 MHz. Possibility of a statistical detection using visibility correlations is discussed. We show that the MWA (Murchison Widefield Array) and the GMRT (Giant   Meterwave Radio Telescope) can potentially detect signal from the HI distribution at high redshifts. MWA can detect visibility correlations at large angular scales at all redshifts accessible to it in the post-reionization era. The GMRT can detect visibility correlations at lower redshifts, specifically there is a strong case for a survey at z = 1.3. We also discuss prospects for direct detection of rare peaks in the HI distribution using the GMRT. We show that direct detection should be possible with integration time that is comparable to, or even less than, the time required for a statistical detection. Specifically, it is possible to make a statistical detection of the HI distribution by measuring the visibility correlation, and, direct detection of rare peaks in the HI distribution using the GMRT in less than 1000 hours of observations.",09,[],1
0901.3149,astro-ph,"We present predictions for galactic halo baryon fractions from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with a well-constrained model for galactic outflows. Without outflows, halos contain roughly the cosmic fraction of baryons, slightly lowered at high masses owing to pressure support from hot gas. The star formation efficiency is large and increases monotonically to low masses, in disagreement with data. With outflows, the baryon fraction is increasingly suppressed in halos to lower masses. A Milky Way-sized halo at z=0 has about 60% of the cosmic fraction of baryons, so ""missing"" halo baryons have largely been evacuated, rather than existing in some hidden form. Large halos (>1013 Mo) contain 85% of their cosmic share of baryons, which explains the mild missing baryon problem seen in clusters. By comparing results at z=3 and z=0, we show that most of the baryon removal occurs at early epochs in larger halos, while smaller halos lose baryons more recently. Star formation efficiency is maximized in halos of ~1013 Mo, dropping significantly to lower masses, which helps reconcile the sub-L* slope of the observed stellar and halo mass functions. These trends are predominantly driven by differential wind recycling, namely, that wind material takes longer to return to low-mass galaxies than high-mass galaxies. The hot gas content of halos is mostly unaffected by outflows, showing that outflows tend to blow holes and escape rather than deposit their energy into halo gas.",09,[],1

0908.2950,astro-ph,"We present a photometric study of the neglected open cluster Berkeley 53. We derived its fundamental parameters, such as the age, the interstellar reddening, and the distance from the Sun, based on BV photometry combined with near-infrared JHK data. The structure and the mass function of the cluster were also studied and the total number of members and the total mass were estimated. The cluster was found to be a rich and massive stellar system, located in the Perseus Arm of the Milky Way, 3.1/-0.1 kpc from the Sun. Its age exceeds 1 Gy but it seems to be very young in the context of its dynamical evolution. The analysis of the two-color diagrams and color-magnitude diagrams indicates that the cluster is significantly reddened. However, both methods resulted in different values of E(B-V), i.e. 1.21/-0.04 and 1.52/-0.01, respectively. This discrepancy suggests the presence of an abnormal interstellar extinction law toward the cluster.",09,[],1
0907.1236,astro-ph,"We present a 5-8 micron analysis of the Spitzer-IRS spectra of 71 ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with redshift z < 0.15, devoted to the study of the role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and starbursts (SB) as the power source of the extreme infrared emission. Around 5 micron an AGN is much brighter (by a factor 30) than a starburst of equal bolometric luminosity. This allows us to detect the presence of even faint accretion-driven cores inside ULIRGs: signatures of AGN activity are found in 70 per cent of our sample (50/71 sources). Through a simple analytical model we are also able to obtain a quantitative estimate of the AGN/SB contribution to the overall energy output of each source. Although the main fraction of ULIRG luminosity is confirmed to arise from star formation events, the AGN contribution is non-negligible (23 per cent) and is shown to increase with luminosity. The existence of a rather heterogeneous pattern in the composition and geometrical structure of the dust among ULIRGs is newly supported by the comparison between individual absorption features and continuum extinction.",09,[],1
0907.3004,astro-ph,"In this paper we present the results of a study of the spatial distribution and asymmetry of solar active prominences (SAP) for the period 1996-2007 (solar cycle 23). For more meaningful statistical analysis we have analysed the distribution and asymmetry of SAP in two subdivisions viz. Group1 (ADF, APR, DSF, CRN, CAP) and Group2 (AFS, ASR, BSD, BSL, DSD, SPY, LPS). The north-south (N-S) latitudinal distribution shows that the SAP events are most prolific in the 21-30degree slice in the northern and southern hemispheres and east-west (E-W) longitudinal distribution study shows that the SAP events are most prolific (best visible) in the 81-90degree slice in the eastern and western hemispheres. It has been found that the SAP activity during this cycle is low compared to previous solar cycles. The present study indicates that during the rising phase of the cycle the number of SAP events were roughly equal on the north and south hemispheres. However, activity on the southern hemisphere has been dominant since 1999. Our statistical study shows that the N-S asymmetry is more significant then the E-W asymmetry.",09,[],1

0910.5901,astro-ph,"We have used archival HST Hequation images to study the immediate environments of massive and intermediate-mass young stellar object (YSO) candidates in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The sample of YSO candidates, taken from Gruendl & Chu (2009), was selected based on Spitzer IRAC and MIPS observations of the entire LMC and complementary ground-based optical and near-infrared observations. We found HST Hequation images for 99 YSO candidates in the LMC, of which 82 appear to be genuine YSOs. More than 95% of the YSOs are found to be associated with molecular clouds. YSOs are seen in three different kinds of environments in the Hequation images: in dark clouds, inside or on the tip of bright-rimmed dust pillars, and in small H II regions. Comparisons of spectral energy distributions for YSOs in these three different kinds of environments suggest that YSOs in dark clouds are the youngest, YSOs with small H II regions are the most evolved, and YSOs in bright-rimmed dust pillars span a range of intermediate evolutionary stages. This rough evolutionary sequence is substantiated by the presence of silicate absorption features in the Spitzer IRS spectra of some YSOs in dark clouds and in bright-rimmed dust pillars, but not those of YSOs in small H II regions. We present a discussion on triggered star formation for YSOs in bright-rimmed dust pillars or in dark clouds adjacent to H II regions. As many as 50% of the YSOs are resolved into multiple sources in high-resolution HST images. This illustrates the importance of using high-resolution images to probe the true nature and physical properties of YSOs in the LMC.",09,[],1

0912.4830,astro-ph,"The Saturnian coorbital satellites Janus and Epimetheus present a unique dynamical configuration in the Solar System, because of high-amplitude horseshoe orbits, due to a mass ratio of order unity. As a consequence, they swap their orbits every 4 years, while their orbital periods is about 0.695 days. Recently, Tiscareno et al.(2009) got observational informations on the shapes and the rotational states of these satellites. In particular, they detected an offset in the expected equilibrium position of Janus, and a large libration of Epimetheus. We here propose to give a 3-dimensional theory of the rotation of these satellites in using these observed data, and to compare it to the observed rotations. We consider the two satellites as triaxial rigid bodies, and we perform numerical integrations of the system in assuming the free librations as damped. The periods of the three free librations we get, associated with the 3 dimensions, are respectively 1.267, 2.179 and 2.098 days for Janus, and 0.747, 1.804 and 5.542 days for Epimetheus. The proximity of 0.747 days to the orbital period causes a high sensitivity of the librations of Epimetheus to the moments of inertia. Our theory explains the amplitude of the librations of Janus and the error bars of the librations of Epimetheus, but not an observed offset in the orientation of Janus.",09,[],1

We suppose that this emission is generated by accretion processes onto the central supermassive blackhole when an unbounded part of captured stars obtains an additional momentum. As a result a flux of subrelativistic protons is generated near the Galactic center which heats the background plasma up to temperatures about 6-10 keV and produces by inverse bremsstrahlung a flux of non-thermal X-ray emission in the energy range above 10 keV.,09,[],1

0912.3582,astro-ph,"Recent observations in X-ray and Gamma-ray suggest that the emission region of the pulsar magnetosphere can be multifold. In particular, the open-close boundary of the magnetic field, so-called the Y-point, can be the new candidate place where magnetic field energy converts into the plasma heat and/or flow energy. Here, we present a new Particle-in-Cell code, which can be applied to the Y-point of the pulsar magnetosphere in axisymmetric geometry. The electromagnetic solver is used in the two-dimensional grid points with the cylindrical coordinate (R, z), while the particle solver operates in the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate (x, y, z), where the Buneman-Boris method is used. The particle motion is treated in special relativity. The inner boundary conditions are set up to generate rotation of the magnetosphere by use of the force-free semi-analytic solution given by Uzdensky (2003, ApJ, 598, 446).   The code has been verified by dispersion relations of all the wave modes in electron-positron plasmas.   The initial test run is also presented to demonstrate the Y-shaped structure at the top of the dead zone on the light cylinder. We suggest that the structure is variable with quasi-periodicity associated with magnetic reconnection and that plasma will be accelerated and/or heated. In a time-averaged point of view, break up of the ideal-MHD condition takes place in the vicinity of the Y-point.",09,[],1
0906.5166,astro-ph,"New statistical properties of dark matter halos in Lagrangian space are presented. Tracing back the dark matter particles constituting bound halos resolved in a series of N-body simulations, we measure quantitatively the correlations of the proto-halo's inertia tensors with the local tidal tensors and investigate how the correlation strength depends on the proto-halo's sphericity, local density and filtering scale. It is shown that the majority of the proto-halos exhibit strong correlations between the two tensors provided that the tidal field is smoothed on the proto-halo's mass scale. The correlation strength is found to increase as the proto-halo's sphericity increases, as the proto-halo's mass increases, and as the local density becomes close to the critical value, deltaec. It is also found that those peculiar proto-halos which exhibit exceptionally weak correlations between the two tensors tend to acquire higher specific angular momentum in Eulerian space, which is consistent with the linear tidal torque theory. In the light of our results, it is intriguing to speculate a hypothesis that the low surface brightness galaxies observed at present epoch correspond to the peculiar proto-halos with extreme low-sphericity whose inertia tensors are weakly correlated with the local tidal tensors.",09,[],1
0906.5434,astro-ph,"The Sun's corona is millions of degrees hotter than its 5,000 K photosphere. This heating enigma is typically addressed by invoking the deposition at coronal heights of non-thermal energy generated by the interplay between convection and magnetic field near the photosphere. However, it remains unclear how and where coronal heating occurs and how the corona is filled with hot plasma. We show that energy deposition at coronal heights cannot be the only source of coronal heating, by revealing a significant coronal mass supply mechanism that is driven from below, in the chromosphere. We quantify the asymmetry of spectral lines observed with Hinode and SOHO and identify faint but ubiquitous upflows with velocities that are similar (50-100 km/s) across a wide range of magnetic field configurations and for temperatures from 100,000 to several million degrees. These upflows are spatio-temporally correlated with and have similar upward velocities as recently discovered, cool (10,000 K) chromospheric jets or (type II) spicules. We find these upflows to be pervasive and universal. Order of magnitude estimates constrained by conservation of mass and observed emission measures indicate that the mass supplied by these spicules can play a significant role in supplying the corona with hot plasma. The properties of these events are incompatible with coronal loop models that only include nanoflares at coronal heights. Our results suggest that a significant part of the heating and energizing of the corona occurs at chromospheric heights, in association with chromospheric jets.",09,[],1
0906.2310,astro-ph,"The Orion Bar is one of the nearest and best-studied photodissociation or photon-dominated regions (PDRs). Observations reveal the presence of H2 lines from vibrationally or rotationally excited upper levels that suggest warm gas temperatures (400 to 700 K). However, standard models of PDRs are unable to reproduce such warm rotational temperatures. In this paper we attempt to explain these observations with new comprehensive models which extend from the H region through the Bar and include the magnetic field in the equation of state. We adopt the model parameters from our previous paper which successfully reproduced a wide variety of spectral observations across the Bar. In this model the local cosmic-ray density is enhanced above the galactic background, as is the magnetic field, and which increases the cosmic-ray heating elevating the temperature in the molecular region. The pressure is further enhanced above the gas pressure in the H region by the momentum transferred from the absorbed starlight. Here we investigate whether the observed H2 lines can be reproduced with standard assumptions concerning the grain photoelectric emission. We also explore the effects due to the inclusion of recently computed H2  H2, H2  H and H2  He collisional rate coefficients.",09,[],1

All of them are heavily obscured, with E(B-V) ranging between 3 and 5, implying visual extinctions of ~ 9 to 15 magnitudes. We refine the published classifications of IGR J18027-2016 and IGR J191400951 by constraining their luminosity class. In the first case, we confirm the supergiant nature and rule out class III. In the second case, we propose a slightly higher luminosity class (Ia instead of Iab) and give an improved value of the distance based on new optical photometry.

We are consequently able to modify Gordon's optical metric to account for electromagnetic properties of ponderable material whose properties include both refraction and absorption. Unlike refraction alone however, including absorption requires a modification of the optical metric that depends on the eikonal of the wave itself. We derive the distance-redshift relation from the modified optical metric for Friedman-Lema\itre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes whose cosmic fluid has associated refraction and absorption coefficients.

0911.0311,astro-ph,"By constructing a global model based on 3D local magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations, we show that the disk wind driven by magnetorotational instability (MRI) plays a significant role in the dispersal of the gas component of proto-planetary disks. Because the mass loss time scale by the MRI-driven disk winds is proportional to the local Keplerian rotation period, a gas disk dynamically evaporates from the inner region with possibly creating a gradually expanding inner hole, while a sizable amount of the gas remains in the outer region. The disk wind is highly time-dependent with quasi-periodicity of several times Keplerian rotation period at each radius, which will be observed as time-variability of protostar-protoplanetary disk systems. These features persistently hold even if a dead zone exists because the disk winds are driven from the surface regions where ionizing cosmic rays and high energy photons can penetrate. Moreover, the predicted inside-out clearing significantly suppresses the infall of boulders to a central star and the Type I migration of proto-planets which are favorable for the formation and survival of planets.",09,[],1

0906.3157,astro-ph,"We report the results from a deep HST NICMOS H-band imaging survey of 28 z < 0.3 QSOs from the Palomar-Green (PG) sample. This program is part of QUEST (Quasar / ULIRG Evolution STudy) and complements a similar set of data on 26 highly-nucleated ULIRGs presented in Paper I. Our analysis indicates that the fraction of QSOs with elliptical hosts is higher among QSOs with undetected far-infrared (FIR) emission, small infrared excess, and luminous hosts. The hosts of FIR-faint QSOs show a tendency to have less pronounced merger-induced morphological anomalies and larger QSO-to-host luminosity ratios on average than the hosts of FIR-bright QSOs, consistent with late-merger evolution from FIR-bright to FIR-faint QSOs. The spheroid sizes and total host luminosities of the radio-quiet PG QSOs in our sample are statistically indistinguishable from the ULIRG hosts presented in Paper I, while those of radio-loud PG QSOs are systematically larger and more luminous. ULIRGs and PG QSOs with elliptical hosts fall near, but not exactly on, the fundamental plane of inactive spheroids. We confirm the systematic trend noted in Paper I for objects with small (< 2 kpc) spheroids to be up to ~1 mag. brighter than inactive spheroids. The host colors and wavelength dependence of their sizes support the idea that these deviations are due at least in part to non-nuclear star formation. However, the amplitudes of these deviations does not depend on host R-H colors. Taken at face value (i.e., no correction for extinction or the presence of a young stellar population), the H-band spheroid-host luminosities imply BH masses ~5 -- 200 x 107 Msun and sub-Eddington mass accretion rates for both QSOs and ULIRGs. These results are compared with published BH mass estimates derived from other methods. (abridged)",09,[],1
0906.2419,astro-ph,"Rotational studies at a variety of ages and masses are important for constraining the angular momentum evolution of young stellar objects (YSO). Of particular interest are the very low mass (VLM) stars and brown dwarfs (BDs), because of the significant lack of known rotational periods in that mass range. We provide for the first time information on rotational periods for a large sample of young VLM stars and BDs. This extensive rotational period study in the 1 Myr old Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is based on a deep photometric monitoring campaign using the Wide Field Imager (WFI) camera on the ESO/MPG 2.2m telescope on La Silla, Chile. Accurate I-band photometry of 2908 stars was obtained, extending three magnitudes deeper than previous studies in the ONC. We found 487 periodic variables with estimated masses between 0.5 Msun and 0.015 Msun, 124 of which are BD candidates. This is by far the most extensive and complete rotational period data set for young VLM stars and BDs. In addition, 808 objects show non-periodic brightness variations. We study the dependence of the period distribution on mass and variability level and compare this with known higher mass objects in the ONC (Herbst et al. 2002) and with the 2 Myr old cluster NGC 2264 (Lamm et al., 2004). We find that substellar objects rotate on average faster than the VLM stars. Our rotational data also suggest a dependence of the rotational periods on position within the field, which can be explained by a possible age spread in the ONC. In addition, periodic variables with larger peak-to-peak amplitudes rotate on average slower than those with small peak-to-peak amplitude variations, which can possibly be explained by different magnetic field topologies.",09,[],1
0908.3893,astro-ph,"The nature of the galaxies that give rise to absorption lines, such as damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs) or strong MgII lines, in quasar spectra is difficult to investigate in emission. Taking advantage of the total absorption of the QSO light bluewards of the Lyman limit of two DLAs at z>3.4, we look for the continuum emission from intervening galaxies at z~2 that are identified via strong metal absorption lines. The MgII absorbers have equivalent width large enough to be potential DLA systems. Deep images are obtained with the FOcal Reducer and Spectrograph (FORS1) on the Very Large Telescope for the fields towards SDSS J110855120953 and SDSS J140850020522. These quasars have MgII absorption lines at z=1.87 (Wr(MgII)=2.46 A) and z=1.98 (Wr(MgII)=1.89 A), respectively, and each QSO has two intervening higher redshift DLAs at z>3. The U and R bands of FORS1 lie blue and redwards of the Lyman limit of the background DLAs, allowing us to search for emission from the foreground galaxies directly along the lines of sight to the QSOs. No galaxies are found close to the sight line of the QSO to a point source limit of UAB=28.0. In both fields, the closest objects lie at an impact parameter of 5 arcsec corresponding to 40 kpc in projection at z=2, and have typical colours of star forming galaxies at that redshift.

0902.2409,astro-ph,"We report on Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-Wave Astronomy (CARMA) and James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) observations toward the Einstein source 1E 1740.7-2942, a LMXB commonly known as the ""Great Annihilator."" The Great Annihilator is known to be near a small, bright molecular cloud on the sky in a region largely devoid of emission in 12-CO surveys of the Galactic Center. The region is of interest because it is interior to the dust lanes which may be the shock zones where atomic gas from HI nuclear disk is converted into molecular gas. We find that the region is populated with a number of dense (n ~ 105 cm-3) regions of excited gas with small filling factors, and estimate that up to 1-3 x 105 solar masses of gas can be seen in our maps. The detection suggests that a significant amount of mass is transported from the shock zones to the GC star-forming regions in the form of small, dense bundles.",09,[],1
0911.0829,astro-ph,"Shell-type supernova remnants (SNRs) exhibit correlations between radio surface brightness, SNR diameter, and ambient medium density. We investigate these correlations, to extract useful information about the typical evolutionary stage of radio SNRs, and to obtain insight into the origin of the relativistic electrons and magnetic fields responsible for the radio emission. We propose a scenario, according to which the observed correlations are the combined effect of SNRs evolving in a wide range of ambient conditions, rather than the evolutionary track of a ""typical"" SNR. We then develop a parametric approach to interpret the statistical data, and apply it to the data sample previously published by Berkhuijsen, as well as to a sample of SNRs in the galaxy M33. We find that SNRs cease to emit effectively in radio at a stage near the end of their Sedov evolution, and that models of synchrotron emission with constant efficiencies in particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification do not provide a close match to the data. We discuss the problem of the cumulative distribution in size, showing that the slope of this distribution does not relate to the expansion law of SNRs, as usually assumed, but only to the ambient density distribution. This solves a long-standing paradox: the almost linear cumulative distribution of SNRs led several authors to conclude that these SNRs are still in free expansion, which also implies very low ambient densities. Within this framework, we discuss the case of the starburst galaxy M82. Statistical properties of SNR samples may be used to shed light on both the physics of electron acceleration and the evolution of SNRs. More precise results could be obtained by combining data of several surveys of SNRs in nearby galaxies.",09,[],1

If this dark matter interpretation is correct, we also predict the possibility of a sharp break in the diffuse gamma ray spectrum coming from final state radiation.",09,[],1
0901.3801,astro-ph,"We use ideal axisymmetric relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations to calculate the spindown of a newly formed millisecond, B ~ 1015 G, magnetar and its interaction with the surrounding stellar envelope during a core-collapse supernova (SN) explosion. The mass, angular momentum, and rotational energy lost by the neutron star are determined self-consistently given the thermal properties of the cooling neutron star's atmosphere and the wind's interaction with the surrounding star. The magnetar drives a relativistic magnetized wind into a cavity created by the outgoing SN shock. For high spindown powers (~ 1051-1052 ergs/s), the magnetar wind is super-fast at almost all latitudes, while for lower spindown powers (~ 1050 erg/s), the wind is sub-fast but still super-Alfvenic. In all cases, the rates at which the neutron star loses mass, angular momentum, and energy are very similar to the corresponding free wind values (<~ 30% differences), in spite of the causal contact between the neutron star and the stellar envelope. In addition, in all cases that we consider, the magnetar drives a collimated (~5-10 deg.) relativistic jet out along the rotation axis of the star. Nearly all of the spindown power of the neutron star escapes via this polar jet, rather than being transferred to the more spherical SN explosion. The properties of this relativistic jet and its expected late-time evolution in the magnetar model are broadly consistent with observations of long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and their associated broad-lined Type Ic SN.",09,[],1
0911.4599,astro-ph,"The current deepest radio surveys detect hundreds of sources per square degree below 0.1mJy. There is a growing consensus that a large fraction of these sources are dominated by star formation although the exact proportion has been debated in the literature. However, the low luminosity of these galaxies at most other wavelengths makes determining the nature of individual sources difficult. If future, deeper surveys performed with the next generation of radio instrumentation are to reap high scientific reward we need to develop reliable methods of distinguishing between radio emission powered by active galactic nuclei (AGN) and that powered by star formation. In particular, we believe that such discriminations should be based on purely radio, or relative to radio, diagnostics. These diagnostics include radio morphology, radio spectral index, polarisation, variability, radio luminosity and flux density ratios with non-radio wavelengths e.g. with different parts of the infrared (IR) regime. We discuss the advantages and limitations of these various diagnostics methods with current and future surveys. However, weeding AGN out of deep radio surveys can already provide several insights into the star formation at high redshift. As well as reproducing the well known rise with redshift in the comoving star formation rate density, we also see evidence for the continued dominance of LIRGs and ULIRGs to the total star forming budget across redshifts 1-3. Additionally, while we see that the IR-radio relation for star forming galaxies does hold to high redshifts (z>1) there is a mild deviation depending on the IR waveband used and the range of IR SEDs found. We will discuss the possible reasons behind this change in properties.",09,[],1
0909.2592,astro-ph,"We systematically investigate the error sources for high-precision astrometry from adaptive optics based near-infrared imaging data. We focus on the application in the crowded stellar field in the Galactic Center. We show that at the level of <=100 micro-arcseconds a number of effects are limiting the accuracy. Most important are the imperfectly subtracted seeing halos of neighboring stars, residual image distortions and unrecognized confusion of the target source with fainter sources in the background. Further contributors to the error budget are the uncertainty in estimating the point spread function, the signal-to-noise ratio induced statistical uncertainty, coordinate transformation errors, the chromaticity of refraction in Earth's atmosphere, the post adaptive optics differential tilt jitter and anisoplanatism. For stars as bright as mK=14, residual image distortions limit the astrometry, for fainter stars the limitation is set by the seeing halos of the surrounding stars. In order to improve the astrometry substantially at the current generation of telescopes, an adaptive optics system with high performance and weak seeing halos over a relatively small field (r<=3"") is suited best. Furthermore, techniques to estimate or reconstruct the seeing halo could be promising.",09,[],1
0909.1593,astro-ph,"We have implemented a simple model to identify the likely sites of the first stars and galaxies in the high-resolution simulations of the formation of galactic dark matter halos of the Aquarius Project. The first star in a galaxy like the Milky Way formed around redshift z=35; by z=10, the young galaxy contained up to 30000 dark matter haloes capable of forming stars by molecular hydrogen cooling. These minihaloes were strongly clustered and feedback may have severely limited the actual number of Population III stars that formed. By the present day, the remnants of the first stars would be strongly concentrated to the centre of the main halo. If a second generation of long-lived stars formed near the first (the first star relics), we would expect to find half of them within 30kpc/h of the galactic centre and a significant fraction in satellites where they may be singled out by their anomalous metallicity patterns. The first halo in which gas could cool by atomic hydrogen line radiation formed at z=25; by z=10, the number of such first galaxies had increased to ~300. Feedback might have decreased the number of first galaxies at the time they undergo significant star formation, but not the number that survive to the present because near neighbours merge. Half of all the ""first galaxies"" that form before z=10 merge with the main halo before z~3 and most lose a significant fraction of their mass. However, today there should still be more than 20 remnants orbiting within the central ~30kpc/h of the Milky Way. These satellites have circular velocities of a few kilometers per second or more, comparable to those of known Milky Way dwarfs. They are a promising hunting ground for the remnants of the earliest epoch of star formation.",09,[],1

0903.2402,cond-mat,"The influence of the deposition pressure PO2 and substrate temperature TS during the growth of Bi2FeCrO6 thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition has been investigated. It is found that the high volatility of Bi makes the deposition very difficult and that the growth of pure Bi2FeCrO6 thin films on SrTiO3 substrates is possible only in a narrow deposition parameter window. We find that the pure Bi2FeCrO6 phase is formed within a narrow window around an oxygen pressure PO2 =1.210-2 mbar and around a substrate temperature TS=680 degC. At lower temperature or higher pressure, Bi7.38Cr0.62O12xalso called (b*Bi2O3)and Bi2Fe4O9 /Bi2(Fe,Cr)4O9x phases are detected, while at lower pressure or higher temperature a (Fe,Cr)3O4 phase forms.

We previously reported Fe/Cr cation ordering as the probable origin of the tenfold improvement in magnetization at saturation of our Bi2FeCrO6 film, compared to BiFeO3. Here, we address the effect of the degree of cationic ordering on the magnetic properties of the Bi2FeCrO6 single phase.

0907.2779,cond-mat,"In a Bose superfluid, the coupling between transverse (phase) and longitudinal fluctuations leads to a divergence of the longitudinal correlation function, which is responsible for the occurrence of infrared divergences in the perturbation theory and the breakdown of the Bogoliubov approximation. We report a non-perturbative renormalization-group (NPRG) calculation of the one-particle Green function of an interacting boson system at zero temperature. We find two regimes separated by a characteristic momentum scale equation (""Ginzburg"" scale). While the Bogoliubov approximation is valid at large momenta and energies, equation (with equation the velocity of the Bogoliubov sound mode), in the infrared (hydrodynamic) regime equation the normal and anomalous self-energies exhibit singularities reflecting the divergence of the longitudinal correlation function. In particular, we find that the anomalous self-energy agrees with the Bogoliubov result equation at high-energies and behaves as equation in the infrared regime (with equation the space dimension), in agreement with the Nepomnyashchii identity equation and the predictions of Popov's hydrodynamic theory. We argue that the hydrodynamic limit of the one-particle Green function is fully determined by the knowledge of the exponent equation characterizing the divergence of the longitudinal susceptibility and the Ward identities associated to gauge and Galilean invariances.

Special attention is paid to check separately the two underlying fundamental statements into which the considered theory can be recast, namely (i) a single relation between the invariants of stress and strain rate tensors and (ii) the alignment between these tensors. Interestingly, the first prediction is fairly well verified over more than four decades of small strain rate, from the surface rapid flow to the quasi-static creep phase, where it is usually believed to fail because of jamming. On the other hand, the alignment between stress and strain rate tensors is shown to fail over the whole flow, what yields an apparent violation of the visco-plastic rheology when applied without care.

Single crystal x-ray diffraction studies confirmed that EuPd2Sb2 crystallizes in the CaBe2Ge2-type structure.

(ii) Solving the resulting coupled differential equations imposes heavy numerics which completely hide the physics. This can be completely avoided if, instead of free electron-hole pairs, we use correlated pairs, i.e., excitons.

The second term comes with a new meaning: it is the correlation between the observable and the excess in dynamical activity or reactivity, playing an important role in dynamical fluctuation theory out-of-equilibrium. It appears as a generalized escape rate in the occupation statistics. The resulting response formula holds for all observables and allows direct numerical or experimental evaluation, for example in the discussion of effective temperatures, as it only involves the statistical averaging of explicit quantities, e.g. without needing an expression for the nonequilibrium distribution.

0904.2883,cond-mat,"It is known that in the two-dimensional disordered superconductors electron-electron interactions in the Cooper channel lead to the negative logarithmic in temperature correction to the tunneling conductance above the critical temperature. Physically this result appears due to the density of states suppression by superconductive fluctuations near the Fermi level. It is interesting that the other correction, which accounts for the Maki-Thompson-type interaction of fluctuations, is positive and exhibits strong power law, which dominates the logarithmic term in the immediate vicinity of the critical temperature. An interplay between these two contributions determines the zero-bias anomaly in fluctuating superconductors. This paper is devoted to the fate of such interaction corrections in the ballistic superconductors. It turns out that ballistic dynamic fluctuations perturb single-particle density of states near the Fermi level at the energy scale which is different from that in the diffusive case. As the consequence, fluctuation region becomes much broader. In this regime we confirm that correction to the tunneling conductance remains negative and logarithmic not too close to the critical temperature while in the immediate vicinity of the transition we find novel power law for the Maki-Thompson contribution.

0909.4920,cond-mat,"In magnetic systems with reduced dimensionality, the effects of dipolar interactions allow the existence of long-range ordered phases. Long-range magnetic-dipolar interactions are at the heart of the explanation of many peculiar phenomena observed in nuclear magnetic resonance, ferromagnetic resonance, and Bose-Einstein-condensate structures. In this paper we show that magnetic-dipolar-modes (MDMs) in quasi-2D ferrite disks are characterized by symmetry breaking effects. Our analysis is based on postulates about a physical meaning of the magnetostatic-potential function as a complex scalar wave function, which presumes the long-range phase correlations. An important feature of the MDM oscillations in a ferrite disk concerns the fact that a structure with symmetric parameters and symmetric basic equations goes into eigenstates that are not space-time symmetric. The proper solutions are found based on an analysis of magnetostatic-wave propagation in a helical coordinate system. For a ferrite disk, we show that while a composition of two helical waves may acquire a geometrical phase over-running of during a period, every separate helical wave has a dynamical phase over-running of and so behaves as a double-valued function. We demonstrate that unique topological structures of the fields in a ferrite disk are intimately related to the symmetry breaking properties of MDM oscillations. The solutions give the MDM power-flow-density vortices with cores at the disk center and azimuthally running waves of magnetization.

It will then be shown how the states can be symmetry classified and their relation to the original classification in even-parity spin-singlet and odd-parity spin-triplet pairing states. The general Ginzburg-Landau functional will be derived and applied to the nucleation of superconductivity in a magnetic field. It will be shown that magneto-electric effects can modify the standard paramagnetic limiting behavior drastically.,09,[],8
0912.1006,cond-mat,The theory of elastic interaction of micron size axially symmetric colloidal particles immersed into confined nematic liquid crystal has been proposed. General formulas are obtained for the self energy of one colloidal particle and interaction energy between two particles in arbitrary confined NLC with strong anchoring condition on the bounding surface. Particular cases of dipole-dipole interaction in the homeotropic and planar nematic cell with thickness equation are considered and found to be exponentially screened on far distances with decay length equation. It is predicted that bounding surfaces in the planar cell crucially change the attraction and repulsion zones of usual dipole-dipole interaction. As well it is predicted that \textitthe decay length in quadrupolar interaction is \textittwo times smaller than for the dipolar case.,09,[],8
0901.0093,cond-mat,"The properties of excitons in semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), isolated in vacuum or a medium, and their contributions to the optical spectra of nanotubes are studied within the elementary potential model, in which an exciton is represented as a bound state of two oppositely charged quasi-particles confined to the nanotube surface. The emphasis is given on the influence of dielectric environment surrounding a nanotube on the exciton spectra. For nanotubes in environment with permittivity less than 1.8 the ground-state exciton binding energies exceed the respective energy gaps, while the obtained binding energies of excitons in nanotubes in a medium with permittivity greater than 4 are in good accordance with the corresponding experimental data and consistent with known scaling relation for the environmental effect. The stabilization process of single-electron spectrum in SWCNTs in media with rather low permittivities is discussed.",09,[],8
0906.1248,cond-mat,"An SU(2) slave boson formulation of bond-type spin nematic orders is developed in frustrated ferromagnets, where the spin nematic states are described as the resonating spin-triplet valence bond (RVB) states. The d-vectors of spin-triplet pairing ansatzes play the role of the directors in the bond-type spin quadrupolar states. The low-energy excitations around such spin-triplet RVB ansatzes generally comprise the (potentially massless) gauge bosons, massless Goldstone bosons, and spinon individual excitations. Extending the projective symmetry group argument to the spin-triplet ansatzes, we show how to identify the number of massless gauge bosons efficiently. Applying this formulation, we next (i) enumerate possible mean field solutions for the S=1/2 ferromagnetic J1-J2 Heisenberg model on the square lattice, with ferromagnetic nearest neighbor J1 and competing antiferromagnetic next-nearest neighbor J2, and (ii) argue their stability against small gauge fluctuations. As a result, two stable spin-triplet RVB ansatzes are found in the intermediate coupling regime around J1:J2 \simeq 1:0.4. One is the Z2 Balian-Werthamer (BW) state stabilized by the Higgs mechanism and the other is the SU(2) chiral p-wave (Anderson-Brinkman-Morel) state stabilized by the Chern-Simon mechanism. The former Z2 BW state in fact shows the same bond-type spin quadrupolar order as found in the previous exact diagonalization study [N. Shannon et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 027213 (2006)].",09,[],8

In the present work, we therefore construct the finite temperature phase diagram of an interacting atomic mixture of Bose and Fermi superfluids. Our study reveals a unique region of phase space, where the BCS instability of the Fermi surface coincides with dynamical instability of the homogeneous mixture towards phase separation through a first-order transition.

In the presence of a nested Fermi surface, the bosons may develop a fascinating supersolid behavior characterized by a finite superfluid density as well as a spatial density wave order. Focusing on the triangular lattice geometry and combining a general Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson approach with microscopically derived mean-field theory, we find an exotic supersolid phase at a fermionic band-filling of equation with a Kagome-type crystalline order. We also address the case of anisotropic hopping amplitudes, and show that striped supersolid phases emerge on the square and triangular lattices. For weak interactions, the supersolid competes with phase separation. For strong intra- and inter-species interactions, with the total number of fermions and bosons corresponding to one particle per site, the bosons form an alternating Mott insulator ground state.

Using the infinite Time Evolving Block Decimation algorithm, we characterise this crossover by making quantitative predictions for the time-dependent behaviour of the currents and their decay rate.

0911.1139,cond-mat,"The effect of carrier multiplication (CM) in semiconductor nanocrystals is systematically treated by employing an exciton scattering approach. Using projection operators, we reduce the Coulomb coupled multi-exciton dynamics to scattering dynamics in the space spanning both single- and bi-exciton states. We derive a closed set of equations determining the scattering matrix elements. This allows us to interpret CM dynamics as a series of odd-order interband scattering events. Using the time-dependent density matrix formalism, we provide a rigorous description of the CM dynamics induced by a finite-time pump pulse. Within this approach, both processes of single- and bi-exciton photogeneration and the consequent population relaxation are treated on the same footing. This approach provides a framework for numerical calculations and for comparisons of the quantum efficiencies associated with each process.

0904.1467,cond-mat,"For more than 20 years it has been debated if yield stress fluids are solid below the yield stress or actually flow; whether true yield stress fluids exist or not. Advocates of the true yield stress picture have demonstrated that the effective viscosity increases very rapidly as the stress is decreased towards the yield stress. Opponents have shown that this viscosity increase levels off, and that the material behaves as a Newtonian fluid of very high viscosity below the yield stress. In this paper, we demonstrate experimentally (on four different materials, using three different rheometers, five different geometries, and two different measurement methods) that the low-stress Newtonian viscosity is an artifact that arises in non steady state experiments. For measurements as long as 10,000 seconds we find that the value of the 'Newtonian viscosity' increases indefinitely. This proves that the yield stress exists and marks a sharp transition between flowing states and states where the steady state viscosity is infinite -a solid!",09,[],8

0903.0808,cond-mat,"Main characteristics of colloidal systems that develop fluid phases with different mechanical properties, namely shear-banding fluids, are briefly reviewed both from experimental and theoretical (modelling) point of view. A non-monotonic shear stress vs. shear rate constitutive relation is presented. This relation derives from a phenomenological model of a shear ratedependent viscosity describing structural changes and involves the possibility of multivalued shear rates under a given shear stress. In the case of a stress-dependent viscosity, the same model allows one to predict vorticity banding. Predictions of this model under controlled stress are discussed, namely occurrence of a kind of top- and bottom-jumping of the shear rate in response to stress increasing-decreasing. Applying this model to evaluation of the flow curve of such colloidal systems is performed. Particular emphasis is placed on the adequate computation of the shear rate function in cylindrical Couette cells in order to handle the corresponding flow curve which exhibits the well-known shear stress plateau. Indeed, as different fluid phases coexist in the flow domain, measured (torque vs. angular velocity) data cannot be directly converted into rheometric (shear stress vs. shear rate) functions. As the lacking non-local terms in the model prevents the direct determination of the stress-plateau, this value is included as an adjustable parameter. Thus model predictions satisfactorily match up experimental data of wormlike micellar solutions from the literature.",09,[],8
0911.4488,cond-mat,"An anisotropic equation of state (EOS) is proposed for the accurate extrapolation of high-pressure shock Hugoniot (anisotropic and isotropic) states to other thermodynamic (anisotropic and isotropic) states for a shocked carbon-fibre epoxy composite (CFC) of any symmetry. The proposed EOS, using a generalised decomposition of a stress tensor [Int. J. Plasticity \textbf24, 140 (2008)], represents a mathematical and physical generalisation of the Mie-Gruneisen EOS for isotropic material and reduces to this equation in the limit of isotropy. Although a linear relation between the generalised anisotropic bulk shock velocity equation and particle velocity equation was adequate in the through-thickness orientation, damage softening process produces discontinuities both in value and slope in the equation-equation relation. Therefore, the two-wave structure (non-linear anisotropic and isotropic elastic waves) that accompanies damage softening process was proposed for describing CFC behaviour under shock loading. The linear relationship equation-equation over the range of measurements corresponding to non-linear anisotropic elastic wave shows a value of equation (the intercept of the equation-equation curve) that is in the range between first and second generalised anisotropic bulk speed of sound [Eur. Phys. J. B \textbf64, 159 (2008)]. An analytical calculation showed that Hugoniot Stress Levels (HELs) in different directions for a CFC composite subject to the two-wave structure (non-linear anisotropic elastic and isotropic elastic waves) agree with experimental measurements at low and at high shock intensities.

In this formulation we treat the spatial disorder exactly, and therefore we account for effects arising from localization physics. We have examined the model for electronic densities well away 1/2 filling, thereby avoiding the physics of a Mott insulator. Several recent studies have made clear that the combined effects of electronic interactions and spatial disorder can give rise to a suppression of the electronic density of states, and a subsequent metal-insulator transition can occur. We augment such studies by calculating the ac conductivity for such systems. Our numerical results show that weak interactions enhance the density of states at the Fermi level and the low-frequency conductivity, there are no local magnetic moments, and the ac conductivity is Drude-like. However, with a large enough disorder strength and larger interactions the density of states at the Fermi level and the low-frequency conductivity are both suppressed, the conductivity becomes non-Drude-like, and these phenomena are accompanied by the presence of local magnetic moments. The low-frequency conductivity changes from a sigma-sigmadc omega1/2 behaviour in the metallic phase, to a sigma omega2 behaviour in the nonmetallic regime.

(ii) At equationC equation, the stress plateau is shown to correspond to stationary shear-banded states characterized by two high shear rate bands close to the walls and a very weakly sheared central band, together with large slip velocities at the rotor. In both cases, the high shear branch of the flow curve is characterized by flow instability. Interpretations of wall slip, three-band structure, and instability are proposed in light of recent theoretical models and experiments.",09,[],8
0901.1491,cond-mat,"Half-Heusler phases have gained recently much interest as thermoelectric materials. Screening of possible systems was performed by ab-initio simulation using VASP-software. The energy-versus-Volume (E(V)) curves were calculated and calibrated. For TiCoSb, NbNiSn, FeMoSb the stability of Half-Heusler phase against concurrent crystal structures like TiNiSi, ZrCoAl, ZrBeSi, FeSiV, ZrNiP and Full Heusler was confirmed. However, the thermo-dynamical driving force as calculated from the difference in lattice energies is less than 0.1eV/atom. Hence, the fabrication of Half Heusler phases is a challenge and requires three steps, surface activation of the raw material by ball milling, arc-melting of pressed pellets and finally long-term annealing treatment in a vacuum furnace. On doped TiCoSb specimens, Seebeck coefficients up to 0.1 mV/K, on NiNbSn 0.16 mV/K were measured, although the microstructure was not yet optimized.",09,[],8

0909.1788,cs,"Reliable systems have always been built out of unreliable components. Early on, the reliable components were small such as mirrored disks or ECC (Error Correcting Codes) in core memory. These systems were designed such that failures of these small components were transparent to the application. Later, the size of the unreliable components grew larger and semantic challenges crept into the application when failures occurred.   As the granularity of the unreliable component grows, the latency to communicate with a backup becomes unpalatable. This leads to a more relaxed model for fault tolerance. The primary system will acknowledge the work request and its actions without waiting to ensure that the backup is notified of the work. This improves the responsiveness of the system.   There are two implications of asynchronous state capture: 1) Everything promised by the primary is probabilistic. There is always a chance that an untimely failure shortly after the promise results in a backup proceeding without knowledge of the commitment. Hence, nothing is guaranteed! 2) Applications must ensure eventual consistency. Since work may be stuck in the primary after a failure and reappear later, the processing order for work cannot be guaranteed.   Platform designers are struggling to make this easier for their applications. Emerging patterns of eventual consistency and probabilistic execution may soon yield a way for applications to express requirements for a ""looser"" form of consistency while providing availability in the face of ever larger failures.   This paper recounts portions of the evolution of these trends, attempts to show the patterns that span these changes, and talks about future directions as we continue to ""build on quicksand"".",09,[],7

Nowadays, jammers can be portable devices that transmit intermittently at low power in order to conserve energy. In this paper, we first conduct extensive experiments on an indoor 802.11 network to assess the ability of two physical layer functions, rate adaptation and power control, in mitigating jamming. In the presence of a jammer we find that: (a) the use of popular rate adaptation algorithms can significantly degrade network performance and, (b) appropriate tuning of the carrier sensing threshold allows a transmitter to send packets even when being jammed and enables a receiver capture the desired signal. Based on our findings, we build ARES, an Anti-jamming REinforcement System, which tunes the parameters of rate adaptation and power control to improve the performance in the presence of jammers. ARES ensures that operations under benign conditions are unaffected.

0912.2199,cs,"Mobile Ad Hoc networks, due to the unattended nature of the network itself and the dispersed location of nodes, are subject to several unique security issues. One of the most vexed security threat is node capture. A few solutions have already been proposed to address this problem; however, those solutions are either centralized or focused on theoretical mobility models alone. In the former case the solution does not fit well the distributed nature of the network while, in the latter case, the quality of the solutions obtained for realistic mobility models severely differs from the results obtained for theoretical models. The rationale of this paper is inspired by the observation that re-encounters of mobile nodes do elicit a form of social ties. Leveraging these ties, it is possible to design efficient and distributed algorithms that, with a moderated degree of node cooperation, enforce the emergent property of node capture detection. In particular, in this paper we provide a proof of concept proposing a set of algorithms that leverage, to different extent, node mobility and node cooperation--that is, identifying social ties--to thwart node capture attack. In particular, we test these algorithms on a realistic mobility scenario.

0904.2320,cs,"Experimental verification has been the method of choice for verifying the stability of a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm as the number of agents grows and theoretical analysis becomes prohibitively complex. For cooperative agents, where the ultimate goal is to optimize some global metric, the stability is usually verified by observing the evolution of the global performance metric over time. If the global metric improves and eventually stabilizes, it is considered a reasonable verification of the system's stability.   The main contribution of this note is establishing the need for better experimental frameworks and measures to assess the stability of large-scale adaptive cooperative systems. We show an experimental case study where the stability of the global performance metric can be rather deceiving, hiding an underlying instability in the system that later leads to a significant drop in performance.

At the same time, our mechanisms must provide a small approximation ratio with respect to one of two optimization targets: the social cost or the maximum cost.   We give an almost complete characterization of the feasible truthful approximation ratio under both target functions, deterministic and randomized mechanisms, and with respect to different network topologies. Our main results are: We show that a simple randomized mechanism is group strategyproof and gives a (2-2/n)-approximation for the social cost, where n is the number of agents, when the network is a circle (known as a ring in the case of computer networks); we design a novel ""hybrid"" strategyproof randomized mechanism that provides a tight approximation ratio of 3/2 for the maximum cost when the network is a circle; and we show that no randomized SP mechanism can provide an approximation ratio better than 2-o(1) to the maximum cost even when the network is a tree, thereby matching a trivial upper bound of two.",09,[],7

0907.3047,cs,"The efficiency and the performance of anagement systems is becoming a hot research topic within the networks and services management community. This concern is due to the new challenges of large scale managed systems, where the management plane is integrated within the functional plane and where management activities have to carry accurate and up-to-date information. We defined a set of primary and secondary metrics to measure the performance of a management approach. Secondary metrics are derived from the primary ones and quantifies mainly the efficiency, the scalability and the impact of management activities. To validate our proposals, we have designed and developed a benchmarking platform dedicated to the measurement of the performance of a JMX manager-agent based management system. The second part of our work deals with the collection of measurement data sets from our JMX benchmarking platform. We mainly studied the effect of both load and the number of agents on the scalability, the impact of management activities on the user perceived performance of a managed server and the delays of JMX operations when carrying variables values. Our findings show that most of these delays follow a Weibull statistical distribution. We used this statistical model to study the behavior of a monitoring algorithm proposed in the literature, under heavy tail delays distribution. In this case, the view of the managed system on the manager side becomes noisy and out of date.",09,[],7

This coarse view can be refined by looking at the dependencies among rule occurrences, by recording, for an object, which was the a rule that produced it and subsequently (in a later step), which was the a rule that consumed it. In this paper we propose a way to look also at the other main ingredient in membrane system computations, namely the simultaneity in the rule applications. This is achieved using zero-safe nets that allows to synchronize transitions, i.e., rule occurrences. Zero-safe nets can be unfolded into occurrence nets in a classical way, and to this unfolding an event structure can be associated. The capability of capturing simultaneity of zero-safe nets is transferred on the level of event structure by adding a way to express which events occur simultaneously.",09,[],7
0905.2882,cs,"Our aim in this paper is to analyse the phenotypic effects (evolvability) of diverse coding conversion operators in an instance of the states based evolutionary algorithm (SEA). Since the representation of solutions or the selection of the best encoding during the optimization process has been proved to be very important for the efficiency of evolutionary algorithms (EAs), we will discuss a strategy of coupling more than one representation and different procedures of conversion from one coding to another during the search. Elsewhere, some EAs try to use multiple representations (SM-GA, SEA, etc.) in intention to benefit from the characteristics of each of them. In spite of those results, this paper shows that the change of the representation is also a crucial approach to take into consideration while attempting to increase the performances of such EAs. As a demonstrative example, we use a two states SEA (2-SEA) which has two identical search spaces but different coding conversion operators.

In many applications, however, graphs that arise have several \emphlocal regions of interest, and the second eigenvector will typically fail to provide information fine-tuned to each local region. In this paper, we introduce a locally-biased analogue of the second eigenvector, and we demonstrate its usefulness at highlighting local properties of data graphs in a semi-supervised manner. To do so, we first view the second eigenvector as the solution to a constrained optimization problem, and we incorporate the local information as an additional constraint; we then characterize the optimal solution to this new problem and show that it can be interpreted as a generalization of a Personalized PageRank vector; and finally, as a consequence, we show that the solution can be computed in nearly-linear time. In addition, we show that this locally-biased vector can be used to compute an approximation to the best partition \emphnear an input seed set in a manner analogous to the way in which the second eigenvector of the Laplacian can be used to obtain an approximation to the best partition in the entire input graph.

0909.3091,cs,"A cross-layer scheme, namely ALOHA With Collision Resolution (ALOHA-CR), is proposed for high throughput wireless communications in a cellular scenario. Transmissions occur in a time-slotted ALOHA-type fashion but with an important difference: simultaneous transmissions of two users can be successful. If more than two users transmit in the same slot the collision cannot be resolved and retransmission is required. If only one user transmits, the transmitted packet is recovered with some probability, depending on the state of the channel. If two users transmit the collision is resolved and the packets are recovered by first over-sampling the collision signal and then exploiting independent information about the two users that is contained in the signal polyphase components. The ALOHA-CR throughput is derived under the infinite backlog assumption and also under the assumption of finite backlog. The contention probability is determined under these two assumptions in order to maximize the network throughput and maintain stability. Queuing delay analysis for network users is also conducted. The performance of ALOHA-CR is demonstrated on the Wireless Open Access Research Platform (WARP) test-bed containing five software defined radio nodes.

Each vertex equation holds a constant-sized reading normalized to 1 byte that needs to be communicated to the equation. The communication protocol is defined such that readings travel in packets. The packets have a capacity of equation bytes. We define a \em packet hop to be the communication of a packet from a vertex to its neighbor. Each packet hop drains one unit of energy and therefore, we need to communicate the readings to the equation with the fewest number of hops.   We show this problem to be NP-hard and counter it with a simple distributed equation-approximation algorithm called \tt SPT that uses the shortest path tree rooted at the equation. We also show that \tt SPT is absolutely optimal when equation is a tree and asymptotically optimal when equation is a grid. Furthermore, \tt SPT has two nice properties. Firstly, the readings always travel along a shortest path toward the equation, which makes it an appealing solution to the convergecast problem as it fits the natural intuition. Secondly, each node employs a very elementary packing strategy. Given all the readings that enter into the node, it sends out as many fully packed packets as possible followed by at most 1 partial packet. We show that any solution that has either one of the two properties cannot be a equation-approximation, for any fixed equation. This makes \spt optimal for the class of algorithms that obey either one of those properties.",09,[],7

There are follow different cases due to the energy of radial particle: 1) When the energy of radial particle is higher than a critical value equation, the particle will fall from infinity to the singularity directly; 2) When the energy of radial particle equals to the critical value equation, the particle orbit is unstable at equation, i.e. the particle will escape from equation to the infinity or to the singularity, which is determined by the initial conditions of the particle; 3) When the energy of radial particle is in a proper range, the particle will rebound to the infinity or plunge to the singularity from a infinite distance, which is also determined by the initial conditions of the particle.",09,[],13

0911.4852,gr-qc,"Our attempts to find an explanation for quantum behavior of the Early Universe appeal, as a rule, to the Wheeler - DeWitt Quantum Geometrodynamics which relies upon Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity proposed by Arnowitt, Deser and Misner (ADM). In spite of the fact that the basic ideas of this approach were put forward about fifty years ago, even now we do not have clear understanding what Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity must be. An evidence for it gives a recent paper by Kiriushcheva and Kuzmin [arXiv:0809.0097], where the authors claim that the formulation by ADM and that by Dirac made in his seminal work of 1958 are not equivalent. If so, we face the question what formalism should be chosen. Another problem is that we need a well-grounded procedure of constructing a generator of transformations in phase space for all gravitational variables including gauge ones. It suggests the notion of extended phase space. After analyzing the situation, we show that Hamiltonian formulation in extended phase space is a real alternative to Dirac and ADM formulations and can be constructed to be equivalent to the original (Lagrangian) formulation of General Relativity. Quantization in extended phase space is straightforward and leads to a new description of quantum Universe in which an essential place is given to gauge degrees of freedom.",09,[],13

It reveals that the quantum bounce is generic, regardless of the order of corrections, and the matter density remains finite, bounded from above by an upper bound in the regime of the Planckian density, even if all orders of corrections are included. This observation provides further evidence that the quantum bounce is essentially a consequence of the loopy nature (i.e. intrinsic discreteness) of LQC and LQC is fundamentally different from the Wheeler-DeWitt theory; it also encourages one to construct the quantum theory of LQC with the higher order holonomy corrections, which might be understood as related to the higher equation representations in the Hamiltonian operator of loop quantum gravity.",09,[],13
0904.1715,gr-qc,"Gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries are one of the most promising sources for detectors such as LIGO, Virgo and GEO600. If the components of the binary posess significant angular momentum (spin), as is likely to be the case if one component is a black hole, spin-induced precession of a binary's orbital plane causes modulation of the gravitational-wave amplitude and phase. If the templates used in a matched-filter search do not accurately model these effects then the sensitivity, and hence the detection rate, will be reduced. We investigate the ability of several search pipelines to detect gravitational waves from compact binaries with spin. We use the post-Newtonian approximation to model the inspiral phase of the signal and construct two new template banks using the phenomenological waveforms of Buonanno, Chen and Vallisneri. We compare the performance of these template banks to that of banks constructed using the stationary phase approximation to the non-spinning post-Newtonian inspiral waveform currently used by LIGO and Virgo in the search for compact binary coalescence. We find that, at the same false alarm rate, a search pipeline using phenomenological templates is no more effective than a pipeline which uses non-spinning templates. We recommend the continued use of the non-spinning stationary phase template bank until the false alarm rate associated with templates which include spin effects can be substantially reduced.",09,[],13
0906.3315,gr-qc,"In this work we analyze the effects produced by bosonic and fermionic constituents, including quantum corrections, in two-dimensional (2D) cosmological models. We focus on a gravitational theory related to the Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger model, to simulate the dynamics of a young, spatially-lineal, universe. The cosmic substratum is formed by an \it inflaton field plus a matter component, sources of the 2D gravitational field; the degrees of freedom also include the presence of a dilaton field. We show that this combination permits, among other scenarios, the simulation of a period of inflation, that would be followed by a (bosonic/fermionic) matter dominated era. We also analyse how quantum effects contribute to the destiny of the expansion, given the fact that in 2D we have a consistent (renormalizable) quantum theory of gravity. The dynamical behavior of the system follows from the solution of the gravitational field equations, the (Klein-Gordon and Dirac) equations for the sources and the dilaton field equation. Consistent (accelerated) regimes are present among the solutions of the 2D equations; the results depend strongly on the initial conditions used for the dilaton field.

General relativistic quantum interference effects in the slowly rotating braneworld as the Sagnac effect and phase shift effect of interfering particle in neutron interferometer are considered. It was found that in the case of the Sagnac effect the influence of brane parameter is becoming important due to the fact that the angular velocity of the locally non rotating observer must be larger than one in the Kerr space-time. In the case of neutron interferometry it is found that due to the presence of the parameter equation an additional term in the phase shift of interfering particle emerges from the results of the recent experiments we have obtained upper limit for the tidal charge as equation.

An alternative Hamiltonian constraint operator is constructed, which is shown to have the correct classical limit by the semiclassical analysis. The effective Hamiltonian incorporating higher order quantum corrections is also obtained. In the spatially flat FRW model with a massless scalar field, the classical big bang is again replaced by a quantum bounce.

It is possible to show that there are situations in which the geodesic acceleration of a particle may acquire arbitrary values, whereas the curvature tensor approaches zero. We conclude that the spacetime curvature does not affect the geodesic acceleration. Then we consider the the Pound-Rebka experiment, which relates the time interval equation of two light signals emitted at a position equation, to the time interval equation of the signals received at a position equation, in a Schwarzschild type gravitational field. The experiment is determined by four spacetime events. The infinitesimal vectors formed by these events do not form a parallelogram in the (t,r) plane.

0909.1074,gr-qc,"Recent observations of the luminosity-red shift relation of distant type Ia supernovae established the fact that the expansion of the universe is accelerated. This is interpreted by saying that there exists some kind of agent (called dark energy), which exerts an overall repulsive effect on ordinary matter. Dark energy contributes today in the amount of about 73 % to the total energy content of the universe, and its spatial distribution is compatible with perfect uniformity. The simplest possible explanation for dark energy is to assume that it is just a universal constant, the so called cosmological constant. This would mean that the background arena for all natural phenomena, once all physical matter-energy has been ideally removed, is the de Sitter space time. Thus, the Poincar\'e group should be replaced by the de Sitter group, and one is naturally led to a reformulation of the theory of special relativity on these grounds. The absence of a privileged class of equivalent frames (inertial frames) suggests that, in de Sitter relativity it would be desirable, to characterize significant physical quantities in an intrinsic way, namely in a manner independent of the choice of any particular coordinate patch.

0908.4593,gr-qc,"A new definition of coarse-grained quantities describing the dust flow in General Relativity is proposed. It assigns the coarse--grained expansion, shear and vorticity to finite-size comoving domains of fluid in a covariant, coordinate-independent manner. The coarse--grained quantities are all quasi-local functionals, depending only on the geometry of the boundary of the considered domain. They can be thought of as relativistic generalizations of simple volume averages of local quantities in a flat space. The procedure is based on the isometric embedding theorem for S2 surfaces and thus requires the boundary of the domain in question to have spherical topology and positive scalar curvature. We prove that in the limit of infinitesimally small volume the proposed quantities reproduce the local expansion, shear and vorticity. In case of irrotational flow we derive the time evolution for the coarse-grained quantities and show that its structure is very similar to the evolution equation for their local counterparts. Additional terms appearing in it may serve as a measure of the backreacton of small-scale inhomogeneities of the flow on the large-scale motion of the fluid inside the domain and therefore the result may be interesting in the context of the cosmological backreaction problem.

0902.0190,gr-qc,"The incompatibility between GR and QM is generally seen as a sufficient motivation for the development of a theory of Quantum Gravity. If - so a typical argumentation - QM gives a universally valid basis for the description of all natural systems, then the gravitational field should have quantum properties. Together with the arguments against semi-classical theories of gravity, this leads to a strategy which takes a quantization of GR as the natural avenue to Quantum Gravity. And a quantization of the gravitational field would in some sense correspond to a quantization of geometry. Spacetime would have quantum properties. But, this strategy will only be successful, if gravity is a fundamental interaction. - What, if gravity is instead an intrinsically classical phenomenon? Then, if QM is nevertheless fundamentally valid, gravity can not be a fundamental interaction. An intrinsically classical gravity in a quantum world would have to be an emergent, induced or residual, macroscopic effect, caused by other interactions. The gravitational field (as well as spacetime) would not have any quantum properties. A quantization of GR would lead to artifacts without any relation to nature. The serious problems of all approaches to Quantum Gravity that start from a direct quantization of GR or try to capture the quantum properties of gravity in form of a 'graviton' dynamics - together with the, meanwhile, rich spectrum of approaches to an emergent gravity and/or spacetime - make this latter option more and more interesting for the development of a theory of Quantum Gravity.

In the concrete case of the X(3872) resonance, understood as a bound state of equation and equation (and equation), with the equation loosely bound, we find that the couplings to the two channels are essentially equal leading to a state of good isospin I=0 character. This is in spite of having a probability for finding the equation state much larger than for equation since the loosely bound channel extends further in space. The analytical results, obtained with exact solutions of the Schrodinger equation for the wave functions, can be useful in general to interpret results found numerically in the study of problems with unitary coupled channels methods.",09,[],2
0907.1486,hep-ph,"We investigate the prospects for indirect detection of right-handed sneutrino dark matter at the IceCube neutrino telescope in a equation extension of the MSSM. The capture and annihilation of sneutrinos inside the Sun reach equilibrium, and the flux of produced neutrinos is governed by the sneutrino-proton elastic scattering cross section, which has an upper bound of equation pb from the equation mass limits in the equation model. Despite the absence of any spin-dependent contribution, the muon event rates predicted by this model can be detected at IceCube since sneutrinos mainly annihilate into leptonic final states by virtue of the fermion equation charges. These subsequently decay to neutrinos with 100% efficiency. The Earth muon event rates are too small to be detected for the standard halo model irrespective of an enhanced sneutrino annihilation cross section that can explain the recent PAMELA data. For modified velocity distributions, the Earth muon events increase substantially and can be greater than the IceCube detection threshold of 12 events equation equation. However, this only leads to a mild increase of about 30% for the Sun muon events. The number of muon events from the Sun can be as large as roughly 100 events equation equation for this model.",09,[],2
0909.2653,hep-ph,"We investigate constraints that the requirements of perturbativity and gauge coupling unification impose on extensions of the Standard Model and of the MSSM. In particular, we discuss the renormalization group running in several SUSY left-right symmetric and Pati-Salam models and show how the various scales appearing in these models have to be chosen in order to achieve unification. We find that unification in the considered models occurs typically at scales below MminB violation = 1016 GeV, implying potential conflicts with the non-observation of proton decay. We emphasize that extending the particle content of a model in order to push the GUT scale higher or to achieve unification in the first place will very often lead to non-perturbative evolution. We generalize this observation to arbitrary extensions of the Standard Model and of the MSSM and show that the requirement of perturbativity up to MminB violation, if considered a valid guideline for model building, severely limits the particle content of any such model, especially in the supersymmetric case. However, we also discuss several mechanisms to circumvent perturbativity and proton decay issues, for example in certain classes of extra dimensional models.",09,[],2

Here we review the different beta-beam scenarios proposed so far and discuss the present status, with a particular emphasis on the original baseline scenario and its feasibility. Alternative strategies for the CP violation search are to be pursued as well. A possibility is to search for CP violation effects in astrophysical environments. Here we present recent analytical and numerical results obtained in the context of core-collapse supernovae.

For large tan beta, the double penguin diagram dominates the SUSY contribution to the Bs - anti-Bs mixing amplitude. Also, the Br(Bs -> mu mu) constraint becomes important as it grows as tan6 beta, although it can still be suppressed by large pseudoscalar Higgs mass mA. We investigate the correlation between Bs -> mu mu and the dark matter direct detection cross-section through their dependence on mA. In the minimal-type of SU(5) with type I seesaw, the large mixing in neutrino Dirac couplings results in large lepton flavor violating decay process tau to mu gamma, which in turn sets upper bound on mA. In the SO(10) case, the large mixing can be chosen to be in the Majorana couplings instead, and the constraint from Br(tau -> mu gamma) can be avoided. The heavy Higgs funnel region turns out to be an interesting possibility in both cases and the direct dark matter detection should be possible in the near future in these scenarios.",09,[],2

Since for letter=0 with physical quark masses QCD is known to exhibit an analytic crossover, this expectation requires the region of chiral transitions to expand with letter for a chiral critical endpoint to exist. Instead, on coarse Nt=4 lattices, we find the area of chiral transitions to shrink with letter, which excludes a chiral critical point for QCD at moderate chemical potentials letterB < 500 MeV.

A horizontal scalar triplet is introduced to make the gauge fields super-massive by breaking the horizontal symmetry at equation. From this scalar triplet, there emerge real scalar fields which do not interact with fermions except for neutrino species and may give substantial influence on evolution of the universe.

Below the masses of the heavier trianons, the model quickly flows to a confining NF=NC=3 supersymmetric gauge theory, as required by phenomenological considerations. We study possible discrete R-symmetries, which guarantee, among other things, that the basin of attraction of the fixed line has full co-dimension in the space of R-allowed couplings. The Yukawa couplings required to get the fixed line violate the pyrma-baryon symmetries we invoked in previous work to find a dark matter candidate.

0910.1789,hep-ph,"If electroweak symmetry breaking arises via strongly-coupled physics, the observed suppression of flavour-changing processes suggests that fermion masses should arise via mixing of elementary fermions with composite fermions of the strong sector.

The latter, since they are coupled to colour, get a mass of the order of several hundred GeV, beyond the reach of current searches at the Tevatron. The same generic mechanism that suppresses flavour-changing processes suppresses leptoquark-mediated rare processes, making it conceivable that the many stringent constraints may be evaded. The leptoquarks couple predominantly to third-generation quarks and leptons, and the prospects for discovery at LHC appear to be good. As an illustration, a model based on the Pati-Salam symmetry is described, and its embedding in models with a larger symmetry incorporating unification of gauge couplings, which provide additional motivation for leptoquark states at or below the TeV scale, is discussed.",09,[],2

This enhances the LHC discovery potential of the chargino and neutralino decays, producing more energetic charged leptons or pions than the decays without the BMSSM corrections. Furthermore, the coannihilation between the lighter chargino or second-lightest neutralino and the LSP is reduced substantially such that the LSP mass does not have to be very heavy.

We find that at temperatures equation the decay widths of the equation that depend on the value of the wave function at the origin are enhanced with respect to the values in vacuum. In the same temperature range the decay width of the process equation is enhanced by approximately a factor 6 with respect to the value in vacuum.

Two new ingredients of the model are (i) the near-equation tightening of the strings, and (ii) physical upper limit of the string length. Then we proceed to more subtle effects related to chiral restoration dynamics near equation: we suggest that ""melting"" of the sigma terms of the lowest nucleon/equation masses can explain these susceptibilities.

The latter is technically natural and avoids fine-tuning and very light scalars. We consider a supersymmetric version of this model, in which two additional doublets are added to the MSSM. If kinematically allowed, the decay of the heavy MSSM scalar into charged nu-Higgs scalars will yield dilepton events which can be separated from the W-pair background.

0903.2729,hep-ph,"One of the well known effects of the asymptotic freedom is splitting of the leading-equation BFKL pomeron into a series of isolated poles in complex angular momentum plane. Following our earlier works we explore the phenomenological consequences of the emerging BFKL-Regge factorized expansion for the small-equation charm (equation) and beauty (equation) structure functions of the proton. As we found earlier,the color dipole approach to the BFKL dynamics predicts uniquely decoupling of subleading hard BFKL exchanges from equation at moderately large equation. We predicted precocious BFKL asymptotics of equation with intercept of the rightmost BFKL pole equation. High-energy open beauty photo- and electro-production probes the vacuum exchange at much smaller distances and detects significant corrections to the BFKL asymptotics coming from the subleading vacuum poles.

The baryon asymmetry in the universe is generated by resonant decays of heavy Kaluza-Klein scalars that are copies of the standard model Higgs. Discrete exchange symmetries between the throats are responsible for establishing two key features of the model. First, they ensure a near degeneracy of the scalar masses and thus a resonant decay of the scalars. This allows for Dirac leptogenesis at low energies close to the TeV scale. Second, the discrete symmetries connect the observed baryon asymmetry with the Yukawa couplings of the low-energy theory. As a consequence, we obtain correlations between the low-energy leptonic mixing parameters and the Dirac CP phase that can be tested at future neutrino oscillation experiments such as neutrino factories.",09,[],2

Particularly stringent constraints on the gravitino-stau scenario arise from the thermal catalysis of primordial nucleosynthesis reactions. This motivates a thorough investigation of the thermal freeze-out process of the long-lived stau.

As a result one obtains a self-consistent theory of the confined region in the (mu,T) plane with realistic hadron properties. At the boundary of the confining region, the colour-electric confining correlator vanishes, and the remaining correlators describe strong nonperturbative dynamics in the deconfined region with (weakly) bound states. Resulting equation of state for mu=0, p(T), (epsilon-3P)/T are in good agreement with lattice data.

0904.1796,hep-ph,"One of the largest theoretical uncertainties assigned to the strong coupling constant alphas as determined from hadronic tau decays stems from the differences in the results for Fixed Order Perturbation Theory (FOPT), Contour Improved Perturbation Theory (CIPT) and Renormalon Chain Perturbation Theory (RCPT). It is often argued that the three methods differ in the treatment of higher orders only and therefore the full difference should be treated as theoretical error. Recently other arguments either in favor of FOPT, CIPT or RCPT have been given, but none of those is able to combine all three to a single value in the strong coupling constant. In this note I will show that FOPT alone has a much larger uncertainty than previously assumed and therefore agrees within error with CIPT. Furthermore a more appropriate matching of the different schemes used in RCPT reduces the difference to the CIPT result by a factor of 6. Together with recently published results for the 4th order term K4 this reduces the theoretical error on alphas by a factor of 2.5 compared to the previously assumed spread of the three perturbative approaches.",09,[],2

0904.0051,hep-th,"We present a detailed study of the finite-temperature behaviour of the LARGE Volume type IIB flux compactifications. We show that certain moduli can thermalise at high temperatures. Despite that, their contribution to the finite-temperature effective potential is always negligible and the latter has a runaway behaviour. We compute the maximal temperature equation, above which the internal space decompactifies, as well as the temperature equation, that is reached after the decay of the heaviest moduli. The natural constraint equation implies a lower bound on the allowed values of the internal volume equation. We find that this restriction rules out a significant range of values corresponding to smaller volumes of the order equation, which lead to standard GUT theories. Instead, the bound favours values of the order equation, which lead to TeV scale SUSY desirable for solving the hierarchy problem. Moreover, our result favours low-energy inflationary scenarios with density perturbations generated by a field, which is not the inflaton. In such a scenario, one could achieve both inflation and TeV-scale SUSY, although gravity waves would not be observable. Finally, we pose a two-fold challenge for the solution of the cosmological moduli problem. First, we show that the heavy moduli decay before they can begin to dominate the energy density of the Universe. Hence they are not able to dilute any unwanted relics.

The elementary wall fluxes can be separated into parallel and antiparallel components. The parallel component affects neither the binding energy nor the process of quantum merger. The antiparallel fluxes, instead, increase the binding energy and, against naive expectations, suppress quantum fusion. In the small flux limit we explicitly find the bounce solution and the fusion rate as a function of the flux. We argue that at large (antiparallel) fluxes there exists a critical value of the flux (versus the difference in the wall tensions), which switches off quantum fusion altogether. This phenomenon of flux-related wall stabilization is rather peculiar: it is unrelated to any conserved quantity. Our consideration of the flux-related all stabilization is based on substantiated arguments that fall short of complete proof.",09,[],4

At weak coupling, the BPS vortices preserving six supersymmetries are found in the Higgs vacuum of the theory where the gauge symmetry is broken to U(1) x U(1). The classical vortex solitons break a colour-flavour locked global symmetry resulting in non-Abelian internal orientational moduli and a CP1 moduli space of solutions. At strong coupling and large k, upon reduction to type IIA strings, the vortex moduli space and its action are computed by a probe D0-brane in the dual geometry. The mass of the D0-brane matches the classical vortex mass. However, the gravity picture exhibits a six dimensional moduli space of solutions, a section of which can be identified as the CP1 we find classically, along with a Dirac monopole connection of strength k.

We study whether this effect can be probed observationally and conclude that the modifications of the power spectrum due to the smoothing on the Planck scale are negligible and far beyond the observational abilities. Subsequently we investigate whether smoothing in any other form can be probed observationally. We introduce phenomenological smoothing factor equation to the inflationary spectrum and investigate its effects on the spectrum of CMB anisotropies and polarisation. We show that smoothing can lead to suppression of high multipoles in the spectrum of the CMB. Based on five years observations of WMAP satellite we indicate that the present scale of high multipoles suppression is constrained by equation Mpc (95% CL).

In this thesis, we construct a class of states for the Klein-Gordon field in Robertson-Walker spacetimes, which seem to provide the first example of thermal states in a spacetime without time translation symmetry. More precisely, in the setting of real, linear, scalar fields in Robertson-Walker spacetimes we define on the set of homogeneous, isotropic, quasi-free states a free energy functional that is based on the averaged energy density measured by an isotropic observer along his worldline. This functional is well defined and lower bounded by a suitable quantum energy inequality. Subsequently, we minimize this functional and obtain states that we interpret as 'almost equilibrium states'.

A consequence is that contributions to the energy momentum tensor of the form of the metric times a spacetime constant, whether classical or quantum, are not sources of curvature in the equations of motion derived from the quantum effective action. This solves the first cosmological constant problem, which is suppressing the enormous contributions to the cosmological constant coming from quantum corrections. We discuss several forms of uniodular gravity and put two of them, including one proposed by Henneaux and Teitelboim, in constrained Hamiltonian form. The path integral is constructed from the latter. Furthermore, the second cosmological constant problem, which is why the measured value is so small, is also addressed by this theory. We argue that a mechanism first proposed by Ng and van Dam for suppressing the cosmological constant by quantum effects obtains at the semiclassical level.",09,[],4

0906.3275,hep-th,"We consider a deformation of the equation solution of IIB supergravity obtained by taking the boundary value of the dilaton to be time dependent. The time dependence is taken to be slowly varying on the AdS scale thereby introducing a small parameter equation. The boundary dilaton has a profile which asymptotes to a constant in the far past and future and attains a minimum value at intermediate times. We construct the sugra solution to first non-trivial order in equation, and find that it is smooth, horizon free, and asymptotically equation in the far future. When the intermediate values of the dilaton becomes small enough the curvature becomes of order the string scale and the sugra approximation breaks down. The resulting dynamics is analysed in the dual SU(N) gauge theory on equation with a time dependent coupling constant which varies slowly. When equation, we find that a quantum adiabatic approximation is applicable, and use it to argue that at late times the geometry becomes smooth equation again. When equation, we formulate a classical adiabatic perturbation theory based on coherent states which arises in the large equation limit. For large values of the 'tHooft coupling this reproduces the supergravity results. For small 'tHooft coupling the coherent state calculations become involved and we cannot reach a definite conclusion. We argue that the final state should have a dual description which is mostly smooth equation space with the possible presence of a small black hole.",09,[],4

As an example, we analyze the gaugings of the six-dimensional N=(0,1) and N=(2,1) theories with identical bosonic sector and explicitly work out their scalar potentials.

0908.0737,hep-th,"We discuss various manifestations of the ""magnetic scenario"" for the quark-gluon plasma viewed as a mixture of two plasmas, of electrically (quark and gluons) as well as magnetically charged quasiparticles. Near the deconfinement phase transition, equation very small density of free quarks should lead to negligible screening of electric field while magnetic screening remains strong. The consequence of this should be existence of a ""corona"" of the QGP, in a way similar to that of the Sun, in which electric fields influence propagation of perturbations and even form metastable flux tubes. The natural tool for its description is (dual) magnetohydrodynamics: among observable consequences is splitting of sound into two modes, with larger and smaller velocity. The latter can be zero, hinting for formation of pressure-stabilized flux tubes. Remarkably, recent experimental discoveries at RHIC show effects similar to expected for ""corona structures"". In dihadron correlation function with large-equation trigger there are a ""cone"" and a ""hard ridge"",while the so called ""soft ridge"" is a similar structure seen without hard trigger.

0901.1889,hep-th,"In this work, a new ansatz is introduced to make the calculations of the metric operator in Pseudo-Hermitian field theory simpler. The idea is to assume that the metric operator is not only a functional of the field operators equation and its conjugate field equation but also on the field gradient equation. Rather than the locality of the metric operator obtained, the ansatz enables one to calculate the metric operator just once for all dimensions of the space-time. We calculated the metric operator of the equation scalar field theory up to first order in the coupling. The higher orders can be conjectured from their corresponding operators in the quantum mechanical case available in the literature. We assert that, the calculations existing in literature for the metric operator in field theory are cumbersome and are done case by case concerning the dimension of space-time in which the theory is investigated. Moreover, while the resulted metric operator in this work is local, the existing calculations for the metric operator leads to a non-local one. Indeed, we expect that the new results introduced in this work will greatly lead to the progress of the studies in Pseudo-Hermitian field theories where there exist a lack of such kind of studies in the literature.

Covariance under the SL6(Z) mapping class group of a six-torus amounts to a certain automorphic transformation law for the partition vector, which we derive. Because of the absence of a Lagrangian formulation of (2, 0) theory, this transformation property is not manifest, and gives useful non-trivial constraints on the partition vector. As an application, we derive a shifted quantization law for the spatial momentum of (2, 0) theory on a space-time of the form R x T5.

0905.2187,hep-th,"Chern-Simons models for gravity are interesting because they provide with a truly gauge-invariant action principle in the fiber-bundle sense. So far, their main drawback has largely been the perceived remoteness from standard General Relativity, based on the presence of higher powers of the curvature in the Lagrangian (except, remarkably, for three-dimensional spacetime). Here we report on a simple model that suggests a mechanism by which standard General Relativity in five-dimensional spacetime may indeed emerge at a special critical point in the space of couplings, where additional degrees of freedom and corresponding ""anomalous"" Gauss-Bonnet constraints drop out from the Chern-Simons action. To achieve this result, both the Lie algebra g and the symmetric g-invariant tensor that define the Chern-Simons Lagrangian are constructed by means of the Lie algebra S-expansion method with a suitable finite abelian semigroup S.

0902.1385,hep-th,Non-relativistic versions of the AdS/CFT conjecture have recently been investigated in some detail. These have primarily been in the context of the Schrodinger symmetry group. Here we initiate a study based on a \it different non-relativistic conformal symmetry: one obtained by a parametric contraction of the relativistic conformal group. The resulting Galilean conformal symmetry has the same number of generators as the relativistic symmetry group and thus is different from the Schrodinger group (which has fewer). One of the interesting features of the Galilean Conformal Algebra is that it admits an extension to an \it infinite dimensional symmetry algebra (which can potentially be dynamically realised). The latter contains a Virasoro-Kac-Moody subalgebra. We comment on realisations of this extended symmetry in a boundary field theory. We also propose a somewhat unusual geometric structure for the bulk gravity dual to any realisation of this symmetry. This involves taking a Newton-Cartan like limit of Einstein's equations in anti de Sitter space which singles out an equation comprising of the time and radial direction. The infinite dimensional Virasoro extension is identified with the asymptotic isometries of this equation.,09,[],4

First we exploit special algebraic properties of supergroups to compute the exact two- and three-point functions of the currents and from them we infer the current algebra. The algebra is also calculated by using conformal perturbation theory about the Wess-Zumino-Witten point and resumming the perturbation series.

0912.1263,math,"For a crystalline p-adic representation of the absolute Galois group of Qp, we define a family of Coleman maps (linear maps from the Iwasawa cohomology of the representation to the Iwasawa algebra), using the theory of Wach modules. Let f = sum(an qn) be a normalized new modular eigenform and p an odd prime at which f is either good ordinary or supersingular. By applying our theory to the p-adic representation associated to f, we define two Coleman maps with values in the Iwasawa algebra of Zp* (after extending scalars to some extension of Qp). Applying these maps to the Kato zeta elements gives a decomposition of the (generally unbounded) p-adic L-functions of f into linear combinations of two power series of bounded coefficients, generalizing works of Pollack (in the case ap=0) and Sprung (when f corresponds to a supersingular elliptic curve). Using ideas of Kobayashi for elliptic curves which are supersingular at p, we associate to each of these power series a cotorsion Selmer group. This allows us to formulate a ""main conjecture"".

0911.0920,math,"When a finite group acts linearly on a complex vector space, the natural semi-direct product of the group and the polynomial ring over the space forms a skew group algebra.

Its Hochschild cohomology predicts various Hecke algebras and deformations of the orbifold. In this article, we investigate the ring structure of the Hochschild cohomology of the skew group algebra. We show that the cup product coincides with a natural smash product, transferring the cohomology of a group action into a group action on cohomology. We express the algebraic structure of Hochschild cohomology in terms of a partial order on the group (modulo the kernel of the action). This partial order arises after assigning to each group element the codimension of its fixed point space.

The result is the generalized Langevin equation. Within this formalism, the system PSD has a simple relation to the bath PSD. We explore how several models of the bath PSD affect the system PSD. We suggest that analyzing the baseline can yield valuable information on the bath. The Debye model of acoustic bath oscillations in particular gives rise to a low frequency 1/f divergence.

It is known that ergodicity may be obtained in hard-point like collisions for specific mass ratios equation of the two particles and that Lyapunov exponents are zero. However, if a Yukawa interaction between the particles is introduced, we show analytically that positive Lyapunov exponents are generated due to double collisions close to the walls. While the largest finite-time Lyapunov exponent changes smoothly with equation, the number of occurrences of the most probable one, extracted from the distribution of finite-time Lyapunov exponents over initial conditions, reveals details about the phase-space dynamics. In particular, the influence of the integrable and pseudointegrable dynamics without Yukawa interaction for specific mass ratios can be clearly identified and demonstrates the sensitivity of the finite-time Lyapunov exponents as a phase-space probe. Being not restricted to two-dimensional problems such as Poincar\'e sections, the number of occurrences of the most probable Lyapunov exponents suggests itself as a suitable tool to characterize phase-space dynamics in higher dimensions.

The Lyapunov exponent of GLS is equal to the Shannon's entropy of the source (up to a constant of proportionality). By successively approximating the source with GLS having fewer states (with the closest Lyapunov exponent), we derive a binary coding algorithm which exhibits minimum redundancy (the least average codeword length with integer codeword lengths).

We focus on important aspects of this problem that have received little attention previously, and we explore them using experiments and simulations with the chaotic Colpitts oscillator as an example system. We explore the impact of model imperfection on the ability to extract valid information from an experimental system. We compare two optimization methods: an initial value method and a constrained method. Each of these involve coupling the model equations to the experimental data in order to regularize the chaotic motions on the synchronization manifold. We explore both time dependent and time independent coupling. We also examine both optimized and fixed (or manually adjusted) coupling. For the case of an optimized time dependent coupling function u(t) we find a robust structure which includes sharp peaks and intervals where it is zero. This structure shows a strong correlation with the location in phase space and appears to depend on noise, imperfections of the model, and the Lyapunov direction vectors. Comparison of this result with that obtained using simulated data may provide one measure of model imperfection. The constrained method with time dependent coupling appears to have benefits in synchronizing long datasets with minimal impact, while the initial value method with time independent coupling tends to be substantially faster, more flexible and easier to use. We also describe a new method of coupling which is useful for sparse experimental data sets.

0911.4353,nlin,"We present results demonstrating the occurrence of changes in the collective dynamics of a Hamiltonian system which describes a confined microplasma characterized by long--range Coulomb interactions. In its lower energy regime, we first detect macroscopically, the transition from a ""crystalline--like"" to a ""liquid--like"" behavior, which we call the ""melting transition"". We then proceed to study this transition using a microscopic chaos indicator called the \emphSmaller Alignment Index (SALI), which utilizes two deviation vectors in the tangent dynamics of the flow and is nearly constant for ordered (quasi--periodic) orbits, while it decays exponentially to zero for chaotic orbits as equation, where equation are the two largest Lyapunov exponents. During the ""melting phase"", SALI exhibits a peculiar, stair--like decay to zero, reminiscent of ""sticky"" orbits of Hamiltonian systems near the boundaries of resonance islands. This alerts us to the importance of the equation variations in that regime and helps us identify the energy range over which ""melting"" occurs as a multi--stage diffusion process through weakly chaotic layers in the phase space of the microplasma. Additional evidence supporting further the above findings is given by examining the equation indices, which generalize SALI (=equation) to the case of equation deviation vectors and depend on the complete spectrum of Lyapunov exponents of the tangent flow about the reference orbit.",09,[],9

0901.0399,nlin,"In a number of books and articles including ""The Design Inference"" and ""No Free Lunch"", W. Dembski claims to have established a robust decision process that can determine when observed structures in the natural world can be attributed to design. Dembski's decision process first asks whether a structure as an outcome can be explained by the regularity of natural laws. If not, and the outcome can be ""specified"", a randomness test is devised to determine whether an observed low probability outcome indicates design. It is argued in this paper that the Dembski test is unworkable and is better formulated in terms of a Martin Loef universal randomness test. A universal randomness test will show that most observed outcomes in the natural world are non random; they are highly ordered. However this does not necessarily demonstrate design, as the decision is not between chance and design, but between natural laws and design. The Dembski decision template, which eliminates natural processes in the first decision step, is flawed, forcing a design outcome when none is warranted. Dembski also introduces a 4th law of thermodynamics, the law of conservation of information to argue information cannot emerge from random processes. However if a more robust measure of information based on algorithmic entropy is used, the so called 4th law is seen to contain no more than the second law of thermodynamics.

0907.0324,nlin,"This current work is an extension to work previously done by the authors. The dynamics of a baby skyrmion configuration, in a model Landau-Lifshitz equation, was studied in the presence of various potential obstructions. The baby skyrmion configuration was constructed from two Q=1 hedgehog solutions to the new baby Skyrme model in equation dimensions.   The potential obstructions were created by introducing a new term into the Lagrangian which resulted in a localised inhomogeneity in the potential term's coefficient. In the barrier system the normal circular path was deformed as the skyrmions traversed the barrier, after which the skyrmions orbited the boundary of the system. For critical values of the barrier height and width the skyrmions were no longer bound although the unbound behaviour is not clearly distinct from the bound. In the case of a potential hole the dynamics of baby skyrmions is dependent upon the binding energy of the system. Depending upon its value, the skyrmions' behaviour varies. The angular momentum must be modified to ensure overall conservation. We show that there exists a link between the oscillation in the skyrmion's energy density and the periods of non-conservation of the angular momentum in Landau-Lifshitz models.",09,[],9

We show that in the regime of Shnirelman ergodicity (N>208) wave functions of the chaotic half-circular microwave ray-splitting rough billiard are extended over the whole energy surface and the amplitude distributions are Gaussian.

0901.2959,nlin,"Euler-Poincare equations are derived for the dynamical folding of charged molecular strands (such as DNA) modeled as flexible continuous filamentary distributions of interacting rigid charge conformations. The new feature is that the equations of motion for the dynamics of such molecular strands are nonlocal when the screened Coulomb interactions, or Lennard-Jones potentials between pairs of charges are included. These nonlocal dynamical equations are derived in the convective representation of continuum motion by using modified Euler-Poincare and Hamilton-Pontryagin variational formulations that illuminate the various approaches within the framework of symmetry reduction of Hamilton's principle for exact geometric rods. In the absence of nonlocal interactions, the equations recover the classical Kirchhoff theory of elastic rods in the spatial representation. The motion equations in the convective representation are shown to be affine Euler-Poincare equations relative to a certain cocycle. This property relates the geometry of the molecular strands to that of complex fluids.

0906.3647,nlin,"In many applications, the two-dimensional trajectories of fluid particles are available, but little is known about the underlying flow. Oceanic floats are a clear example. To extract quantitative information from such data, one can measure single-particle dispersion coefficients, but this only uses one trajectory at a time, so much of the information on relative motion is lost. In some circumstances the trajectories happen to remain close long enough to measure finite-time Lyapunov exponents, but this is rare. We propose to use tools from braid theory and the topology of surface mappings to approximate the topological entropy of the underlying flow. The procedure uses all the trajectory data and is inherently global. The topological entropy is a measure of the entanglement of the trajectories, and converges to zero if they are not entangled in a complex manner (for instance, if the trajectories are all in a large vortex).

0912.5242,nlin,"The diffusion of information and behaviors over social networks is of considerable interest in research fields ranging from sociology to computer science and application domains such as marketing, finance, human health, and national security. Of particular interest is the possibility to develop predictive capabilities for social diffusion, for instance enabling early identification of diffusion processes which are likely to become ""viral"" and propagate to a significant fraction of the population. Recently we have shown, using theoretical analysis, that the dynamics of social diffusion may depend crucially upon the interactions of social network communities, that is, densely connected groupings of individuals which have only relatively few links between groups. This paper presents an empirical investigation of two related hypotheses which follow from this finding: 1.) inter-community interaction is predictive of the reach of social diffusion and 2.) dispersion of the diffusion phenomenon across network communities is a useful early indicator that the propagation will be ""successful"". We explore these hypotheses with case studies involving the emergence of the Swedish Social Democratic Party at the turn of the 20th century, the spread of the SARS virus in 2002-2003, and blogging dynamics associated with real world protest activity.

These ODEs are solved analytically and numerically for the case of a constant, spatially periodic force equation. The soliton position exhibits oscillations around a mean trajectory with constant velocity. This means that the soliton performs, on the average, a unidirectional motion although the spatial average of the force vanishes. The amplitude of the oscillations is much smaller than the period of equation. In order to find out for which regions the above solutions are stable, we calculate the time evolution of the soliton momentum equation and soliton velocity equation: This is a parameter representation of a curve equation which is visited by the soliton while time evolves. Our conjecture is that the soliton becomes unstable, if this curve has a branch with negative slope. This conjecture is fully confirmed by our simulations for the perturbed NLSE.

Some synchronization criteria are firstly obtained in the form of matrix inequalities by the Lyapunov direct method, and then simplified into some algebraic inequalities by the Gerschgorin disc theorem. The relationship between the estimated synchronization error bound and system parameters reveals that the synchronization error can be controlled as small as possible by increasing the coupling strength or decreasing the magnitude of mismatch. A three-dimensional gyrostat system is chosen as an example to verify the effectiveness of these criteria, and the estimated synchronization error bounds are compared with the numerical error bounds.

The order of the transition is important when one applies the random phase approximation (RPA) to the of the Hartree-Fock wavefunction: if first order, RPA is stable through the transition, but if second-order, then the RPA amplitudes become large and lead to unphysical results. The latter is known as 'collapse' of the RPA.

The relative and neck motions are then studied and the mass parameters for these two motions are deduced. The mass parameter for the relative motion is around the reduced mass when the reaction partners are at the separated configuration and increases with decrease of the distance between two reaction partners after the touching configuration. The mass parameter for the neck motion first decreases slightly up to the touching configuration and then increases with the neck width, and its magnitude is from less than tenth to several times more than the total mass of the system. The mass parameters obtained from the microscopic transport model are larger than the ones obtained from the hydrodynamic model and smaller than those obtained from the linear response function theory.

We emphasize that the MHz radiation appears earlier than the kHz in both laboratory and geophysical scale. An important challenge in this field of research is to distinguish characteristic epochs in the evolution of precursory EM activity and identify them with the equivalent last stages in the earthquake (EQ) preparation process. Recently, we proposed the following two epochs/stages model: (i) The second epoch, which includes the finally emerged strong impulsive kHz EM emission is due to the fracture of the high strength large asperities that are distributed along the activated fault sustaining the system. (ii) The first epoch, which includes the initially emerged MHz EM radiation is thought to be due to the fracture of a highly heterogeneous system that surrounds the family of asperities. A catastrophic EQ of magnitude Mw = 6.3 occurred on 06/04/2009 in central Italy. The majority of the damage occurred in the city of L'Aquila. Clear kHz - MHz EM anomalies have been detected prior to the L'Aquila EQ. Herein, we investigate the seismogenic origin of the detected MHz anomaly. The analysis in terms of intermittent dynamics of critical fluctuations reveals that the candidate EM precursor: (i) can be described in analogy with a thermal continuous phase transition; (ii) has anti-persistent behaviour. These features suggest that the emerged candidate precursor could be triggered by microfractures in the highly disordered system that surrounded the backbone of asperities of the activated fault.

The magnetostrophic approximation often used in dynamo theory appears to be valid only for relatively high values of equation and equation. Dynamos with a minimum value of equation seem to be most readily realizable in the presence of convection columns at moderately low values of equation.

Nevertheless, physics played a significant role in Chicago, as well. That is where Fermi constructed the worlds first uranium pile under the stands of Stagg field, a site at which this author got seriously irradiated. Some curious events occurring after the bomb was dropped are also related.

Basic properties of human beings and human societies that distinguish social and natural systems from each other are listed to make it clear that individual mathematical formalism and physical notions should be developed to describe such objects rather then can be directly inherited from classical mechanics and statistical physics. As a particular example systems with motivation are considered. Their characteristic features are analyzed individually and the appropriate mathematical description is proposed.

In the presence of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), light is stored and retrieved from the sample by dynamically varying the group velocity. It is found that for any two-photon detuning of the input light pulse within the EIT transparency window, the carrier frequency of the retrieved light pulse matches the two-photon resonance frequency with the atomic ground state transition and the control field. This effect which is not based on spectral filtering is investigated both theoretically and experimentally.

Effective field goal percentages from the resulting shot attempts can be used to characterize the efficiency of each pathway. Inspired by recent discussions of the ""price of anarchy"" in traffic networks, this paper makes a formal analogy between a basketball offense and a simplified traffic network. The analysis suggests that there may be a significant difference between taking the highest-percentage shot each time down the court and playing the most efficient possible game. There may also be an analogue of Braess's Paradox in basketball, such that removing a key player from a team can result in the improvement of the team's offensive efficiency.",09,[],5

Under the assumption of baryon number conservation, such objects would take infinite time to collapse to the idealized BH state with M=0 and z=infty. The local temperature of such a stellar mass Eternally Collapsing Object (ECO) would be above Quark Gluon Phase transition. ECOs would undergo intermittent violent radiative eruptions and pollute the interstellar medium with freshly made hydrogen out of their QGP and also the light elements cooked in their envelope. It is shown that the extremely redshifted observed temperature of an ECO could be 2.75 K and superposition of ECO background radiation might generate the microwave back ground radiation.

Therefore, it is the desire of most experimentalists to minimize and possibly eliminate noise from their optical trapping experiments. A step in this direction is to quantify the actual noise in the system and to evaluate how much each particular component contributes to the overall noise. For this purpose we present Allan variance analysis as a straightforward method. In particular, it allows for judging the impact of drift which gives rise to low-frequency noise, which is extremely difficult to pinpoint by other methods.

0904.0872,physics,"In a number of natural and social systems, the response to an exogenous shock relaxes back to the average level according to a long-memory kernel equation with equation. In the presence of an epidemic-like process of triggered shocks developing in a cascade of generations at or close to criticality, this ""bare"" kernel is renormalized into an even slower decaying response function equation. Surprisingly, this means that the shorter the memory of the bare kernel (the larger equation), the longer the memory of the response function (the smaller equation). Here, we present a detailed investigation of this paradoxical behavior based on a generation-by-generation decomposition of the total response function, the use of Laplace transforms and of ""anomalous"" scaling arguments. The paradox is explained by the fact that the number of triggered generations grows anomalously with time at equation so that the contributions of active generations up to time equation more than compensate the shorter memory associated with a larger exponent equation. This anomalous scaling results fundamentally from the property that the expected waiting time is infinite for equation. The techniques developed here are also applied to the case equation and we find in this case that the total renormalized response is a \bf constant for equation followed by a cross-over to equation for equation.",09,[],5

0902.3775,physics,"We give a quantum chemical description of bridge photoisomerization reaction of green fluorescent protein (GFP) chromophores using a representation over three diabatic states. Bridge photoisomerization leads to non-radiative decay, and competes with fluorescence in these systems. In the protein, this pathway is suppressed, leading to fluorescence. Understanding the electronic structure of the photoisomerization is a prerequisite to understanding how the protein suppresses this pathway and preserves the emitting state of the chromophore. We present a solution to the state-averaged complete active space problem, which is spanned at convergence by three fragment-localized orbitals. We generate the diabatic-state representation by applying a block diagonalization transformation to the Hamiltonian calculated for the anionic chromophore model HBDI with multi-reference, multi-state perturbation theory. The diabatic states that emerge are charge-localized structures with a natural valence-bond interpretation. At planar geometries, the diabatic picture recaptures the charge transfer resonance of the anion. The strong S0-S1 excitation at these geometries is reasonably described within a two-state model, but extension to a three-state model is necessary to describe decay via two possible pathways associated with photoisomerization of the (methine) bridge. Parametric Hamiltonians based on the three-state ansatz can be fit directly to data generated using the underlying active space.

For pressure driven flow, the necessary and sufficient condition for turbulent transition is the presence of the velocity inflection point in the averaged flow. For shear driven flow, the necessary and sufficient condition for turbulent transition is the existence of zero velocity gradient in the averaged flow profile. It is shown that turbulent transition can be effected via a singularity of the energy gradient function which may be associated with the chaotic attractor in dynamic system. The role of disturbance in the transition is also clarified in causing the energy gradient function to approach the singularity. Finally, it is interesting that turbulence can be controlled by modulating the distribution of the energy gradient function.",09,[],5
0904.0243,physics,"Two-dimensional gyrokinetics is a simple paradigm for the study of kinetic magnetised plasma turbulence. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework for this turbulence. We study both the inverse and direct cascades (the `dual cascade'), driven by a homogeneous and isotropic random forcing. The key characteristic length of gyrokinetics, the Larmor radius, divides scales into two physically distinct ranges. For scales larger than the Larmor radius, we derive the familiar Charney--Hasegawa--Mima (CHM) equation from the gyrokinetic system, and explain its relationship to gyrokinetics. At scales smaller than the Larmor radius, a dual cascade occurs in phase space (two dimensions in position space plus one dimension in velocity space) via a nonlinear phase-mixing process. We show that at these sub-Larmor scales, the turbulence is self-similar and exhibits power law spectra in position and velocity space. We propose a Hankel-transform formalism to characterise velocity-space spectra. We derive the exact relations for third-order structure functions, analogous to Kolmogorov's four-fifths and Yaglom's four-thirds laws and valid at both long and short wavelengths.

Experimental data massive starts from the lowest vibrational level vA=0 of the singlet and nonuniformly cover the energy range from 10040 to 13250 cm-1 with rotational quantum numbers J from 7 to 225.

0910.5289,physics,"In this paper, we provide a theoretical description, and calculate, the nonlinear frequency shift, group velocity and collionless damping rate, equation, of a driven electron plasma wave (EPW). All these quantities, whose physical content will be discussed, are identified as terms of an envelope equation allowing one to predict how efficiently an EPW may be externally driven. This envelope equation is derived directly from Gauss law and from the investigation of the nonlinear electron motion, provided that the time and space rates of variation of the EPW amplitude, equation, are small compared to the plasma frequency or the inverse of the Debye length. equation arises within the EPW envelope equation as more complicated an operator than a plain damping rate, and may only be viewed as such because equation remains nearly constant before abruptly dropping to zero. We provide a practical analytic formula for equation and show, without resorting to complex contour deformation, that in the limit equation, equation is nothing but the Landau damping rate. We then term equation the ""nonlinear Landau damping rate"" of the driven plasma wave. As for the nonlinear frequency shift of the EPW, it is also derived theoretically and found to assume values significantly different from previously published ones, assuming that the wave is freely propagating. Moreover, we find no limitation in equation, equation being the plasma wavenumber and equation the Debye length, for a solution to the dispertion relation to exist, and want to stress here the importance of specifying how an EPW is generated to discuss its properties.

0903.0928,physics,"A local agglomeration of cooperators can support the survival or spreading of cooperation, even when cooperation is predicted to die out according to the replicator equation, which is often used in evolutionary game theory to study the spreading and disappearance of strategies. In this paper, it is shown that success-driven motion can trigger such local agglomeration and may, therefore, be used to supplement other mechanisms supporting cooperation, like reputation or punishment. Success-driven motion is formulated here as a function of the game-theoretical payoffs. It can change the outcome and dynamics of spatial games dramatically, in particular as it causes attractive or repulsive interaction forces. These forces act when the spatial distributions of strategies are inhomogeneous. However, even when starting with homogeneous initial conditions, small perturbations can trigger large inhomogeneities by a pattern-formation instability, when certain conditions are fulfilled.

Fluorescent tracer particles (2 micron diameter) allowed us to quantify the enhanced mixing caused by the swimmers, which is relevant to suspension feeding and biogenic mixing. Without swimmers present, tracer particles diffuse slowly due solely to Brownian motion. As the swimmer concentration is increased, the probability density functions (PDFs) of tracer displacements develop strong exponential tails, and the Gaussian core broadens.

The temperature dependence of equation is shown for several platforms throughout the entire temperature range: equation is nearly constant down to 1 K, where it starts to decrease smoothly. The observed behavior is thoroughly explained by considering the thermal resistances of the platform constituents. A comparison between the values of equation for platforms based on sapphire and on silver is presented where no significant difference has been observed. Each platform can be assembled to have a particular value of equation at 1 K. Since the sample relaxation time equation, equation can be adjusted to equation to give a reasonably fast measuring time: Here, it is demonstrated how this calorimeter can be used in so-called single-shot refrigerators (equationHe or demagnetization cryostats), where the time for a single measurement is limited. In addition, it can be used in moderate magnetic fields equation T, because the platform constituents are weakly field dependent.",09,[],5

0906.1202,q-bio,"Sparse coding networks, which utilize unsupervised learning to maximize coding efficiency, have successfully reproduced response properties found in primary visual cortex \citeAN:OlshausenField96. However, conventional sparse coding models require that the coding circuit can fully sample the sensory data in a one-to-one fashion, a requirement not supported by experimental data from the thalamo-cortical projection. To relieve these strict wiring requirements, we propose a sparse coding network constructed by introducing synaptic learning in the framework of compressed sensing. We demonstrate that the new model evolves biologically realistic spatially smooth receptive fields despite the fact that the feedforward connectivity subsamples the input and thus the learning has to rely on an impoverished and distorted account of the original visual data. Further, we demonstrate that the model could form a general scheme of cortical communication: it can form meaningful representations in a secondary sensory area, which receives input from the primary sensory area through a ""compressing"" cortico-cortical projection. Finally, we prove that our model belongs to a new class of sparse coding algorithms in which recurrent connections are essential in forming the spatial receptive fields.",09,[],10
0901.4448,q-bio,"This paper addresses the problem of finding cycles in the state transition graphs of synchronous Boolean networks. Synchronous Boolean networks are a class of deterministic finite state machines which are used for the modeling of gene regulatory networks. Their state transition graph cycles, called attractors, represent cell types of the organism being modeled. When the effect of a disease or a mutation on an organism is studied, attractors have to be re-computed every time a fault is injected in the model. We present an algorithm for finding attractors which uses a SAT-based bounded model checking. Novel features of the algorithm compared to the traditional SAT-based bounded model checking approaches are: (1) a termination condition which does not require an explicit computation of the diameter and (2) a technique to reduce the number of additional clauses which are needed to make paths loop-free. The presented algorithm uses much less space than existing BDD-based approaches and has a potential to handle several orders of magnitude larger networks.",09,[],10

0904.1972,q-bio,"The first passage probability (FPP), of trafficked intracellular particles reaching a displacement L, in a given time t or inverse velocity S = t/L, can be calculated robustly from measured particle tracks, and gives a measure of particle movement in which different types of motion, e.g. diffusion, ballistic motion, and transient run-rest motion, can readily be distinguished in a single graph, and compared with mathematical models. The FPP is attractive in that it offers a means of reducing the data in the measured tracks, without making assumptions about the mechanism of motion: for example, it does not employ smoothing, segementation or arbitrary thresholds to discriminate between different types of motion in a particle track. Taking experimental data from tracked endocytic vesicles, and calculating the FPP, we see how three molecular treatments affect the trafficking. We show the FPP can quantify complicated movement which is neither completely random nor completely deterministic, making it highly applicable to trafficked particles in cell biology.",09,[],10

In a pair of artificially generated phase synchronous signals the phase difference at each frequency band changes very slowly over the subsequent frequency bands.

An usefulness of this measure has been outlined in the case of cortical source localization of scalp EEG.,09,[],10
0906.3654,q-bio,"Chemotactic cells of eukaryotic organisms are able to accurately sense shallow chemical concentration gradients using cell-surface receptors. This sensing ability is remarkable as cells must be able to spatially resolve small fractional differences in the numbers of particles randomly arriving at cell-surface receptors by diffusion. An additional challenge and source of uncertainty is that particles, once bound and released, may rebind the same or a different receptor, which adds to noise without providing any new information about the environment. We recently derived the fundamental physical limits of gradient sensing using a simple spherical-cell model, but not including explicit particle-receptor kinetics. Here, we use a method based on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) to calculate the accuracy of gradient sensing by realistic receptors. We derive analytical results for two receptors, as well as two coaxial rings of receptors, e.g. one at each cell pole. For realistic receptors, we find that particle rebinding lowers the accuracy of gradient sensing, in line with our previous results.",09,[],10

This process has received much attention because disordered oligomeric aggregates have been associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Here we describe a self-templated nucleation mechanism that determines the transition between the initial condensation of polypeptide chains into disordered assemblies and their reordering into fibrillar structures. The results that we present show that at the molecular level this transition is due to the ability of polypeptide chains to reorder within oligomers into fibrillar assemblies whose surfaces act as templates that stabilise the disordered assemblies.",09,[],10

Significant reduction in genetic diversity and significant difference in genetic composition of the seedling lots compared to the seed origin stand were detected. The female and the total effective number of parents were quantified by means of maternity assignment of seedlings and temporal changes in allele frequencies. Extremely low effective maternity numbers were estimated (Nfe equation 2-4) and estimates accounting for both seed and pollen donors gave also low values (Ne equation 35-50).

Recent experimental work has unravelled the molecular regulation of the recruitment of initial signaling complexes that lead either to cell survival or death. Survival signals are activated by direct binding of TNF to TNF-R1 at the cell membrane whereas apoptotic signals by endocytosed TNF/TNF-R1 complexes. Here we investigate these aspects by developing a quantitative mathematical model of TNF binding, internalization and intracellular signaling. Model outputs compare favorably with experimental data and allow to compute TNF-mediated cytotoxicity as observed in different cell systems. We extensively study the space of parameters to show that the model is structurally stable and robust over a broad range of parameter values. Thus, our model is suitable for implementation in multi-scale simulation programs that are presently under development to study the behavior of large tumor cell populations.",09,[],10

All living organisms rely on highly efficient, specific enzymes for growth, sustenance, and reproduction; and many diseases are a consequence of a mutation on an enzyme that affects its catalytic function. It follows that the function of an enzyme affects the fitness of an organism, but just as rightfully true, the function of an enzyme affects the fitness of itself. Understanding how the complexity of enzyme structure relates to its essential function will unveil the fundamental mechanisms of evolution, and, perhaps, shed light on strategies used by ancient replicators. This paper presents evidence that supports the hypothesis that enzymes, and proteins in general, are the manifestation of the coevolution of two opposing forces. The synthesis of enzyme architecture, stability, function, evolutionary relationships, and evolvability shows that the complexity of macromolecules is a consequence of the function it provides.",09,[],10

Here, we report the real-time dynamics of the L1 stalk, a structural element of the large ribosomal subunit that is implicated in directing tRNA movements during translation. Within pre-translocation ribosomal complexes, the L1 stalk exists in a dynamic equilibrium between open and closed conformations. Binding of elongation factor G (EF-G) shifts this equilibrium towards the closed conformation through one of at least two distinct kinetic mechanisms, where the identity of the P-site tRNA dictates the kinetic route that is taken. Within post-translocation complexes, L1 stalk dynamics are dependent on the presence and identity of the E-site tRNA. Collectively, our data demonstrate that EF-G and the L1 stalk allosterically collaborate to direct tRNA translocation from the P to the E sites, and suggest a model for the release of E-site tRNA.",09,[],10

In the present study we describe and apply a method for retrieval of information about the time-course of all cell cycle phases from experimental data on the mitotic index only. We study the progression of mammalian cells through the cell cycle after exposure. The analysis reveals a prolonged block of damaged cells in the G2 phase.

0910.4015,q-bio,Why reaction rate constants for enzymatic reactions are typically inversely proportional to fractional power exponents of solvent viscosity remains to be already a thirty years old puzzle. Available interpretations of the phenomenon invoke to either a modification of 1. the conventional Kramers' theory or that of 2. the Stokes law. We show that there is an alternative interpretation of the phenomenon at which neither of these modifications is in fact indispensable. We reconcile 1. and 2. with the experimentally observable dependence. We assume that an enzyme solution in solvent with or without cosolvent molecules is an ensemble of samples with different values of the viscosity for the movement of the system along the reaction coordinate. We assume that this viscosity consists of the contribution with the weight equation from cosolvent molecules and that with the weight equation from protein matrix and solvent molecules. We introduce heterogeneity in our system with the help of a distribution over the weight equation. We verify the obtained solution of the integral equation for the unknown function of the distribution by direct substitution. All parameters of the model are related to experimentally observable values.

We model the central part of the switch and compare the two cases for PR repression: the one where the two regulators interact only on the DNA, and the other where the two regulators form a heteromer complex in the cytoplasm prior to DNA binding. The models are analyzed for bistability, and the predicted promoter repression folds are compared to experimental data. We conclude that the experimental data are best reproduced the latter case, where a heteromer complex forms in solution.

We show that the SSBR sensor and scaffold proteins poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and XRCC1 facilitate accumulation of chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1) at sites of oxidative DNA strand breakage, which in turn mediates the deposition of Histone H3.1. We also demonstrate that depletion of CAF-1 slows global rates of DNA strand break repair in quiescent cells following oxidative stress, demonstrating that single-strand break repair and histone deposition are tightly coordinated processes.

We suggest that this measure of antigenic distance could be used to guide the design of the annual flu vaccine. We combine the measure of antigenic distance with a multiple-strain avian influenza transmission model to study the threat of simultaneous introduction of multiple avian influenza strains. For H3N2 influenza, the model is validated against observed viral fixation rates and epidemic progression rates from the World Health Organization FluNet - Global Influenza Surveillance Network.

0901.3028,q-bio,"The human brain is autonomously active. To understand the functional role of this self-sustained neural activity, and its interplay with the sensory data input stream, is an important question in cognitive system research and we review here the present state of theoretical modelling.   This review will start with a brief overview of the experimental efforts, together with a discussion of transient vs. self-sustained neural activity in the framework of reservoir computing. The main emphasis will be then on two paradigmal neural network architectures showing continuously ongoing transient-state dynamics: saddle point networks and networks of attractor relics.   Self-active neural networks are confronted with two seemingly contrasting demands: a stable internal dynamical state and sensitivity to incoming stimuli. We show, that this dilemma can be solved by networks of attractor relics based on competitive neural dynamics, where the attractor relics compete on one side with each other for transient dominance, and on the other side with the dynamical influence of the input signals. Unsupervised and local Hebbian-style online learning then allows the system to build up correlations between the internal dynamical transient states and the sensory input stream. An emergent cognitive capability results from this set-up. The system performs online, and on its own, a non-linear independent component analysis of the sensory data stream, all the time being continuously and autonomously active. This process maps the independent components of the sensory input onto the attractor relics, which acquire in this way a semantic meaning.",09,[],10

In our model the genotype is presented as a set of N numbers, folding free energies of cells N proteins. Mutations occur upon replications so that stabilities of some proteins in daughter cells differ from those in parent cell by random amounts drawn from experimental distribution of mutational effects on protein stability. The genotype-phenotype relationship posits that unstable proteins confer lethal phenotype to a cell and in addition the cells fitness (duplication rate) is proportional to the concentration of its folded proteins. Simulations reveal that lethal mutagenesis occurs at mutation rates close to 7 mutations per genome per replications for RNA viruses and about half of that for DNA based organisms, in accord with earlier predictions from analytical theory and experiment. This number appears somewhat dependent on the number of genes in the organisms and natural death rate.

This deterministic model has been evaluated measuring the fraction of trophic relations correctly predicted. I contrast this value with that produced by simpler models based on body sizes and find that the data does not favor the more complex model: the information on allometric scaling and optimal foraging does not significantly increase the fit to the data. Also, I take a different approach and compute the p-value for the fraction of trophic interactions correctly predicted by ADBM with respect to three probabilistic null models.

Additionally, under weak selection, from this new process the frequency dependent Moran process is recovered. This makes it a natural extension of the usual evolutionary dynamics under weak selection. We find simple expressions for the fixation probabilities and average fixation times of the new process in evolutionary games with two players and two strategies.

0905.3690,q-bio,"There have been suggestions that heat caused by cerebral metabolic activity may constrain mammalian brain evolution, architecture, and function. This article investigates physical limits on brain wiring and corresponding changes in brain temperature that are imposed by thermodynamics of heat balance determined mainly by Naequation/Kequation-ATPase, cerebral blood flow, and heat conduction. It is found that even moderate firing rates cause significant intracellular Naequation build-up, and the ATP consumption rate associated with pumping out these ions grows nonlinearly with frequency. Surprisingly, the power dissipated by the Naequation/Kequation pump depends biphasically on frequency, which can lead to the biphasic dependence of brain temperature on frequency as well. Both the total power of sodium pumps and brain temperature diverge for very small fiber diameters, indicating that too thin fibers are not beneficial for thermal balance. For very small brains blood flow is not a sufficient cooling mechanism deep in the brain. The theoretical lower bound on fiber diameter above which brain temperature is in the operational regime is strongly frequency dependent but finite due to synaptic depression. For normal neurophysiological conditions this bound is at least an order of magnitude smaller than average values of empirical fiber diameters, suggesting that neuroanatomy of the mammalian brains operates in the thermodynamically safe regime.

0906.2171,q-bio,"Variability in neural responses is an ubiquitous phenomenon in neurons, usually modeled with stochastic differential equations. In particular, stochastic integrate-and-fire models are widely used to simplify theoretical studies. The statistical properties of the generated spikes depend on the stimulating input current. Given that real sensory neurons are driven by time-dependent signals, here we study how the inter-spike interval distribution of integrate-and-fire neurons depends on the evolution of the stimulus, in a quasi-static limit. We obtain a closed-form expression for this distribution, and we compare it to the one obtained with numerical simulations for several time-dependent currents. For slow inputs, the quasi-static distribution provides a very good description of the data. The results obtained for the integrate-and-fire model can be extended to other non-autonomous stochastic systems where the first passage time problem has an explicit solution.",09,[],10
0907.2943,q-bio,"A real-time recording setup combining exhaled breath VOC measurements by proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) with hemodynamic and respiratory data is presented. Continuous automatic sampling of exhaled breath is implemented on the basis of measured respiratory flow: a flow-controlled shutter mechanism guarantees that only end-tidal exhalation segments are drawn into the mass spectrometer for analysis.   Exhaled breath concentration profiles of two prototypic compounds, isoprene and acetone, during several exercise regimes were acquired, reaffirming and complementing earlier experimental findings regarding the dynamic response of these compounds reported by Senthilmohan et al. [1] and Karl et al. [2]. While isoprene tends to react very sensitively to changes in pulmonary ventilation and perfusion due to its lipophilic behavior and low Henry constant, hydrophilic acetone shows a rather stable behavior. Characteristic (median) values for breath isoprene concentration and molar flow, i.e., the amount of isoprene exhaled per minute are 100 ppb and 29 nmol/min, respectively, with some intra-individual day-to-day variation. At the onset of exercise breath isoprene concentration increases drastically, usually by a factor of ~3-4 within about one minute. Due to a simultaneous increase in ventilation, the associated rise in molar flow is even more pronounced, leading to a ratio between peak molar flow and molar flow at rest of ~11.   Our setup holds great potential in capturing continuous dynamics of non-polar, low-soluble VOCs over a wide measurement range with simultaneous appraisal of decisive physiological factors affecting exhalation kinetics.",09,[],10
0906.4986,q-bio,"Selection systems and the corresponding replicator equations model the evolution of replicators with a high level of abstraction. In this paper we apply novel methods of analysis of selection systems to the replicator equations. To be suitable for the suggested algorithm the interaction matrix of the replicator equation should be transformed; in particular the standard singular value decomposition allows us to rewrite the replicator equation in a convenient form. The original equation-dimensional problem is reduced to the analysis of asymptotic behavior of the solutions to the so-called escort system, which in some important cases can be of significantly smaller dimension than the original system. The Newton diagram methods are applied to study the asymptotic behavior of the solutions to the escort system, when interaction matrix has rank 1 or 2. A general replicator equation with the interaction matrix of rank 1 is fully analyzed; the conditions are provided when the asymptotic state is a polymorphic equilibrium. As an example of the system with the interaction matrix of rank 2 we consider the problem from [Adams, M.R. and Sornborger, A.T., J Math Biol, 54:357-384, 2007], for which we show, for arbitrary dimension of the system and under some suitable conditions, that generically one globally stable equilibrium exits on the 1-skeleton of the simplex.",09,[],10
0904.3308,q-bio,"We develop a model for speciation due to postzygotic incompatibility generated by autoimmune reactions. The model is based on predator-prey interactions between a host plants and their pathogens. Such interactions are often frequency-dependent, so that pathogen attack is focused on the most abundant plant phenotype, while rare plant types may escape pathogen attack. Thus, frequency dependence can generate disruptive selection, which can give rise to speciation if distant phenotypes become reproductively isolated. Based on recent experimental evidence from \it Arabidopsis, we assume that at the molecular level, incompatibility between strains is caused by epistatic interactions between two proteins in the plant immune system, the guard and the guardee. Within each plant strain, immune reactions occur when the guardee protein is modified by a pathogen effector, and the guard subsequently binds to the guardee, thus precipitating an immune response. However, when guard and guardee proteins come from phenotypically distant parents, a hybrid's immune system can be triggered by erroneous interactions between these proteins even in the absence of pathogen attack, leading to severe autoimmune reactions in hybrids. Our model shows how phenotypic variation generated by frequency-dependent host-pathogen interactions can lead to postzygotic incompatibility between extremal types, and hence to speciation.",09,[],10

A number of different models have been proposed to explain the dynamics from the underlying biochemistry. Here, we extend a previously described discrete polymer model from a deterministic to a stochastic formulation. We express the stochastic evolution of the oscillatory system as a map from the probability distribution of maximum polymer length in one period of the oscillation to the probability distribution of maximum polymer length half a period later and solve for the fixed point of the map with a combined analytical and numerical technique. This solution gives a theoretical prediction of the distributions of both lengths of the polar MinD zones and periods of oscillations -- both of which are experimentally measurable.

0910.3226,q-bio,"Recent experiments in epithelial wound healing have demonstrated the necessity of Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) for coordinated cell movement after damage. This MAPK activity is characterized by two wave-like phenomena. One MAPK ""wave"" that originates immediately after injury, propagates deep into the cell layer, and then rebounds back to the wound interface. After this initial MAPK activity has largely disappeared, a second MAPK front propagates slowly from the wound interface and continues into the tissue, maintaining a sustained level of MAPK activity throughout the cell layer. It has been suggested that the first wave is initiated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated at the time of injury. In this paper, we develop a minimal mechanistic diffusion-convection model that reproduces the observed behavior. The main ingredients of our model are a competition between ligand (e.g., Epithelial Growth Factor) and ROS for the activation of Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and a second MAPK wave that is sustained by stresses induced by the slow cell movement that closes the wound. We explore the mathematical properties of the model in connection with the bistability of the MAPK cascade and look for traveling wave solutions consistent with the experimentally observed MAPK activity patterns.",09,[],10

Recent studies in single molecule enzymology have observe this ""age-old"" dynamic disorder phenomenon directly. However, the single molecule technique has its limitation. To be able to observe this molecular effect with real biochemical functions \it in situ, we propose to couple the fluctuations in enzymatic activity to noise propagations in small protein interaction networks such as zeroth order ultra-sensitive phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle. We showed that enzyme fluctuations could indeed be amplified by orders of magnitude into fluctuations in the level of substrate phosphorylation  a quantity widely interested in cellular biology. Enzyme conformational fluctuations sufficiently slower than the catalytic reaction turn over rate result in a bimodal concentration distribution of the phosphorylated substrate. In return, this network amplified single enzyme fluctuation can be used as a novel biochemical ""reporter"" for measuring single enzyme conformational fluctuation rates.",09,[],10

There are two distinct kinds of coexistence; one with populations distributed homogeneously in space and another one with spatiotemporal patterns. In the latter case, there are noise-sustained oscillations in the population densities, whereas in the former one the densities are essentially constants in time with small fluctuations. We introduce several metrics to characterize the patterns and onset thereof. We also build a consistent sequence of corrections to the mean-field equations using a posteriori knowledge from simulations. These corrections both lead to better description of the dynamics and connect the patterns to it.

0912.5409,q-bio,"Ising models with pairwise interactions are the least structured, or maximum-entropy, probability distributions that exactly reproduce measured pairwise correlations between spins. Here we use this equivalence to construct Ising models that describe the correlated spiking activity of populations of 40 neurons in the salamander retina responding to natural movies. We show that pairwise interactions between neurons account for observed higher-order correlations, and that for groups of 10 or more neurons pairwise interactions can no longer be regarded as small perturbations in an independent system. We then construct network ensembles that generalize the network instances observed in the experiment, and study their thermodynamic behavior and coding capacity. Based on this construction, we can also create synthetic networks of 120 neurons, and find that with increasing size the networks operate closer to a critical point and start exhibiting collective behaviors reminiscent of spin glasses. We examine closely two such behaviors that could be relevant for neural code: tuning of the network to the critical point to maximize the ability to encode diverse stimuli, and using the metastable states of the Ising Hamiltonian as neural code words.",09,[],10
0903.2997,q-bio,"Epidemic models with inhomogeneous populations have been used to study major outbreaks and recently Britton and Lindenstrand \citeBL described the case when latency and infectivity have independent gamma distributions. They found that variability in these random variables had opposite effects on the epidemic growth rate. That rate increased with greater variability in latency but decreased with greater variability in infectivity. Here we extend their result by using the McKay bivariate gamma distribution for the joint distribution of latency and infectivity, recovering the above effects of variability but allowing possible correlation. We use methods of stochastic rate processes to obtain explicit solutions for the growth of the epidemic and the evolution of the inhomogeneity and information entropy. We obtain a closed analytic solution to the evolution of the distribution of the number of uninfected individuals as the epidemic proceeds, and a concomitant expression for the decay of entropy. The family of McKay bivariate gamma distributions has a tractable information geometry which provides a framework in which the evolution of distributions can be studied as the outbreak grows, with a natural distance structure for quantitative tracking of progress.",09,[],10

Traditional imaging is hindered due to low signal to noise ratios at individual voxels. We propose to minimize the total variation of the tracer uptake rates while requiring good fit of traditional Patlak equations.

Brain phantom simulations demonstrate significant improvement in quality of images by the proposed method as compared to Patlak images with post-filtering using Gaussian or median filters.,09,[],10
0912.2531,q-bio,"Biochemical and regulatory interactions central to biological networks are expected to cause extensive genetic interactions or epistasis affecting the heritability of complex traits and the distribution of genotypes in populations. However, the inference of epistasis from the observed phenotype-genotype correlation is impeded by statistical difficulties, while the theoretical understanding of the effects of epistasis remains limited, in turn limiting our ability to interpret data. Of particular interest is the biologically relevant situation of numerous interacting genetic loci with small individual contributions to fitness. Here, we present a computational model of selection dynamics involving many epistatic loci in a recombining population. We demonstrate that a large number of polymorphic interacting loci can, despite frequent recombination, exhibit cooperative behavior that locks alleles into favorable genotypes leading to a population consisting of a set of competing clones. When the recombination rate exceeds a certain critical value that depends on the strength of epistasis, this ""genotype selection"" regime disappears in an abrupt transition, giving way to ""allele selection""-the regime where different loci are only weakly correlated as expected in sexually reproducing populations. We show that large populations attain highest fitness at a recombination rate just below critical. Clustering of interacting sets of genes on a chromosome leads to the emergence of an intermediate regime, where blocks of cooperating alleles lock into genetic modules. These haplotype blocks disappear in a second transition to pure allele selection. Our results demonstrate that the collective effect of many weak epistatic interactions can have dramatic effects on the population structure.",09,[],10

In addition, like in the FR theory, the profile CRF can incorporate long-range pairwise interactions between model states via mean-field-like approximations. We give the detailed formulation of the model, self-consistent approximations for treating long-range interactions, and algorithms for computing partition functions and marginal probabilities.

0903.2960,q-bio,"Background: Hybridogenesis is a very interesting example of reproduction which seems to integrate the sexual and clonal processes in one system. In a case of frogs, described in the paper, two parental species - Rana lessonae and Rana ridibunda can form fertile hybrid individuals - Rana esculenta. Hybrid individuals eliminate one parental haplotype from their germ line cells before meiosis (end before recombination) which implicates clonal reproduction of the haplotype transferred to the gametes. All three ""species"" are called ""complex species"". To study the evolution of genomes in the hybridogenetic fraction of this complex species we have used the Monte Carlo based model rendering the age structured populations. The model enables the analysis of distribution of defective alleles in the individual genomes as well as in the genetic pool of the whole populations.   Results: We have shown that longer isolation of hybrids' populations leads to the speciation through emerging the specific sets of complementing haplotypes in their genetic pool. The fraction of defective alleles increases but the defects are complemented in the heterozygous loci. Nevertheless, even small supply of new hybrids generated by the two parental species or crossbreeding between hybrids and one of the parental species prevents the speciation and changes the strategy of the genome evolution from the complementing to the purifying Darwinian selection.",09,[],10

Based on these observations, we formulate a conjecture governing which populations of complex food webs can be grouped together into a single variable without changing the local dynamics. As an illustration we use this conjecture to show that chaotic regions generically exist in the parameter space of a class of food webs with more than three trophic levels.

0907.0073,q-bio,"Proteins are regularly described with some general indices (mass fractal dimension, surface fractal dimension, entropy, enthalpy, free energies, hydrophobicity, denaturation temperature etc..), which are inherently statistical in nature. These general indices emerge from innumerable (innately context-dependent and time-dependent) interactions between various atoms of a protein. Many a studies have been performed on the nature of these inter-atomic interactions and the change of profile of atomic fluctuations that they cause. However, we still do not know, under a given context, for a given duration of time, how does a macroscopic biophysical property emerge from the cumulative inter-atomic interactions. An exact answer to that question will involve bridging the gap between nano-scale distinguishable atomic description and macroscopic indistinguishable (statistical) measures, along the mesoscopic scale of observation. In this work we propose a computationally implementable mathematical model that derives expressions for observability of emergence of a macroscopic biophysical property from a set of interacting (fluctuating) atoms.

Populations survived due to retaining some surplus of genetic information in the individual genomes. The changes of the environment caused the fluctuations of the population size.

This makes our metric widely applicable. The simulation experiments carried out shows that the new metric, when defined under classical models such as the JC, F84 and Kimura-2-parameter models, performs better than these existing metrics in recovering phylogenetic trees from sequence data.

It combines ideas from several known theoretical algorithms for phylogenetic tree and network reconstruction with two novel subroutines. Namely, an exponential-time exact and a greedy algorithm both of which are of independent theoretical interest. Most importantly, LEV1ATHAN runs in polynomial time and always constructs a level-1 network. If the data is consistent with a phylogenetic tree, then the algorithm constructs such a tree. Moreover, if the input triplet set is dense and, in addition, is fully consistent with some level-1 network, it will find such a network.

In this way a formulation which is a series of very simple, first order, ordinary differential equations is devised. The model is extended to include a variety of Glossina species using their relative surface areas, their relative pupal and puparial loss rates and their different 4th instar excretions. The resulting computational model calculates total, pupal water loss, consequent mortality and emergence. Remaining fat reserves are a more tenuous result.   The model suggests that, while conventional wisdom is often correct in dismissing variability in transpiration-related pupal mortality as insignificant, the effects of transpiration can be profound under adverse conditions and for some species, in general.

The model therefore takes into account the fact that new additions to the adult fly population are, in actual fact, the descendents of a population which existed one puparial duration ago, furthermore, that this puparial duration is temperature dependent. Artificially imposed mortality is modelled as a proportion at a constant rate. Fisher's equation is also solved as a formality.   The temporary imposition of a 2 % equation mortality everywhere outside the reserve for a period of 2 years will have no lasting effect on the influence of the reserve on either the Glossina austeni or the G. brevipalpis populations, although it certainly will eradicate tsetse from poor habitat, outside the reserve. A 5 equation-wide barrier with a minimum mortality of 4 % equation, throughout, will succeed in isolating a worst-case, G. austeni population and its associated trypanosomiasis from the surrounding areas. A more optimistic estimate of its mobility suggests a mortality of 2 % equation will suffice. For a given target-related mortality, more mobile species are found to be more vulnerable to eradication than more sedentary species, while the opposite is true for containment.",09,[],10
0912.1275,quant-ph,"According to the identity principle in quantum theory, states of a system consisted of identical particles should maintain unchanged under interchanging between two of the particles. The whole wavefunction should be symmetrized or antisymmetrized. This leads to statistical correlations between particles, which exhibit observable effects. We design an experiment to directly observe such effects for bosons. The experiment is performed with two photons. The effect of statistical correlations is clearly observed when the wavepackets of two photons are completely overlapped, and this effect varies with the degree of overlapping.

The wave function proposed by Chandrasekhar is revisited, where the permutation symmetry is first broken and then restored by a counter-term. More delicate problems can be studied using the same strategy: the stability of hydrogen-like ions equation for any value of the proton-to-electron mass ratio equation; the energy of the lowest spin-triplet state of helium and helium-like ions; the stability of the doubly-excited hydrogen ion with unnatural parity.

Two examples including a two-level system and a three-level system are presented to demonstrate the proposed SMC method.

Still, the general form of the state operators of ME packets is obtained with its help. The diagonal representation of the operators is found. A general way of calculating averages that can replace the partition function method is described. Classical mechanics is reinterpreted as a statistical theory. Classical trajectories are replaced by classical ME packets. Quantum states approximate classical ones if the product of the coordinate and momentum variances is much larger than Planck constant.

Here we propose a novel approach to this problem, in which optically levitating a nano-mechanical system can greatly reduce its thermal contact, while simultaneously eliminating dissipation arising from clamping. Through the long coherence times allowed, this approach potentially opens the door to ground-state cooling and coherent manipulation of a single mesoscopic mechanical system or entanglement generation between spatially separate systems, even in room temperature environments.

0910.3850,quant-ph,"The three major theoretical principles of quantum mechanics relevant to its interpretation are: (T1), linearity; (T2), invariance under certain groups; and (T3) the orthogonality and isolation of the different branches of the state vector. These three imply the particle-like properties of mass, energy, momentum, spin, charge, and locality are actually properties of the state vector; and this in turn implies there is no evidence for the existence of particles. Experimentally there is no evidence for collapse (E1) and theoretically linearity prohibits collapse. One also has the experimentally verified probability law (E2), which is found to rule out the many-worlds interpretation. The failure of these three major interpretation, particles, collapse, and many-worlds, apparently implies an acceptable interpretation must be based on perception. Rather than being a separate principle, probability follows in this interpretation from a weak assumption on perception plus the combinatorics when an experiment is run many times.

Inspired by these results, we present a simple model in which a driven nanomechanical resonator mode modulates the excitation energy of coupled quantum dots and find that this can indeed lead to an enhancement in the transport of excitations across the quantum network. Disorder of the on-site energies is a key requirement for this to occur.

We argue that classical physics corresponds to the factual aspects of reality and requires a categorical framework which consists of four interdependent components: boolean logic, the linear-sequential notion of time, the principle of sufficient reason, and the dichotomy between observer and observed. None of these can be dropped without affecting the others. However, in quantum theory the reduction postulate also addresses the ""status nascendi"" of facts, i.e., their coming into being. Therefore, quantum phyics requires a different conceptual framework which will be elaborated in this article.

0911.2500,quant-ph,"I apply some of the lessons from quantum theory, in particular from Bell's theorem, to a debate on the foundations of decision theory and causation. By tracing a formal analogy between the basic assumptions of Causal Decision Theory (CDT)--which was developed partly in response to Newcomb's problem-- and those of a Local Hidden Variable (LHV) theory in the context of quantum mechanics, I show that an agent who acts according to CDT and gives any nonzero credence to some possible causal interpretations underlying quantum phenomena should bet against quantum mechanics in some feasible game scenarios involving entangled systems, no matter what evidence they acquire. As a consequence, either the most accepted version of decision theory is wrong, or it provides a practical distinction, in terms of the prescribed behaviour of rational agents, between some metaphysical hypotheses regarding the causal structure underlying quantum mechanics.",09,[],6
0911.0695,quant-ph,"Quantum theory makes the most accurate empirical predictions and yet it lacks simple, comprehensible physical principles from which the theory can be uniquely derived. A broad class of probabilistic theories exist which all share some features with quantum theory, such as probabilistic predictions for individual outcomes (indeterminism), the impossibility of information transfer faster than speed of light (no-signaling) or the impossibility of copying of unknown states (no-cloning). A vast majority of attempts to find physical principles behind quantum theory either fall short of deriving the theory uniquely from the principles or are based on abstract mathematical assumptions that require themselves a more conclusive physical motivation. Here, we show that classical probability theory and quantum theory can be reconstructed from three reasonable axioms: (1) (Information capacity) All systems with information carrying capacity of one bit are equivalent. (2) (Locality) The state of a composite system is completely determined by measurements on its subsystems. (3) (Reversibility) Between any two pure states there exists a reversible transformation. If one requires the transformation from the last axiom to be continuous, one separates quantum theory from the classical probabilistic one. A remarkable result following from our reconstruction is that no probability theory other than quantum theory can exhibit entanglement without contradicting one or more axioms.",09,[],6
0910.4543,quant-ph,"We investigate the properties of an atmospheric channel for free space quantum communication with continuous polarization variables. In our prepare-and-measure setup, coherent polarization states are transmitted through an atmospheric quantum channel of 100m length on the roof of our institute's building. The signal states are measured by homodyne detection with the help of a local oscillator (LO) which propagates in the same spatial mode as the signal, orthogonally polarized to it. Thus the interference of signal and LO is excellent and atmospheric fluctuations are autocompensated. The LO also acts as spatial and spectral filter, which allows for unrestrained daylight operation. Important characteristics for our system are atmospheric channel influences that could cause polarization, intensity and position excess noise. Therefore we study these influences in detail. Our results indicate that the channel is suitable for our quantum communication system in most weather conditions.",09,[],6

This means equivalence classes of states under ILO can be determined in a systematic way for an arbitrary number of qubits.

We then study the two main examples of topological stabilizer codes in arbitrary dimensions and establish their self-correcting capabilities. Also, we address the transversality properties of topological color codes, showing that 6D color codes provide a self-correcting model that allows the transversal and local implementation of a universal set of operations in seven spatial dimensions.

0905.1149,quant-ph,"A quantum control landscape is defined as the expectation value of a target observable equation as a function of the control variables. In this work control landscapes for open quantum systems governed by Kraus map evolution are analyzed. Kraus maps are used as the controls transforming an initial density matrix equation into a final density matrix to maximize the expectation value of the observable equation. The absence of suboptimal local maxima for the relevant control landscapes is numerically illustrated. The dependence of the optimization search effort is analyzed in terms of the dimension of the system equation, the initial state equation, and the target observable equation. It is found that if the number of nonzero eigenvalues in equation remains constant, the search effort does not exhibit any significant dependence on equation. If equation has no zero eigenvalues, then the computational complexity and the required search effort rise with equation. The dimension of the top manifold (i.e., the set of Kraus operators that maximizes the objective) is found to positively correlate with the optimization search efficiency. Under the assumption of full controllability, incoherent control modelled by Kraus maps is found to be more efficient in reaching the same value of the objective than coherent control modelled by unitary maps. Numerical simulations are also performed for control landscapes with linear constraints on the available Kraus maps, and suboptimal maxima are not revealed for these landscapes.",09,[],6

Especially as our model almost makes it possible in principle to calculate the full history of the universe, it even makes it in principle calculable, which one among several measurement results in a quantum experiment will actually be realized!   Our ""complex action model"" thus is a special case of superdeterminism - in Bells way - and does not have true causality, but rather even in some cases true backward causation.

0910.5937,quant-ph,"The problem of infrared divergence of the effective electromagnetic field at finite temperature (T) is revisited. A model of single spatially localized electron interacting with thermal photons is considered in the limit T to 0 using two different regularization schemes. The first is based on the shift i 0 to i varepsilon of the electron propagator pole in the complex energy plane, and is used to explicitly calculate the effective field in the one-loop approximation. We show that the matrix-valued imaginary part of the electron self-energy can be consistently related to the pole shift, and that the presence of the heat bath leads to appearance of an effective varepsilon sim T, thus providing a natural infrared regulator of the theory. We find that the one-loop effective Coulomb field calculated using this varepsilon vanishes. The other scheme combines an infrared momentum cutoff with smearing of the delta-functions in the interaction vertices. We prove that this regularization admits factorization of the infrared contributions in multi-loop diagrams, and sum the corresponding infinite series. The effective electromagnetic field is found to vanish in this case too. An essentially perturbative nature of this result is emphasized and discussed in connection with the long-range expansion of the effective field.",09,[],6

Dynamics of population inversion and atom-field entanglement are studied taking the initial state of the field to be either a coherent state or a squeezed vacuum. Analysis is extended to the case of a two-mode cavity field interacting with a two-level atom. For the two-mode case, the initial field is a pair coherent state or a two-mode squeezed vacuum.

0906.2686,quant-ph,"In a large-scale quantum computer, the cost of communications will dominate the performance and resource requirements, place many severe demands on the technology, and constrain the architecture. Unfortunately, fault-tolerant computers based entirely on photons with probabilistic gates, though equipped with ""built-in"" communication, have very large resource overheads; likewise, computers with reliable probabilistic gates between photons or quantum memories may lack sufficient communication resources in the presence of realistic optical losses. Here, we consider a compromise architecture, in which semiconductor spin qubits are coupled by bright laser pulses through nanophotonic waveguides and cavities using a combination of frequent probabilistic and sparse determinstic entanglement mechanisms. The large photonic resource requirements incurred by the use of probabilistic gates for quantum communication are mitigated in part by the potential high-speed operation of the semiconductor nanophotonic hardware.

In Refs. \citePST,psd, respectively, PST of a qubit over distance regular spin networks and optimal state transfer (ST) of a equation-level quantum state (qudit) over pseudo distance regular networks were discussed, where the networks considered there were not in general related with a certain finite group. In this paper, PST of a qudit over antipodes of more general networks called underlying networks of association schemes, is investigated. In particular, we consider the underlying networks of group association schemes in order to employ the group properties (such as irreducible characters) and use the algebraic structure of these networks (such as Bose-Mesner algebra) in order to give an explicit analytical formula for coupling constants in the Hamiltonians so that the state of a particular qudit initially encoded on one site will perfectly evolve to the opposite site without any dynamical control. It is shown that the only necessary condition in order to PST over these networks be achieved is that the centers of the corresponding groups be non-trivial.

The public version of the catalog will be made available through the CDS services along with the ongoing RAVE public data releases.   The distances are determined with a method based on the work by Breddels et al.~(2010). Here we assume that the star undergoes a standard stellar evolution and that its spectrum shows no peculiarities. The refinements include: the use of either of the three isochrone sets, a better account of the stellar ages and masses, use of more realistic errors of stellar parameter values, and application to a larger dataset. The derived distances of both dwarfs and giants match within ~21% to the astrometric distances of Hipparcos stars and to the distances of observed members of open and globular clusters. Multiple observations of a fraction of RAVE stars show that repeatability of the derived distances is even better, with half of the objects showing a distance scatter of \simlt 11%.   RAVE dwarfs are ~300 pc from the Sun, and giants are at distances of 1 to 2 kpc, and up to 10 kpc.

Both outflows are assumed to be purely radial. We adopt a novel approach to describe the dust formation site in the wind that employs timescale arguments for grain condensation and a self-consistent solution for the dust destruction surface.

1008.1075,astro-ph,"We study the behaviour of multiple radiative cooling algorithms implemented in seven Semi-Analytic Models (SAMs) of galaxy formation, including a new model we propose in this paper. We use versions of the models without feedback and apply them to dark matter haloes growing in a cosmological context, which have final masses that range from 1011Msun to 1014Msun. First, using simplified smoothly-growing halo models, we demonstrate that the different algorithms predict cooling rates and final cold gas masses that differ by a factor of ~5 for massive haloes (>1012Msun). The algorithms are in better agreement for less massive haloes because they cool efficiently and, therefore, their cooling rates are largely limited by the halo accretion rate. However, for less massive haloes, all the SAMs predict less cooling than corresponding 1D hydrodynamic models. Second, we study the gas accretion history of the central galaxies of dark matter haloes using merger trees. The inclusion of mergers alters the cooling history of haloes by locking up gas in galaxies within small haloes at early times. For realistic halo models, the dispersion in the cold gas mass predicted by the algorithms is 0.5 dex for high mass haloes and 0.1 dex for low mass haloes, while the dispersion in the accretion rate is about two times larger. Comparing to cosmological SPH simulations, we find that most SAMs systematically under-predict the gas accretion rates for low-mass haloes but over-predict the gas accretion rates for massive haloes. Although the models all include both ""rapid"" and ""slow"" mode accretion, the transition between the two accretion modes varies between models and also differs from the simulations. Finally, we construct a new model that explicitly incorporates cold halo gas to illustrate that such a class of models can better match the results from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations.",10,[],1

The achieved single-epoch precisions of our observations are about 0.1 mas and the data showed no significant residual trend, while the presence of the planet should have induced an apparent proper motion larger than 10 mas/yr. Subtraction of the predicted orbital motion from the observed data produces a large trend in position residuals of VB 10. We estimated the probability that this trend is caused by random noise.

In order to extract the gravitational waveforms, we present a stress formula including contributions both from magnetic fields and special relativistic corrections. By changing the precollapse magnetic fields and initial angular momentum distributions parametrically, we compute twelve models. As for the microphysics, a realistic equation of state is employed and the neutrino cooling is taken into account via a multiflavor neutrino leakage scheme.   With these computations, we find that the total GW amplitudes show a monotonic increase after bounce for models with a strong precollapse magnetic field (equationG) also with a rapid rotation imposed.   We show that this trend stems both from the kinetic contribution of MHD outflows with large radial velocities and also from the magnetic contribution dominated by the toroidal magnetic fields that predominantly trigger MHD explosions. For models with weaker initial magnetic fields, the total GW amplitudes after bounce stay almost zero, because the contribution from the magnetic fields cancels with the one from the hydrodynamic counterpart.

1010.5369,astro-ph,"Mass loss of red supergiants (RSG) is important for the evolution of massive stars, but is not fully explained. Several empirical prescriptions have been proposed, trying to express the mass-loss rate (Mdot) as a function of fundamental stellar parameters (mass, luminosity, effective temperature). Our goal is to test whether the de Jager et al. (1988) prescription, used in some stellar evolution models, is still valid in view of more recent mass-loss determinations. By considering 40 Galactic RSGs presenting an infrared excess and an IRAS 60-mu flux larger than 2 Jy, and assuming a gas-to-dust mass ratio of 200, it is found that the de Jager rate agrees within a factor 4 with most Mdot estimates based on the 60-mu signal. It is also in agreement with 6 of the only 8 Galactic RSGs for which Mdot can be measured more directly through observations of the circumstellar gas. The two objects that do not follow the de Jager prescription (by an order of magnitude) are mu Cep and NML Cyg. We have also considered the RSGs of the Magellanic Clouds. Thanks to the works of Groenewegen et al. (2009) and Bonanos et al. (2010), we find that the RSGs of the SMC have Mdots consistent with the de Jager rate scaled by (Z/Zsun)**(alpha), where Z is the metallicity and alpha is 0.7. The situation is less clear for the LMC RSGs. In particular, for luminosties larger than 1.6E05 Lsun, one finds numerous RSGs (except WOH-G64) having Mdot significantly smaller than the de Jager rate, and indicating that Mdot would no longer increase with L. Before this odd situation is confirmed through further analysis of LMC RSGs, we suggest to keep the de Jager prescription unchanged at solar metallicity in the stellar evolutionary models and to apply a (Z/Zsun)**0.7 dependence.",10,[],1

1010.1450,astro-ph,"We studied a steadily accreting, geometrically thick disk model that selfconsistently takes into account selfgravitation of the polytropic gas, its interaction with the radiation and the mass accretion rate. The accreting mass is injected inward in the vicinity of the central equation plane, where also radiation is assumed to be created. The rest of the disk remains approximately stationary. Only conservation laws are employed and the gas-radiation interaction in the bulk of the disk is described in the thin-gas approximation. We demonstrate that this scheme is numerically viable and yields a structure of the bulk that is influenced by the radiation and (indirectly) by the prescribed mass accretion rate. The obtained disk configurations are typical for environments in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), with the central mass of the order of equation to equation, quasi-Keplerian rotation curves, disk masses ranging from about equation to equation, and the luminosity ranging from equation to equation.

In general we find that the decrease in scatter letter is well approximated by lettermerg(m) = letterini \times (m  1)(-a/2) with a = 0.42 for a range of mean number of mergers m < 50. For a large mean number of mergers (m > 100) we find a convergence to a = 0.61. This is valid for a wide range of different initial distributions, refill-scenarios or merger mass-ratios. Growth scenarios based on halo merger trees of a (100 Mpc)3 dark matter LambdaCDM-simulation show a similar behaviour with a scatter decrease of a = 0.30 with typical number of mergers m < 50 consistent with random merging (best matching model: a = 0.34). Assuming a present day scatter of 0.3 dex in black hole mass and a mean number of mergers not exceeding m = 50 our results imply a scatter of 0.6 dex at z = 3 and thus a possible scenario in which overmassive (and undermassive) black holes at high redshift are a consequence of a larger intrinsic scatter in black hole mass. A simple toy model connecting the growth of black holes to the growth of LambdaCDM dark matter halos via mergers, neglecting any contribution from accretion, yields a consistent M\cdot -MBulge relation at z = 0 - if we assume the correct initial relation.",10,[],1
1005.5198,astro-ph,"To assess how future progress in gravitational microlensing computation at high optical depth will rely on both hardware and software solutions, we compare a direct inverse ray-shooting code implemented on a graphics processing unit (GPU) with both a widely-used hierarchical tree code on a single-core CPU, and a recent implementation of a parallel tree code suitable for a CPU-based cluster supercomputer. We examine the accuracy of the tree codes through comparison with a direct code over a much wider range of parameter space than has been feasible before. We demonstrate that all three codes present comparable accuracy, and choice of approach depends on considerations relating to the scale and nature of the microlensing problem under investigation. On current hardware, there is little difference in the processing speed of the single-core CPU tree code and the GPU direct code, however the recent plateau in single-core CPU speeds means the existing tree code is no longer able to take advantage of Moore's law-like increases in processing speed. Instead, we anticipate a rapid increase in GPU capabilities in the next few years, which is advantageous to the direct code. We suggest that progress in other areas of astrophysical computation may benefit from a transition to GPUs through the use of ""brute force"" algorithms, rather than attempting to port the current best solution directly to a GPU language -- for certain classes of problems, the simple implementation on GPUs may already be no worse than an optimised single-core CPU version.",10,[],1
1010.0856,astro-ph,"We report the detection of three new extrasolar planets orbiting the solar type stars HD 85390, HD 90156 and HD 103197 with the HARPS spectrograph mounted on the ESO 3.6-m telescope at La Silla observatory. HD 85390 has a planetary companion with a projected intermediate mass (42.0 Earth masses) on a 788-day orbit (a=1.52 AU) with an eccentricity of 0.41, for which there is no analogue in the solar system. A drift in the data indicates the presence of another companion on a long period orbit, which is however not covered by our measurements. HD 90156 is orbited by a warm Neptune analogue with a minimum mass of 17.98 Earth masses (1.05 Neptune masses), a period of 49.8 days (a=0.25 AU) and an eccentricity of 0.31. HD 103197 has an intermediate mass planet on a circular orbit (P=47.8 d, Msini=31.2 Earth masses). We discuss the formation of planets of intermediate mass (about 30-100 Earth masses) which should be rare inside a few AU according to core accretion formation models.",10,[],1
1011.4171,astro-ph,"Examination of ambient thermodynamic conditions suggest that clathrate hydrates could exist in the martian permafrost, on the surface and in the interior of Titan, as well as in other icy satellites. Clathrate hydrates probably formed in a significant fraction of planetesimals in the solar system. Thus, these crystalline solids may have been accreted in comets, in the forming giant planets and in their surrounding satellite systems. In this work, we use a statistical thermodynamic model to investigate the composition of clathrate hydrates that may have formed in the primordial nebula. In our approach, we consider the formation sequence of the different ices occurring during the cooling of the nebula, a reasonable idealization of the process by which volatiles are trapped in planetesimals. We then determine the fractional occupancies of guests in each clathrate hydrate formed at given temperature. The major ingredient of our model is the description of the guest-clathrate hydrate interaction by a spherically averaged Kihara potential with a nominal set of parameters, most of which being fitted on experimental equilibrium data. Our model allows us to find that Kr, Ar and Nequation can be efficiently encaged in clathrate hydrates formed at temperatures higher than equation 48.5 K in the primitive nebula, instead of forming pure condensates below 30 K. However, we find at the same time that the determination of the relative abundances of guest species incorporated in these clathrate hydrates strongly depends on the choice of the parameters of the Kihara potential and also on the adopted size of cages. Indeed, testing different potential parameters, we have noted that even minor dispersions between the different existing sets can lead to non-negligible variations in the determination of the volatiles trapped in clathrate hydrates formed in the primordial nebula.",10,[],1
1005.3874,astro-ph,We present images of extended H-alpha clouds associated with 14 member galaxies in the Coma cluster obtained from deep narrow band imaging observations with Suprime-Cam at the Subaru Telescope. The parent galaxies of the extended H-alpha clouds are distributed farther than 0.2 Mpc from the peak of X-ray emission of the cluster. Most of the galaxies have colors bluer than g-r approx 0.5 and they account for 57% of the blue (g-r<0.5) bright (r<17.8 mag) galaxies in the central region of the Coma cluster. They reside near the red- and blue-shifted edges of the Coma cluster's radial velocity distribution. These findings suggest that the most of the parent galaxies were recently captured by the Coma cluster potential and are now infalling toward the cluster center with their disk gas being stripped off and producing the observed H-alpha clouds.,10,[],1
1010.5390,astro-ph,"The generic acceleration model for ultra high energy cosmic rays, which has been introduced in \tt 1006.5708 [astro-ph.HE], suggests various types of electromagnetic interactions between cosmic charged particles and the different types of the plasma fields, which are assumed to have general configurations, spatially and temporally. The well-known Fermi acceleration mechanisms are also included in the model. Meanwhile Fermi mechanisms in non-relativistic limit adhere first- and second-order of equation, the ratio of particle's velocity relative to the velocity of the stellar magnetic cloud, in the plasma field sector, equation does not play any role, i.e. zero-order. In the relativistic limit, the orders of Fermi acceleration are only possible, when applying the corresponding conditions, either elastic scatterings or shock waves. Furthermore, it is found that the coefficients of equation are functions of the initial and final velocities and the characteristic Larmor radius.",10,[],1
1006.2159,astro-ph,"A smooth inflaton potential is generally assumed when calculating the primordial power spectrum, implicitly assuming that a very small oscillation in the inflaton potential creates a negligible change in the predicted halo mass function. We show that this is not true. We find that a small oscillating perturbation in the inflaton potential in the slow-roll regime can alter significantly the predicted number of small halos. A class of models derived from supergravity theories gives rise to inflaton potentials with a large number of steps and many transplanckian effects may generate oscillations in the primordial power spectrum. The potentials we study are the simple quadratic (chaotic inflation) potential with superimposed small oscillations for small field values. Without leaving the slow-roll regime, we find that for a wide choice of parameters, the predicted number of halos change appreciably. For the oscillations beginning in the 107-108 solar masses range, for example, we find that only a 5% change in the amplitude of the chaotic potential causes a 50% suppression of the number of halos for masses between 107-108 solar masses and an increase in the number of halos for masses <106 solar masses by factors ~15-50. We suggest that this might be a solution to the problem of the lack of observed dwarf galaxies in the range 107-108 solar masses. This might also be a solution to the reionization problem where a very large number of Population III stars in low mass halos are required.",10,[],1
1001.1943,astro-ph,"We present the discovery of a large-scale structure of emission-line galaxies at redshift z=4.86 behind a massive cluster of galaxies, A1689. Previous spectroscopic observations of a galaxy, A1689-7.1 at z=4.87, near this structure, revealed a possible overdense region of inter-galactic medium (IGM) around the galaxy, which extends at least ~80 comoving Mpc along the line of sight. In order to investigate whether this z~5 IGM overdense region contains a galaxy overdensity, we undertook narrow- and broad-band imaging observations around A1689-7.1 with Subaru/Suprime-Cam. We detected 51 candidate Ly-alpha emitters at redshift z=4.86-0.03 in the 32 x 24 arcmin2 field of view. After correction for lensing by the foreground cluster, we found a large-scale (~20 x 60 comoving Mpc) overdense region of galaxies around A1689-7.1 in the source plane at z=4.86. The densest peak in this region has an overdensity of delta~4, suggesting that this structure is probably a good candidate for a protocluster. A1689-7.1 is located at the edge of this region, where the local galaxy density is ~1.6 times the mean density and is close to the density contrast in the IGM along the line of sight to A1689-7.1 estimated from the optical depth. The overdensities of galaxies we have found may suggest that at least some parts of the IGM overdense region have already started to form galaxies and moreover they relate to the formation of a protocluster. Although we lack information on the three dimensional distributions of both IGM and galaxy overdense regions, the similarity of the scales of both regions may suggest that the two are parts of a single large-scale structure, which would be an large edge-on sheet along the line of sight with a size of ~20 x 60 x 80 comoving Mpc.",10,[],1
1010.5243,astro-ph,"Based on previous spectral and temporal optical studies, Q2122-444 has been classified as a naked AGN or true type 2 AGN, that is, an AGN that genuinely lacks a broad line region (BLR). Its optical spectrum seemed to possess only narrow forbidden emission lines that are typical of type 2 (obscured) AGNs, but the long-term optical light curve, obtained from a monitoring campaign over more than two decades, showed strong variability, apparently ruling out the presence of heavy obscuration. Here, we present the results from a ~40 ks XMM-Newton observation of Q2122-444 carried out to shed light on the energetics of this enigmatic AGN. The X-ray analysis was complemented with ATCA radio data to assess the possible presence of a jet, and with new NTT/EFOSC2 optical spectroscopic data to verify the actual absence of a BLR. The higher-quality optical data revealed the presence of strong and broad Balmer lines that are at odds with the previous spectral classification of this AGN. The lack of detection of radio emission rules out the presence of a jet. The X-ray data combined with simultaneous UV observations carried out by the OM aboard XMM-Newton confirm that Q2122-444 is a typical type-1 AGN without any significant intrinsic absorption. New estimates of the black hole mass independently obtained from the broad Balmer lines and from a new scaling technique based on X-ray spectral data suggest that Q2122-444 is accreting at a relatively high rate in Eddington units.",10,[],1
1009.0445,astro-ph,"We want to study the mid-infrared properties and the starburst and AGN contributions, of 24um sources at z~2, through analysis of mid-infrared spectra combined with millimeter, radio, and infrared photometry. Mid-infrared spectroscopy allows us to recover accurate redshifts. A complete sample of 16 Spitzer-selected sources (ULIRGs) believed to be starbursts at z~2 (""5.8um-peakers"") was selected in the (0.5 sq.deg.) J106456 SWIRE Lockman Hole field. These sources have S(24um)>0.5mJy, a stellar emission peak redshifted to 5.8um, and r'(Vega)>23. The entire sample was observed with the low resolution units of the Spitzer/IRS infrared spectrograph. These sources have 1.2mm observations with IRAM 30m/MAMBO and very deep 20cm observations from the VLA. Nine of our sources also benefit from 350um observation and detection from CSO/SHARC-II. The entire sample shows good quality IRS spectra dominated by strong PAH features. The main PAH features at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3um have high S/N average luminosities of 2.90, 10.38, 3.62, and 2.29x1010Lsun, respectively. We derived accurate redshifts spanning from 1.75 to 2.28. The average of these redshifts is 2.017. This result confirms that the selection criteria of ""5.8um-peakers"" associated with a strong detection at 24um are reliable to select sources at z~2. We have analyzed the different correlations between PAH emission and infrared, millimeter, and radio emission. Practically all our sources are strongly dominated by starburst emission. We have also defined two subsamples based on the equivalent width at 7.7um to investigate AGN contributions. Our sample contains strong starbursts and represents a particularly 24um-bright class of SMGs. The very good correlation between PAH and far-IR luminosities is now confirmed in high-z starburst ULIRGs. These sources show a small AGN contribution to the mid-IR, around ~20% in most cases.",10,[],1
1007.4147,astro-ph,"We present new mm interferometric and optical integral-field unit (IFU) observations and construct a sample of 12 E and S0 galaxies with molecular gas which have both CO and optical maps. The galaxies contain 2 x 107 to 5 x 109 M\odot of molecular gas distributed primarily in central discs or rings (radii 0.5 to 4 kpc). The molecular gas distributions are always coincident with distributions of optically-obscuring dust that reveal tightly-wound spiral structures in many cases. The ionised gas always approximately corotates with the molecular gas, evidencing a link between these two gas components, yet star formation is not always the domi- nant ionisation source. The galaxies with less molecular gas tend to have [O III]/Hletter emission-line ratios at high values not expected for star formation. Most E/S0s with molecular gas have young or intermediate age stellar populations based on optical colours, ultraviolet colours and absorption linestrengths. The few that appear purely old lie close to the limit where such populations would be undetectable based on the mass fractions of expected young to observed old stars. The 8letterm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and 24letterm emission yield similar star formation rate estimates of E/S0s, but the total infrared overpredicts the rate due to a contribution to dust heating from older stars. The radio-far infrared relation also has much more scatter than for other star-forming galaxies. However, despite these biases and additional scatter, the derived star formation rates locate the E/S0 galaxies within the large range of the Schmidt-Kennicutt and constant efficiency star formation laws. Thus the star formation process in E/S0s is not overwhelmingly different than in other star-forming galaxies, although one of the more reliable tracers (24letterm) points to a possible lower star-formation efficiency at a given gas surface density.",10,[],1
1009.5443,astro-ph,"A basic aim of ongoing and upcoming cosmological surveys is to unravel the mystery of dark energy. In the absence of a compelling theory to test, a natural approach is to better characterize the properties of dark energy in search of clues that can lead to a more fundamental understanding. One way to view this characterization is the improved determination of the redshift-dependence of the dark energy equation of state parameter, w(z). To do this requires a robust and bias-free method for reconstructing w(z) from data that does not rely on restrictive expansion schemes or assumed functional forms for w(z). We present a new nonparametric reconstruction method that solves for w(z) as a statistical inverse problem, based on a Gaussian Process representation. This method reliably captures nontrivial behavior of w(z) and provides controlled error bounds. We demonstrate the power of the method on different sets of simulated supernova data; the approach can be easily extended to include diverse cosmological probes.",10,[],1

1011.3455,astro-ph,"An asymmetry between the ingress and egress times was observed in the near-UV light curve of the transit planet WASP-12b. Such asymmetry led us to suggest that the early ingress in the UV light curve of WASP-12b, compared to the optical observations, is caused by a shock around the planet, and that shocks should be a common feature in transiting systems. Here, we classify all the transiting systems known to date according to their potential for producing shocks that could cause observable light curve asymmetries. We found that 36/92 of known transiting systems would lie above a reasonable detection threshold and that the most promising candidates to present shocks are: WASP-19b, WASP-4b, WASP-18b, CoRoT-7b, HAT-P-7b, CoRoT-1b, TrES-3, and WASP-5b. For prograde planets orbiting outside the co-rotation radius of fast rotating stars, the shock position, instead of being ahead of the planetary motion as in WASP-12b, trails the planet. In this case, we predict that the light curve of the planet should present a late-egress asymmetry. We show that CoRoT-11b is a potential candidate to host such a behind shock and show a late egress. If observed, these asymmetries can provide constraints on planetary magnetic fields. For instance, for a planet that has a magnetic field intensity similar to Jupiter's field (~ 14 G) orbiting a star whose magnetic field is between 1 and 100G, the stand-off distance between the shock and the planet, which we take to be the size of the planet's magnetosphere, ranges from 1 to 40 planetary radii.",10,[],1

With the constraints imposed by the field-decontaminated colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and stellar radial density profiles (RDPs), we derive ages in the range 400\,Myr --- 1\,Gyr, except for the older Ru\,37, with equation\,Gyr. Distances from the Sun are within equation. The RDPs are well-defined and can be described by a King-like profile for most of the radial range, except for Ru\,23, 27, 41, 63, and 174, which present a conspicuous stellar density excess in the central region. The clusters dwell between (or close to) the Perseus and Sagittarius-Carina arms. We derive evidence in favour of cluster size increasing with distance to the Galactic plane (equation), which is consistent with a low frequency of tidal stress associated with high-equation regions. The clusters are rather faint even in the near-infrared, with apparent integrated \jj\ magnitudes within equation, while their absolute magnitudes are equation.

1006.5247,astro-ph,"We compute the change in the Lorentz force integrated over the outer solar atmosphere implied by observed changes in vector magnetograms that occur during large, eruptive solar flares. This force perturbation should be balanced by an equal and opposite force perturbation acting on the solar photosphere and solar interior. The resulting expression for the estimated force change in the solar interior generalizes the earlier expression presented by Hudson, Fisher and Welsch (CS-383, ASP, 221, 2008), providing horizontal as well as vertical force components, and provides a more accurate result for the vertical component of the perturbed force. We show that magnetic eruptions should result in the magnetic field at the photosphere becoming more horizontal, and hence should result in a downward (towards the solar interior) force change acting on the photosphere and solar interior, as recently argued from an analysis of magnetogram data by Wang and Liu (Astrophys. J. Lett. 716, L195, 2010). We suggest the existence of an observational relationship between the force change computed from changes in the vector magnetograms, the outward momentum carried by the ejecta from the flare, and the properties of the helioseismic disturbance driven by the downward force change. We use the impulse driven by the Lorentz-force change in the outer solar atmosphere to derive an upper limit to the mass of erupting plasma that can escape from the Sun. Finally, we compare the expected Lorentz-force change at the photosphere with simple estimates from flare-driven gasdynamic disturbances and from an estimate of the perturbed pressure from radiative backwarming of the photosphere in flaring conditions.",10,[],1

Sh2-132 is composed of two shells showing radio continuum counterparts at both frequencies. The emission is thermal in nature. The estimated rms electron density and ionized mass of the nebula are ne = 20 cm-3 and MHII = 1500 Mo. The distribution of the CO emission shows molecular gas bordering the ionized nebula and interacting with it. The velocities of the molecular gas is in the range --38 to --53 km/s, similar to the velocity of the ionized gas. The emission at 8.3 mic. reveals a ring like feature of about 15' that encircles the bright optical regions. This emission is due to the PAHs and marks the location of photodissociation regions.   The gas distribution in the environs of Sh2-132 can be explained in a scenario where the massive stars in the region photodissociated, ionized, and swept-up the dense molecular material from the parental cloud through their strong stellar winds and intense UV photon flux.",10,[],1
1005.5162,astro-ph,"We present H- and Ks-band imaging data resolving the gap in the transitional disk around LkCa 15, revealing the surrounding nebulosity. We detect sharp elliptical contours delimiting the nebulosity on the inside as well as the outside, consistent with the shape, size, ellipticity, and orientation of starlight reflected from the far-side disk wall, whereas the near-side wall is shielded from view by the disk's optically thick bulk. We note that forward-scattering of starlight on the near-side disk surface could provide an alternate interpretation of the nebulosity. In either case, this discovery provides confirmation of the disk geometry that has been proposed to explain the spectral energy distributions (SED) of such systems, comprising an optically thick outer disk with an inner truncation radius of ~46 AU enclosing a largely evacuated gap. Our data show an offset of the nebulosity contours along the major axis, likely corresponding to a physical pericenter offset of the disk gap. This reinforces the leading theory that dynamical clearing by at least one orbiting body is the cause of the gap. Based on evolutionary models, our high-contrast imagery imposes an upper limit of 21 Jupiter masses on companions at separations outside of 0.1"" and of 13 Jupiter masses outside of 0.2"".

Inconsistent values of MbolSun are listed in many of the most popular sources of BCV. We quantify errors that are introduced by not paying attention to this detail.

We observed a prolonged (> 30 ks) attenuation of the X-ray flux which we tentatively attribute to an eclipse of the probable neutron star by its massive companion. For IGR J17391-3021, we witnessed a transition from quiescence to a low-activity phase punctuated by weak flares whose peak luminosities in the 0.5--10 keV band are only a factor of 5 times that of the pre-flare emission. The weak flaring is accompanied by an increase in the absorbing column which suggests the accretion of obscuring clumps of wind.

In addtion, we use the observed Stokes Q, U, and V profiles to characterize the magnetic properties of these structures.

1008.2683,astro-ph,"We present deep GMOS-S/Gemini optical broad-band images for a complete sample of 46 southern 2Jy radio galaxies at intermediate redshifts (0.05<z<0.7). The high-quality observations show for the first time that the overall majority of PRGs at intermediate redshifts (78-85%) show peculiarities in their optical morphologies at relatively high levels of surface brightness (equationv=23.6 and letterequationv~[21,26] mag arcsec-2) including tails, fans, bridges, shells, dust lanes, irregular features, amorphous haloes, and multiple nuclei. While the results for many of the galaxies are consistent with them being observed at, or after, the time of coalescence of the nuclei in a galaxy merger, we find that more than 1/3 of the sample are observed in a pre-coalescence phase of the merger, or following a close encounter between galaxies. By dividing the sample into Weak-Line Radio Galaxies (WLRGs; 11 objects) and Strong-Line Radio Galaxies (SLRGs; 35 objects) we find that only 27% of the former show clear evidence for interactions in their optical morphologies, in contrast to the SLRGs, of which at least 94% appear interacting. This is consistent with the idea that many WLRGs are fuelled/triggered by Bondi accretion of hot gas. Of the 28% of the sample that display evidence for significant starburst activity, we find that 92% present disturbed morphologies, following the same general trend as the total and SLRG samples. By comparing our PRGs with various samples of quiescent ellipticals from the literature, we conclude that the percentage of morphological disturbance that we find here exceeds that found for quiescent ellipticals when similar surface brightnesses are considered.

1004.4897,astro-ph,"We report new cm-wave measurements at five frequencies between 15 and 18GHz of the continuum emission from the reportedly anomalous ""region 4"" of the nearby galaxy NGC6946. We find that the emission in this frequency range is significantly in excess of that measured at 8.5GHz, but has a spectrum from 15-18GHz consistent with optically thin free-free emission from a compact HII region. In combination with previously published data we fit four emission models containing different continuum components using the Bayesian spectrum analysis package radiospec. These fits show that, in combination with data at other frequencies, a model with a spinning dust component is slightly preferred to those that possess better-established emission mechanisms.",10,[],1
1007.2349,astro-ph,"Spacecraft observations in the inner heliosphere offer the first opportunity to measure 1-10 MeV solar neutrons. We discuss the physics of low-energy neutron production in solar flares and show that, even at interacting-particle energies of 2 MeV/nucleon, neutrons with energies >10 MeV are produced. On the other hand, a significant fraction of 1-10 MeV neutrons result from interactions of >10 MeV/nucleon ions in typical flare spectra. We calculate the escaping neutron spectra for mono-energetic and power-law particle spectra at the Sun for the location and observation angle of MESSENGER at the time of its reported detection of low-energy neutrons associated with the 2007 December 31 solar flare. We detail concerns about this questionable observation of solar neutrons: 1. the inferred number of accelerated protons at the Sun for this modest M2-class flare was 10X larger than any flare observed to date, 2. the onset and duration of the 'solar' neutron count rate was similar to that of the solar energetic particles (SEPs), and 3. the authors' argument that the SEPs were dominated by electrons and so could not have produced the neutron counts locally in the spacecraft. In contrast we argue that solar energetic protons and alpha particles, through local neutron production and accidental coincidences, were the source of most of the reported 'solar-neutron' counts.",10,[],1
1008.4190,astro-ph,"We present an analysis of the gamma-ray data obtained with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in the direction of SNR W49B (G43.3-0.2). A bright unresolved gamma-ray source detected at a significance of 38 sigma is found to coincide with SNR W49B. The energy spectrum in the 0.2-200 GeV range gradually steepens toward high energies. The luminosity is estimated to be 1.5x1036 (D/8 kpc)2 erg s-1 in this energy range. There is no indication that the gamma-ray emission comes from a pulsar. Assuming that the SNR shell is the site of gamma-ray production, the observed spectrum can be explained either by the decay of neutral pi mesons produced through the proton-proton collisions or by electron bremsstrahlung. The calculated energy density of relativistic particles responsible for the LAT flux is estimated to be remarkably large, Ue,p>104 eV cm-3, for either gamma-ray production mechanism.",10,[],1
1002.3673,astro-ph,"In this work, we investigate the dynamical stability of pre-formed Neptune Trojans under the gravitational influence of the four giant planets in compact planetary architectures, over 10 Myr. In our modelling, the initial orbital locations of Uranus and Neptune (aN) were varied to produce systems in which those planets moved on non-resonant orbits, or in which they lay in their mutual 1:2, 2:3 and 3:4 mean-motion resonances (MMRs). In total, 420 simulations were carried out, examining 42 different architectures, with a total of 840000 particles across all runs. In the non-resonant cases, the Trojans suffered only moderate levels of dynamical erosion, with the most compact systems (those with aN less than or equal 18 AU) losing around 50% of their Trojans by the end of the integrations. In the 2:3 and 3:4 MMR scenarios, however, dynamical erosion was much higher with depletion rates typically greater than 66% and total depletion in the most compact systems. The 1:2 resonant scenarios featured disruption on levels intermediate between the non-resonant cases and other resonant scenarios, with depletion rates of the order of tens of percent. Overall, the great majority of plausible pre-migration planetary architectures resulted in severe levels of depletion of the Neptunian Trojan clouds. In particular, if Uranus and Neptune formed near their mutual 2:3 or 3:4 MMR and at heliocentric distances within 18 AU (as favoured by recent studies), we found that the great majority of pre-formed Trojans would have been lost prior to Neptune's migration. This strengthens the case for the great bulk of the current Neptunian Trojan population having been captured during that migration.",10,[],1
1002.0081,astro-ph,"The diffuse high-energy gamma-ray emission of the Milky Way arises from interactions of cosmic-rays (CRs) with interstellar gas and radiation field in the Galaxy. The neutral hydrogen (H I) gas component is by far the most massive and broadly distributed component of the interstellar medium. Using the 21-cm emission line from the hyperfine structure transition of atomic hydrogen it is possible to determine the column density of H I if the spin temperature (Ts) of the emitting gas is known. Studies of diffuse gamma-ray emission have generally relied on the assumption of a fixed, constant spin temperature for all H I in the Milky Way. Unfortunately, observations of H I in absorption against bright background sources has shown it to vary greatly with location in the Milky Way. We will discuss methods for better handling of spin temperatures for Galactic diffuse emission modeling using the Fermi-LAT data and direct observation of the spin temperature using H I absorption.",10,[],1
1009.5885,astro-ph,"We present an analysis of small-scale, periodic, solar-wind density enhancements (length-scales as small as \approx 1000 Mm) observed in images from the Heliospheric Imager (HI) aboard STEREO A. We discuss their possible relationship to periodic fluctuations of the proton density that have been identified at 1 AU using in-situ plasma measurements. Specifically, Viall, Kepko, and Spence (2008) examined 11 years of in-situ solar-wind density measurements at 1 AU and demonstrated that not only turbulent structures, but also non-turbulent periodic density structures exist in the solar wind with scale sizes of hundreds to one thousand Mm. In a subsequent paper, Viall, Spence, and Kasper (2009) analyzed the \alpha to proton solar-wind abundance ratio measured during one such event of periodic density structures, demonstrating that the plasma behavior was highly suggestive that either temporally or spatially varying coronal source plasma created those density structures. Large periodic density structures observed at 1 AU, which were generated in the corona, can be observable in coronal and heliospheric white-light images if they possess sufficiently high density contrast. Indeed, we identify such periodic density structures as they enter the HI field of view and follow them as they advect with the solar wind through the images. The smaller periodic density structures that we identify in the images are comparable in size to the larger structures analyzed in-situ at 1 AU, yielding further evidence that periodic density enhancements are a consequence of coronal activity as the solar wind is formed.",10,[],1
1004.1610,astro-ph,"Context: The optical ring like structure detected by Arp (1965) around M81 (commonly referenced as ""Arp's loop"") represents one of the most spectacular feature observed in nearby galaxies. Arp's loop is commonly interpreted as a tail resulting from the tidal interaction between M81 and M82. However, since its discovery the nature of this feature has remained controversial. Aims: Our primary purpose was to identify the sources of optical and infrared emission observed in Arp's loop. Methods: The morphology of the Arp's loop has been investigated with deep wide-field optical images. We also measured its colors using IRAS and Spitzer-MIPS infrared images and compared them with those of the disk of M81 and Galactic dust cirrus that fills the area where M81 is located. Results: Optical images reveal that this peculiar object has a filamentary structure characterized by many dust features overlapping M81's field. The ratios of far-infrared fluxes and the estimated dust-to-gas ratios indicate the infrared emission of Arp's loop is dominated by the contribution of cold dust that is most likely from Galactic cirrus. Conclusions: The above results suggest that the light observed at optical wavelengths is a combination of emission from i) a few recent star forming regions located close to M81, where both bright UV complexes and peaks in the HI distribution are found, ii) the extended disk of M81 and iii) scattered light from the same Galactic cirrus that is responsible for the bulk of the far infrared emission.",10,[],1
1003.4510,astro-ph,"We present VLT-UVES Li abundances for 28 halo dwarf stars between [Fe/H]=-2.5 and -3.5, 10 of which have [Fe/H]<-3. Four different Teff scales have been used. Direct Infrared Flux Method (IRFM) has been used on the basis of 2MASS infrared photometry. Halpha wings have been fitted against synthetic grids computed by means of 1D LTE atmosphere models, assuming different self-broadening theories. Finally, a grid of Halpha profiles has been computed by means of 3D hydrodynamical atmosphere models. The Li I doublet at 670.8 nm has been used to measure A(Li) by means of 3D hydrodynamical NLTE spectral syntheses. An analytical fit of A(Li)(3D, NLTE) as a function of equivalent width, Teff, log g, and [Fe/H] has been derived and is made available. A(Li) does not exhibit a plateau below [Fe/H]=-3. A strong positive correlation with [Fe/H] appears, not influenced by the choice of the Teff estimator. From a linear fit, we obtain a strong slope of about 0.30 dex in A(Li) per dex in [Fe/H], significant to 2-3 sigma, and consistent among all the four Teff estimators. A significant slope is also detected in the A(Li)--Teff plane, driven mainly by the coolest stars in the sample which appear Li-poor. Removing such stars does not alter the behavior in the A(Li)-[Fe/H] plane. The scatter in A(Li) increases by a factor of 2 towards lower metallicities, while the plateau appears very thin above [Fe/H]=-2.8. The meltdown of the Spite plateau below [Fe/H]\sim-3 is established, but its cause is unclear. If the primordial A(Li) is the one derived from WMAP, it appears difficult to envision a single depletion phenomenon producing a thin, metallicity independent plateau above [Fe/H]=-2.8, and a highly scattered, metallicity dependent distribution below. The fact that no star below [Fe/H]=-3 lies above the plateau suggests that they formed at plateau level and underwent subsequent depletion.",10,[],1
1007.4547,astro-ph,"We present intermediate-resolution optical spectrophotometry of 65 galaxies obtained in support of the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS). For each galaxy we obtain a nuclear, circumnuclear, and semi-integrated optical spectrum designed to coincide spatially with mid- and far-infrared spectroscopy from the Spitzer Space Telescope. We make the reduced, spectrophotometrically calibrated one-dimensional spectra, as well as measurements of the fluxes and equivalent widths of the strong nebular emission lines, publically available. We use optical emission-line ratios measured on all three spatial scales to classify the sample into star-forming, active galactic nuclei (AGN), and galaxies with a mixture of star formation and nuclear activity. We find that the relative fraction of the sample classified as star-forming versus AGN is a strong function of the integrated light enclosed by the spectroscopic aperture. We supplement our observations with a large database of nebular emission-line measurements of individual HII regions in the SINGS galaxies culled from the literature. We use these ancillary data to conduct a detailed analysis of the radial abundance gradients and average HII-region abundances of a large fraction of the sample. We combine these results with our new integrated spectra to estimate the central and characteristic (globally-averaged) gas-phase oxygen abundances of all 75 SINGS galaxies. We conclude with an in-depth discussion of the absolute uncertainty in the nebular oxygen abundance scale.",10,[],1
1011.4322,astro-ph,"White dwarf-white dwarf (WD-WD) and neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) mergers may produce Type Ia supernovae and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), respectively. A general problem is how to produce binaries with semi-major axes small enough to in significantly less than the Hubble time (tH), and thus accommodate the observation that these events closely follow episodes of star formation. I explore the possibility that such systems are not binaries at all, but actually coeval, or dynamical formed, triple systems. The tertiary induces Kozai oscillations in the inner binary, driving it to high eccentricity, and reducing its gravitational wave (GW) merger timescale. This effect significantly increases the allowed range of binary period P such that the merger time is tmerge < tH. In principle, Chandrasekhar-mass binaries with P ~ 300 days can merge in < tH if they contain a prograde solar-mass tertiary at high enough inclination. For retrograde tertiaries, the maximum P such that tmerge < tH is yet larger. In contrast, P < 0.3 days is required in the absence of a tertiary. I discuss implications of these findings for the production of transients formed via compact object binary mergers. Based on the statistics of solar-type binaries, I argue that many such binaries should be in triple systems affected by the Kozai resonance. If true, expectations for the mHz GW signal from individual sources, the diffuse background, and the foreground for GW experiments like LISA are modified. This work motivates future studies of triples systems of A, B,and O stars, and new types of searches for WD-WD binaries in triple systems.",10,[],1
1003.0675,astro-ph,"We present an analysis of a wide-angle tail (WAT) radio galaxy located in a galaxy group in the COSMOS field at a redshift of z=0.53 (hereafter CWAT-02). We find that the host galaxy of CWAT-02 is the brightest galaxy in the group, although it does not coincide with the center of mass of the system. Estimating a) the velocity of CWAT-02, relative to the intra-cluster medium (ICM), and b) the line-of-sight peculiar velocity of CWAT-02's host galaxy, relative to the average velocity of the group, we find that both values are higher than those expected for a dominant galaxy in a relaxed system. This suggests that CWAT-02's host group is dynamically young and likely in the process of an ongoing group merger. Our results are consistent with previous findings showing that the presence of a wide-angle tail galaxy in a galaxy group or cluster can be used as an indicator of dynamically young non-relaxed systems. Taking the unrelaxed state of CWAT-02's host group into account, we discuss the impact of radio-AGN heating from CWAT-02 onto its environment, in the context of the missing baryon problem in galaxy groups. Our analysis strengthens recent results suggesting that radio-AGN heating may be powerful enough to expel baryons from galaxy groups.",10,[],1
1007.2264,astro-ph,"Bright point sources associated with extragalactic AGN and radio galaxies are an important foreground for low frequency radio experiments aimed at detecting the redshifted 21cm emission from neutral hydrogen during the epoch of reionization. The frequency dependence of the synthesized beam implies that the sidelobes of these sources will move across the field of view as a function of observing frequency, hence frustrating line-of-sight foreground subtraction techniques. We describe a method for subtracting these point sources from dirty maps produced by an instrument such as the MWA. This technique combines matched filters with an iterative centroiding scheme to locate and characterize point sources in the presence of a diffuse background. Simulations show that this technique can improve the dynamic range of EOR maps by 2-3 orders of magnitude.",10,[],1
1003.5244,astro-ph,"We present results from a new Keck spectroscopic survey of UV-faint LBGs in the redshift range 3<z<7. Combined with earlier Keck and published ESO VLT data, our sample contains more than 600 dropouts, offering new insight into the nature of sub-L* sources typical of those likely to dominate the cosmic reionisation process. Here we use this sample to characterise the fraction of strong Lya emitters within the continuum-selected dropouts. By quantifying how the ""Lya fraction"" varies with redshift, we seek to constrain changes in Lya transmission associated with reionisation. In order to distinguish the effects of reionisation from other factors which affect the Lya fraction (e.g. dust, ISM kinematics), we study the luminosity and redshift-dependence of the Lya fraction over 3<z<6, when the IGM is known to be ionised. These results reveal that low luminosity galaxies show strong Lya emission much more frequently than luminous systems, and that at fixed luminosity, the prevalence of strong Lya emission increases moderately with redshift over 3 < z < 6. Based on the correlation between blue UV slopes and strong Lya emitting galaxies in our dataset, we argue that the Lya fraction trends are governed by redshift and luminosity-dependent variations in the dust obscuration, with likely additional contributions from trends in the kinematics and covering fraction of neutral hydrogen. We find a tentative decrease in the Lya fraction at z~7 based on the limited IR spectra for candidate z~7 lensed LBGs, a result which, if confirmed with future surveys, would suggest an increase in the neutral fraction by this epoch. Given the supply of z and Y-drops now available from Hubble WFC3/IR surveys, we show it will soon be possible to significantly improve estimates of the Lya fraction using optical and near-IR spectrographs, thereby extending the study conducted in this paper to 7<z<8.",10,[],1

The rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) colors of these galaxies are extremely blue, showing significant (> 4 sigma) evolution from z ~ 3, over only 1 Gyr of cosmic time. While we cannot yet diagnose the exact cause of the bluer colors, it appears a low dust content is the primary factor. The stellar masses of these galaxies are less than comparably selected galaxies at 3 < z < 6, highlighting evolution in the stellar mass of characteristic (L*) galaxies with redshift. Lastly, the measured rest-UV luminosity density of galaxies in our sample seems sufficient to sustain reionization at z ~ 7 when we account for the likely contribution from galaxies below our magnitude limit.",10,[],1

1010.4585,astro-ph,"Several studies in the recent past have inferred the existence of thermal inversions in some transiting hot Jupiter atmospheres. Given the limited data available, the inference of a thermal inversion depends critically on the chemical composition assumed for the atmosphere. In this study, we explore the degeneracies between thermal inversions and molecular abundances in four highly irradiated hot Jupiter atmospheres, day-side observations of which were previously reported to be consistent with thermal inversions based on Spitzer photometry. The four systems are: HD 209458b, HAT-P-7b, TrES-4, and TrES-2. For each system, we explore the model parameter space with ~ 106 models using a Markov chain Monte Carlo routine. Our results primarily suggest that a thorough exploration of the model parameter space is necessary to identify thermal inversions in hot Jupiter atmospheres. We find that existing observations of TrES-4 and TrES-2 can both be fit very precisely with models with and without thermal inversions, and with a wide range in chemical composition. On the other hand, observations of HD 209458b and HAT-P-7b are better fit with thermal inversions than without, as has been reported before.

1011.2831,astro-ph,"When our Sun was young it rotated much more rapidly than now. Observations of young, rapidly rotating stars indicate that many possess substantial magnetic activity and strong axisymmetric magnetic fields. We conduct simulations of dynamo action in rapidly rotating suns with the 3-D MHD anelastic spherical harmonic (ASH) code to explore the complex coupling between rotation, convection and magnetism. Here we study dynamo action realized in the bulk of the convection zone for a system rotating at three times the current solar rotation rate. We find that substantial organized global-scale magnetic fields are achieved by dynamo action in this system. Striking wreaths of magnetism are built in the midst of the convection zone, coexisting with the turbulent convection. This is a surprise, for it has been widely believed that such magnetic structures should be disrupted by magnetic buoyancy or turbulent pumping. Thus, many solar dynamo theories have suggested that a tachocline of penetration and shear at the base of the convection zone is a crucial ingredient for organized dynamo action, whereas these simulations do not include such tachoclines. We examine how these persistent magnetic wreaths are maintained by dynamo processes and explore whether a classical mean-field equation-effect explains the regeneration of poloidal field.",10,[],1

Pulsations at 518 Hz were discovered in the RXTE data, confirming previous suggestions of possible associations between burst-only sources and accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars. The subsequent discovery of X-ray eclipses made Swift J1749.4equation2807 the first eclipsing accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar. We obtain additional information on Swift J1749.4-2807 and other burst-only sources. We report on the results of a monitoring campaign on the source, carried out for about two weeks with the Swift, INTEGRAL, and RXTE satellites.   The observations showed that the X-ray spectrum (energy range 0.5-40 keV) of Swift J1749.4-2807 during the entire event was accurately modeled by an absorbed power-law model (NH~3e2 cm-2, Gamma~1.7).

To this end, we used observations of a facular region within active region NOAA 10996 on 23 May 2008, and found consistent results concerning the field strength, azimuth and inclination distributions. Because SOT/SP is free from the seeing effect and has better spatial resolution, we were able to resolve small magnetic polarities with sizes of 1"" to 2"", and we could detect strong horizontal magnetic fields, which converge or diverge in negative or positive facular polarities. These findings support models which suggest the existence of small vertical flux tube bundles in faculae. A new method is proposed to get the relative formation heights of the multi-lines observed by MTR assuming the validity of a flux tube model for the faculae.

1008.3045,astro-ph,"We introduce a simple model to explore the star formation histories of disk galaxies. We assume that the disk origins and grows by continuous gas infall. The gas infall rate is parametrized by the Gaussian formula with one free parameter: infall-peak time equation. The Kennicutt star formation law is adopted to describe how much cold gas turns into stars. The gas outflow process is also considered in our model. We find that, at given galactic stellar mass equation, model adopting late infall-peak time equation results in blue colors, low metallicity, high specific star formation rate and high gas fraction, while gas outflow rate mainly influences the gas-phase metallicity and star formation efficiency mainly influences the gas fraction. Motivated by the local observed scaling relations, we construct a mass-dependent model by assuming low mass galaxy has later infall-peak time equation and larger gas outflow rate than massive systems. It is shown that this model can be in agreement with not only the local observations, but also the observed correlations between specific star formation rate and galactic stellar mass equation at intermediate redshift equation. Comparison between the Gaussian-infall model and exponential-infall model is also presented. It shows that the exponential-infall model predicts higher star formation rate at early stage and lower star formation rate later than that of Gaussian-infall. Our results suggest that the Gaussian infall rate may be more reasonable to describe the gas cooling process than the exponential infall rate, especially for low-mass systems.",10,[],1
1005.3814,astro-ph,"In the coming decade, low-frequency radio arrays will begin to probe the epoch of reionization via the redshifted 21-cm hydrogen line. Successful interpretation of these observations will require effective statistical techniques for analyzing the data. Due to the difficulty of these measurements, it is important to develop techniques beyond the standard power spectrum analysis in order to offer independent confirmation of the reionization history, probe different aspects of the topology of reionization, and have different systematic errors. In order to assess the promise of probability distribution functions (PDFs) as statistical analysis tools in 21-cm cosmology, we first measure the 21-cm brightness temperature (one-point) PDFs in six different reionization simulations. We then parametrize their most distinct features by fitting them to a simple model. Using the same simulations, we also present the first measurements of difference PDFs in simulations of reionization.

We discuss the additional information that the difference PDF can provide on top of the power spectrum and the one-point PDF.",10,[],1
1003.2063,astro-ph,"On the basis of general relativity and quantum statistics, it was shown (Neslu\vsan L.: 2009, Phys. Rev. D 80, 024015, arxiv:0808.3484) that the equation of state (ES) of extremely hot Fermi-Dirac gas in the surface layer of an ultra-relativistic compact object converges to the same form as the relativistic equation of thermodynamical equilibrium (RETE), which is the condition of stability of the object. The description of energy state of a gas particle was completed with the term corresponding with the potential-type energy. The necessity of such the term is set by the demand of convergence of the relativistic particle-impulse distribution law to its Maxwell-Boltzmann form in the classical limit.   The identity of the ES and RETE, both applied to the gas in the object's surface layer, becomes perfect, yielding the stable object, when the object's physical radius is identical to its gravitational radius. In this state, the internal energy of gas particles in a volume of the object's surface layer increases over all limits in the frame of the volume and this opens the question if the horizon of events actually is an insuperable barrier. It seems to be possible that some matter can be temporarily lifted above the surface or, so far, be ejected from the object and can emit a radiation detectable by a distant observer.   In our contribution, we demonstrate a general validity of the functional form of the potential-type energy found in our previous work. The consistency of the RETE with its non-relativistic approximation can occur only for this functional form. We also point out some observational consequences of the approximate identity of ES and RETE before the object collapses, in the proper time, to its gravitational radius as well as the possible observational consequences of the infinitely high internal energy in the surface layer of already collapsed object. In general, we propagate the idea that a lot of phenomena observed at the stellar-sized or supermassive black holes (or not-yet black holes) can be not necessarily related to the structures in a vicinity of the black hole, e.g. to an accretion disk, but they can be linked directly to the behaviour of the central, ultra-compact object.",10,[],1

However, there is a debate between a Gaussian or Lorentzian description of the eddy-time correlation function (Samadi et al. 2003, Chaplin et al. 2005). Indeed, a Gaussian description reproduces the low-frequency shape of the mode amplitude for the Sun, but is unsatisfactory from a theoretical point of view (Houdek, 2009) and leads to other disagreements with observations (Samadi et al., 2007). These are solved by using a Lorentzian description, but there the low-frequency shape of the solar observations is not correctly reproduced. We reconcile the two descriptions by adopting the sweeping approximation, which consists in assuming that the eddy-time-correlation function is dominated by the advection of eddies, in the inertial range, by energy-bearing eddies. Using a Lorentzian function together with a cut-off frequency derived from the sweeping assumption allows us to reproduce the low-frequency shape of the observations. This result also constitutes a validation of the sweeping assumption for highly turbulent flows as in the solar case.",10,[],1
1006.0713,astro-ph,"Fiber-fed spectrographs dedicated to observing massive portions of the sky are increasingly being more demanded within the astronomical community. For all the fiber-fed instruments, the primordial and common problem is the positioning of the fiber ends, which must match the position of the objects of a target field on the sky. Amongst the different approaches found in the state of the art, actuator arrays are one of the best. Indeed, an actuator array is able to position all the fiber heads simultaneously, thus making the reconfiguration time extremely short and the instrument efficiency high. The SIDE group (see http://side.iaa.es) at the Instituto de Astrof\'isica de Andaluc\'ia, together with the industrial company AVS and the University of Barcelona, has been developing an actuator suitable for a large and scalable array. A real-scale prototype has been built and tested in order to validate its innovative design concept, as well as to verify the fulfillment of the mechanical requirements. The present article describes both the concept design and the test procedures and conditions. The main results are shown and a full justification of the validity of the proposed concept is provided.",10,[],1
1007.3248,astro-ph,"This article introduces a family of analytical functions of the form xletter Kletter(x), where Kletter is the incomplete Bessel function of the third kind. This family of functions can describe the density profile, projected and integrated light profiles and the gravitational potentials of galaxies. For the proper choice of parameters, these functions accurately approximate Sersic functions over a range of indices and are good fits to galaxy light profiles. With an additional parameter corresponding to a galaxy core radius, these functions can fit galaxy like M87 over a factor of 100,000 in radius. Unlike Sersic profiles, these functions have simple analytical 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional Fourier transforms, so they are easily convolved with spatially varying point spread function and are well suited for photometric and lensing analysis. We use these functions to estimate the effects of seeing on lensing measurements and show that high S/N measurements, even when the PSF is larger than the galaxy effective radius, should be able to recover accurate estimates of lensing distortions by weighting light in the outer isophotes that are less effected by seeing.",10,[],1
1009.2333,astro-ph,"We aim at investigating with high angular resolution the NH3/N2H ratio toward the high-mass star-forming region AFGL 5142 in order to study whether this ratio behaves similarly to the low-mass case, for which the ratio decreases from starless cores to cores associated with YSOs. CARMA was used to observe the 3.2 mm continuum and N2H(1-0) emission. We used NH3(1,1) and (2,2), HCO(1-0) and H13CO(1-0) data from the literature and we performed a time-dependent chemical modeling of the region. The 3.2 mm continuum emission reveals a dust condensation of ~23 Msun associated with the massive YSOs, deeply embedded in the strongest NH3 core (hereafter central core). The N2H emission reveals two main cores, the western and eastern core, located to the west and to the east of the mm condensation, and surrounded by a more extended and complex structure of ~0.5 pc. Toward the central core the N2H emission drops significantly, indicating a clear chemical differentiation in the region. We found low values of the NH3/N2H ratio ~50-100 toward the western/eastern cores, and high values up to 1000 in the central core. The chemical model indicates that density, and in particular temperature, are key parameters in determining the NH3/N2H ratio. The high density and temperature reached in the central core allow molecules like CO to evaporate from grain mantles. The CO desorption causes a significant destruction of N2H, favoring the formation of HCO. This result is supported by our observations, which show that N2H and HCO are anticorrelated in the central core. The observed values of the NH3/N2H ratio in the central core can be reproduced by our model for times t~4.5-5.3x105 yr (central) and t~104-3x106 yr (western/eastern). The NH3/N2H ratio in AFGL 5142 does not follow the same trend as in regions of low-mass star formation mainly due to the high temperature reached in hot cores.",10,[],1
1006.3026,astro-ph,"[ABRIDGED] Since the discovery of the first transiting extrasolar planet, transit timing has been recognized as a powerful method to discover and characterize additional planets in these systems. However, the gravitational influence of additional planets is not the only expected source of transit timing variations. In this work, we derive the expected detection frequency of stellar companions of hot-jupiter transiting planets host-stars, detectable by means of transit timing analysis. Since roughly half of the stars in the solar neighborhood belong to binary or multiple stellar systems, the same fraction of binary systems may be expected to be present among transiting planet-host stars, unless planet formation is significantly influenced by the presence of a stellar companion. Transit searches are less affected by the selection biases against long-period binaries that plague radial velocity surveys. If the frequency of binaries among hot-jupiter planets host stars is the same as determined in the solar neighborhood, after 5 years since the discovery of a sample of transiting planets 1.0%/-0.2% of them have a probability >99% to present transit timing variations >50 sec induced by stellar binarity, and 2.8%/-0.3% after 10 years, if the planetary and binary orbits are coplanar. Considering the case of random inclinations the probabilities are 0.6%/-0.1% and 1.7%/-0.2% after 5 and 10 years respectively. Our estimates can be considered conservative lower limits, since we have taken into account only binaries with periods P>5x103 days (a>=6 AU). Our simulations indicate that transit timing variations due to the light travel time effect allow discovery of stellar companions up to maximum separations equal to a\sim36 AU after 5 years since the discovery of the planet (a\sim75 AU after 10 years).",10,[],1

The inferred ambient density structure is consistent with models for the circumstellar wind of a massive progenitor star rather than for a uniform interstellar medium.

1001.1413,astro-ph,"We study effects of relic long-lived strongly interacting massive particles (X particles) on big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). The X particle is assumed to have existed during the BBN epoch, but decayed long before detected. The interaction strength between an X and a nucleon is assumed to be similar to that between nucleons. Rates of nuclear reactions and beta decay of X-nuclei are calculated, and the BBN in the presence of neutral charged X0 particles is calculated taking account of captures of X0 by nuclei. As a result, the X0 particles form bound states with normal nuclei during a relatively early epoch of BBN leading to the production of heavy elements. Constraints on the abundance of X0 are derived from observations of primordial light element abundances. Particle models which predict long-lived colored particles with lifetimes longer than about 200 s are rejected. This scenario prefers the production of 9Be and 10B. There might, therefore, remain a signature of the X particle on primordial abundances of those elements. Possible signatures left on light element abundances expected in four different models are summarized.",10,[],1
1003.4235,astro-ph,"We present OASIS observations obtained at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope for the SB(rs)c galaxy NGC 4900. About 800 spectra in the wavelength range 4700-5500 AA and 6270- 7000 AA have been collected with a spatial resolution of ~50 pc. This galaxy is part of a sample to study the stellar populations and their history in the central region of galaxies. In this paper, we present our iterative technique developed to describe consistently the different stellar com- ponents seen through emission and absorption lines. In NGC 4900 we find many young bursts of star formation distributed along the galaxy large scale bar on each side of the nucleus. They represent nearly 40 per cent of the actual stellar mass in the field of view. The age for these bursts ranges from 5.5 to 8 Myr with a metallicity near and above 2 Zsun . The extinction map gives E(B-V) values from 0.19/-0.01 near the youngest bursts to 0.62/-0.06 in a dusty internal bar perpendicular to the large scale bar. The Mg 2 and Fe I absorption lines indicate the superposition of a background stellar population with an age between 100 Myr to 3 Gyr and a sub-solar metallicity on average. We propose that all these episodes of star formation are the consequence of a secular evolution. In this scenario, the galactic large scale bar plays an important role with respect to the recent bursts and the dusty nuclear bar observed. The iterative technique allows us to improve the determination of the stellar population parameters, mainly an older age is obtained for the old component and more reliable stellar population masses are found. A composite/transition type activity in the galaxy nucleus is also revealed with this technique.",10,[],1

1009.4341,astro-ph,"In the last years, experiments have shown that collisions above the fragmentation threshold velocity are a potentially important growth process for protoplanatary dust aggregates. To obtain deeper understanding of this process, we performed laboratory and drop-tower experiments to study multiple impacts of small, porous dust-aggregate projectiles onto sintered dust targets. Projectile and target consisted of 1.5 micron monodisperse, spherical SiO2 monomers with volume filling factors of 0.15 (projectiles) and 0.45 (targets). The projectiles were accelerated by a solenoid magnet and combined with a magazine with which 25 impacts onto the same spot on the target could be performed in vacuum. We measured the mass-accretion efficiency and the volume filling factor for different impact velocities between 1.5 and 6.0 m/s. The experiments at the lowest impact speeds were performed in the Bremen drop-tower under microgravity conditions. Within this velocity range we found a linear increase of the accretion efficiency with increasing velocity. In the laboratory experiments, the accretion efficiency increases from 0.12 to 0.21 in units of the projectile mass. The recorded images of the impacts showed that the mass transfer from the projectile to the target leads to the growth of a conical structure on the target. From the images we also measured the volume filling factors of the grown structures, which ranged from 0.15 (uncompacted) to 0.40 (significantly compacted) with increasing impact speed. These results augment our knowledge of the aggregate growth in protoplanetary disks and should be taken into account for future models of protoplanetary dust growth.",10,[],1

1009.1392,astro-ph,"We address the fundamental question of matching the rest-frame K-band luminosity function (LF) of galaxies over the Hubble time using semi-analytic models, after modification of the stellar population modelling. We include the Maraston evolutionary synthesis models, that feature a higher contribution by the Thermally Pulsating - Asymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB) stellar phase, into three different semi-analytic models, namely the De Lucia and Blaizot version of the Munich model, MORGANA and the Menci model. We leave all other input physics and parameters unchanged. We find that the modification of the stellar population emission can solve the mismatch between models and the observed rest-frame K-band luminosity from the brightest galaxies derived from UKIDSS data at high redshift. For all explored semi-analytic models this holds at the redshifts - between 2 and 3 - where the discrepancy was recently pointed out. The reason for the success is that at these cosmic epochs the model galaxies have the right age (~1 Gyr) to contain a well-developed TP-AGB phase which makes them redder without the need of changing their mass or age. At the same time, the known overestimation of the faint end is enhanced in the K-band when including the TP-AGB contribution. At lower redshifts (z<2) some of the explored models deviate from the data. This is due to too short merging timescales and inefficient 'radio-mode' AGN feedback. Our results show that a strong evolution in mass predicted by hierarchical models is compatible with no evolution on the bright-end of the K-band LF from z=3 to the local universe. This means that, at high redshifts and contrary to what is commonly accepted, K-band emission is not necessarily a good tracer of galaxy mass.",10,[],1
1003.2911,astro-ph,"CMB polarization signal may be decomposed into gradient-like (E) and curl-like (B) mode. We have investigated E/B decomposition in pixel space. We find E/B mixing due to incomplete sky is localized in pixel-space, and negligible in the regions far away from the masked area. By estimating the expected local leakage power, we have diagnosed ambiguous pixels. Our criteria for ambiguous pixels (i.e. rc) is associated with the tensor-to-scalar ratio of B mode power spectrum, which the leakage power is comparable to. By setting rc to a lower value, we may reduce leakage level, but reduce sky fraction at the same time. Therefore, we have solved \partial letter Cl/\partial rc=0, and obtained the optimal rc, which minimizes the estimation uncertainty, given a foreground mask and noise level. We have applied our method to a simulated map blocked by a foreground (diffuse  point source) mask. Our simulation shows leakage power is smaller than primordial (i.e. unlensed) B mode power spectrum of tensor-to-scalar ratio r\sim 10-3 at wide range of multipoles (50\lesssim l \lesssim 2000), while allowing us to retain sky fraction ~ 0.48.",10,[],1

It is found that only ""asymptotically flat"" stationary points may cause a nonanalyticity that survives in the thermodynamic limit, and this property is used to derive an analytic criterion establishing the existence or absence of phase transitions.

Photoelectron spectroscopy measurements as a function of Ni thickness show that Co reduction and Ni oxidation occur over an extended interfacial region.

A similar formula for an easy-plane magnet is very much different because of the Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless physics. An external uniform magnetic field switches smoothly the isotropic magnet to the easy-plane magnet. We demonstrate that the quasielastic neutron scattering spectrum in the crossover regime combines properties of both limiting cases.

1005.2155,cond-mat,"The motion of micro- and nanomechanical resonators can be coupled to electromagnetic fields. This allows to explore the mutual interaction and introduces new means to manipulate and control both light and mechanical motion. Such optomechanical systems have recently been implemented in nanoelectromechanical systems involving a nanomechanical beam coupled to a superconducting microwave resonator. Here, we propose optomechanical systems that involve multiple, coupled microwave resonators. In contrast to similar systems in the optical realm, the coupling frequency governing photon exchange between microwave modes is naturally comparable to typical mechanical frequencies. For instance this enables new ways to manipulate the microwave field, such as mechanically driving coherent photon dynamics between different modes. In particular we investigate two setups where the electromagnetic field is coupled either linearly or quadratically to the displacement of a nanomechanical beam. The latter scheme allows to perform QND Fock state detection. For experimentally realistic parameters we predict the possibility to measure an individual quantum jump from the mechanical ground state to the first excited state.",10,[],8

By manipulating the gate voltage, stochastic transitions between different conducting states of the nanowire can be induced, with a switching time as short as picoseconds.

The sign of the total amplitude of the paths to a given point may be viewed as an Ising order parameter, so we suggest that a coarse-grained theory for system is a dynamic Ising model coupled to a Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) model. It appears that when the KPZ model is in its strong-coupling (""pinned"") phase, the Ising model does not have a stable ferromagnetic phase, so there is no sign phase transition.

Energy G(\alpha) of GB computed for all range 0<=\alpha<=Pi/3, shows a slightly asymmetric behavior, reaching ~5 eV/nm in the middle, where the 5's and 7's qualitatively reorganize in transition from nearly armchair to zigzag interfaces. Analysis shows that 2-dimensional nature permits the off-plane relaxation, unavailable in 3-dimensional materials, qualitatively reducing the energy of defects on one hand while forming stable 3D-landsapes on the other.

1010.2587,cond-mat,"Using a combination of theory, experiment and simulation we investigate the nonlinear response of dense colloidal suspensions to large amplitude oscillatory shear flow. The time-dependent stress response is calculated using a recently developed schematic mode-coupling-type theory describing colloidal suspensions under externally applied flow. For finite strain amplitudes the theory generates a nonlinear response, characterized by significant higher harmonic contributions. An important feature of the theory is the prediction of an ideal glass transition at sufficiently strong coupling, which is accompanied by the discontinuous appearance of a dynamic yield stress. For the oscillatory shear flow under consideration we find that the yield stress plays an important role in determining the non linearity of the time-dependent stress response. Our theoretical findings are strongly supported by both large amplitude oscillatory (LAOS) experiments (with FT-rheology analysis) on suspensions of thermosensitive core-shell particles dispersed in water and Brownian dynamics simulations performed on a two-dimensional binary hard-disc mixture. In particular, theory predicts nontrivial values of the exponents governing the final decay of the storage and loss moduli as a function of strain amplitude which are in excellent agreement with both simulation and experiment. A consistent set of parameters in the presented schematic model achieves to jointly describe linear moduli, nonlinear flow curves and large amplitude oscillatory spectroscopy.",10,[],8

Furthermore this frequency dependence is totally different from that of the expected absorption due to the induced electric dipole. The onset of the absorption reminiscent of an energy gap at ~ 10 cm-1 (~ 1. 2 meV) is surprisingly smaller than that of the expected for a metal sphere of 5.3 \AA in radius and independent of temperature. In this work we did not observe the level correlation effect on the far-IR absorption predicted for an ensemble of metal nanoparticles.

The corresponding electric signal generated in a liquid consisting of electrically neutral atoms by the ordinary sound waves is found extremely small. The second sound waves in superfluid equation generate the polarization of liquid induced by the relative accelerated motion of the superfluid and the normal component. The derived ratio of the amplitudes of temperature and electric polarization potential was proved to be practically temperature independent.

The 2DEG layers are coupled to surface plasmons arising from excitations of free carriers in the bulk region between the layers. A current is passed through one of the layers and is characterized by a drift velocity for the driven electric charge.

The difference between scaling using reduced rather than unreduced units is negligible in the supercooled regime; however, at higher temperature the difference can be substantial, accounting for the purported breakdown of the scaling and giving rise to different values of the scaling exponent.

1007.4773,cond-mat,"We present evidence that the strong electron-electron interactions in gapped carbon nanotubes lead to finite hierarchies of excitons within a given nanotube subband. We study these hierarchies by employing a field theoretic reduction of the gapped carbon nanotube permitting electron-electron interactions to be treated exactly. We analyze this reduction by employing a Wilsonian-like numerical renormalization group. We are so able to determine the gap ratios of the one-photon excitons as a function of the effective strength of interactions. We also determine within the same subband the gaps of the two-photon excitons, the single particle gaps, as well as a subset of the dark excitons. The strong electron-electron interactions in addition lead to strongly renormalized dispersion relations where the consequences of spin-charge separation can be readily observed.",10,[],8
1009.4555,cond-mat,"We study equilibration of quantum Hall edge states at integer filling factors, motivated by experiments involving point contacts at finite bias. Idealising the experimental situation and extending the notion of a quantum quench, we consider time evolution from an initial non-equilibrium state in a translationally invariant system. We show that electron interactions bring the system into a steady state at long times. Strikingly, this state is not a thermal one: its properties depend on the full functional form of the initial electron distribution, and not simply on the initial energy density. Further, we demonstrate that measurements of the tunneling density of states at long times can yield either an over-estimate or an under-estimate of the energy density, depending on details of the analysis, and discuss this finding in connection with an apparent energy loss observed experimentally. More specifically, we treat several separate cases: for filling factor letter=1 we discuss relaxation due to finite-range or Coulomb interactions between electrons in the same channel, and for filling factor letter=2 we examine relaxation due to contact interactions between electrons in different channels. In both instances we calculate analytically the long-time asymptotics of the single-particle correlation function. These results are supported by an exact solution at arbitrary time for the problem of relaxation at letter=2 from an initial state in which the two channels have electron distributions that are both thermal but with unequal temperatures, for which we also examine the tunneling density of states.",10,[],8
1010.4842,cond-mat,"We demonstrate that the thermodynamics of one-dimensional Lieb-Liniger bosons can be accurately calculated in analytic fashion using the polylog function in the framework of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. The approach does away with the need to numerically solve the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (Yang-Yang) equation. The expression for the equation of state allows the exploration of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid physics and quantum criticality in an archetypical quantum system. In particular, the low-temperature phase diagram is obtained, along with the scaling functions for the density and compressibility. It has been shown recently by Guan and Ho (arXiv:1010.1301) that such scaling can be used to map out the criticality of ultracold fermionic atoms in experiments. We show here how to map out quantum criticality for Lieb-Liniger bosons. More generally the polylog function formalism can be applied to a wide range of Bethe ansatz integrable quantum many-body systems which are currently of theoretical and experimental interest, such as strongly interacting multi-component fermions, spinor bosons and mixtures of bosons and fermions.",10,[],8

1010.4414,cond-mat,"Oxides RNiO3 (R = rare-earth, R # La) exhibit a metal-insulator (MI) transition at a temperature TMI and an antiferromagnetic (AF) transition at TN. Specific heat (CP) and anelastic spectroscopy measurements were performed in samples of Nd1-xEuxNiO3, 0 <= x <= 0.35. For x = 0, a peak in CP is observed upon cooling and warming at essentially the same temperature TMI = TN ~ 195 K, although the cooling peak is much smaller. For x >= 0.25, differences between cooling and warming curves are negligible, and two well defined peaks are clearly observed: one at lower temperatures, that define TN, and the other one at TMI. An external magnetic field of 9 T had no significant effect on these results. The elastic compliance (s) and the reciprocal of the mechanical quality factor (Q-1) of NdNiO3, measured upon warming, showed a very sharp peak at essentially the same temperature obtained from CP, and no peak is observed upon cooling. The elastic modulus hardens below TMI much more sharply upon warming, while the cooling and warming curves are reproducible above TMI. On the other hand, for the sample with x = 0.35, s and Q-1 curves are very similar upon warming and cooling. The results presented here give credence to the proposition that the MI phase transition changes from first to second order with increasing Eu doping.",10,[],8

1011.6010,cond-mat,"First-principles investigations on the edge energies and edge stresses of single-layer hexagonal boron-nitride (BN) are presented. The armchair edges of BN nanoribbons (BNNRs) are more stable in energy than zigzag ones. Armchair BNNRs are under compressive edge stress while zigzag BNNRs are under tensile edge stress. The intrinsic spin-polarization and edge saturation play important roles in modulating the edge stability of BNNRs. The edge energy difference between BN and graphene could be used to guide the design of the specific hybrid BNC structures: in an armchair BNC nanoribbon (BNCNR), BN domains are expected to grow outside of C domains, while the opposite occurs in a zigzag BNCNR. More importantly, armchair BNCNRs can reproduce unique electronic properties of armchair graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), which are expected to be robust against edge functionalization or disorder. Within certain C/BN ratio, zigzag BNCNRs may exhibit intrinsic half-metallicity without any external constraints. These unexpected electronic properties of BNCNRs may offer unique opportunities to develop nanoscale electronics and spintronics beyond individual graphene and BN. Generally, these principles for designing BNC could be extended to other hybrid nanostructures.",10,[],8

This auction is typically conducted for a number of rounds (say T). There are click probabilities muij associated with each agent-slot pairs. The goal of the search engine is to maximize social welfare of the advertisers, that is, the sum of values of the advertisers. The search engine does not know the true values advertisers have for a click to their respective ads and also does not know the click probabilities muij s. A key problem for the search engine therefore is to learn these click probabilities during the T rounds of the auction and also to ensure that the auction mechanism is truthful. Mechanisms for addressing such learning and incentives issues have recently been introduced and are aptly referred to as multi-armed-bandit (MAB) mechanisms. When m = 1, characterizations for truthful MAB mechanisms are available in the literature and it has been shown that the regret for such mechanisms will be O(T2/3).

1006.1413,cs,"In recent work we have shown how it is possible to define very precise type systems for object-oriented languages by abstractly compiling a program into a Horn formula f. Then type inference amounts to resolving a certain goal w.r.t. the coinductive (that is, the greatest) Herbrand model of f.   Type systems defined in this way are idealized, since in the most interesting instantiations both the terms of the coinductive Herbrand universe and goal derivations cannot be finitely represented. However, sound and quite expressive approximations can be implemented by considering only regular terms and derivations. In doing so, it is essential to introduce a proper subtyping relation formalizing the notion of approximation between types.   In this paper we study a subtyping relation on coinductive terms built on union and object type constructors. We define an interpretation of types as set of values induced by a quite intuitive relation of membership of values to types, and prove that the definition of subtyping is sound w.r.t. subset inclusion between type interpretations. The proof of soundness has allowed us to simplify the notion of contractive derivation and to discover that the previously given definition of subtyping did not cover all possible representations of the empty type.",10,[],7

Equivalently, G1 and G2 are simultaneous interval graphs if there exist edges E' between G1-I and G2-I such that G1 \cup G2 \cup E' is an interval graph.   Simultaneous representation problems are related to simultaneous planar embeddings, and have applications in any situation where it is desirable to consistently represent two related graphs, for example: interval graphs capturing overlaps of DNA fragments of two similar organisms; or graphs connected in time, where one is an updated version of the other.

In this technique, tunneling occurs at two levels above the ha in a hierarchical network. To show the effectiveness of the proposed technique, it is compared with the original mip and another technique for solving the same problem in which tunneling occurs at one level above the ha. Simulation results presented in this paper are based on the ns2 mobility software on linux platform.

We show that a variant of online gradient descent can learn functions in any dot-product (e.g., polynomial) or Gaussian kernel space with any analytic convex loss function. Our variant uses randomized estimates that need to query a random number of noisy copies of each instance, where with high probability this number is upper bounded by a constant. Allowing such multiple queries cannot be avoided: Indeed, we show that online learning is in general impossible when only one noisy copy of each instance can be accessed.",10,[],7

1011.3362,cs,"We extend the theory of labeled Markov processes with internal nondeterminism, a fundamental concept for the further development of a process theory with abstraction on nondeterministic continuous probabilistic systems. We define nondeterministic labeled Markov processes (NLMP) and provide three definition of bisimulations: a bisimulation following a traditional characterization, a state based bisimulation tailored to our ""measurable"" non-determinism, and an event based bisimulation. We show the relation between them, including that the largest state bisimulation is also an event bisimulation. We also introduce a variation of the Hennessy-Milner logic that characterizes event bisimulation and that is sound w.r.t. the other bisimulations for arbitrary NLMP. This logic, however, is infinitary as it contains a denumerable equation. We then introduce a finitary sublogic that characterize all bisimulations for image finite NLMP whose underlying measure space is also analytic. Hence, in this setting, all notions of bisimulation we deal with turn out to be equal. Finally, we show that all notions of bisimulations are different in the general case. The counterexamples that separate them turn to be non-probabilistic NLMP.",10,[],7

We consider tree paths as arms and we assume the target/reward function is drawn from a GP distribution. The posterior mean and variance, after observing data, are used to define confidence intervals for the function values, and we sequentially play arms with highest upper confidence bounds. We give an efficient implementation of GPTS and we adapt previous regret bounds by determining the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the kernel matrix on the whole set of tree paths. We consider two kernels in the feature space of binary vectors indexed by the nodes of the tree: linear and Gaussian. The regret grows in square root of the number of iterations T, up to a logarithmic factor, with a constant that improves with bigger Gaussian kernel widths. We focus on practical values of T, smaller than the number of arms. Finally, we apply GPTS to Open Loop Planning in discounted Markov Decision Processes by modelling the reward as a discounted sum of independent Gaussian Processes. We report similar regret bounds to those of the OLOP algorithm.",10,[],7

1012.2995,cs,"We propose a light-weight approach for certification of monitor inlining for sequential Java bytecode using proof-carrying code. The goal is to enable the use of monitoring for quality assurance at development time, while minimizing the need for post-shipping code rewrites as well as changes to the end-host TCB. Standard automaton-based security policies express constraints on allowed API call/return sequences. Proofs are represented as JML-style program annotations. This is adequate in our case as all proofs generated in our framework are recognized in time polynomial in the size of the program. Policy adherence is proved by comparing the transitions of an inlined monitor with those of a trusted ""ghost"" monitor represented using JML-style annotations. At time of receiving a program with proof annotations, it is sufficient for the receiver to plug in its own trusted ghost monitor and check the resulting verification conditions, to verify that inlining has been performed correctly, of the correct policy. We have proved correctness of the approach at the Java bytecode level and formalized the proof of soundness in Coq.

Further, multi-rate system make the analysis of throughput more complicated. In mobile scenario, link may break or be created as nodes are moving within communication range. `Route Discovery' which is to find the optimal route and transmission schedule is an important issue. Route discovery entails some cost; so one would not like to initiate discovery too often. On the other hand, not discovering reasonably often entails the risk of being stuck with a suboptimal route and/or schedule, which hurts end-to-end throughput. The implementation of the routing decision problem in one dimensional mobile ad hoc network as Markov decision process problem is already is discussed in the paper [1]. A heuristic based on threshold policy is discussed in the same paper without giving a way to find the threshold. In this paper, we suggested a rule for setting the threshold, given the parameters of the system.

1009.1904,cs,"We give efficient data-oblivious algorithms for several fundamental geometric problems that are relevant to geographic information systems, including planar convex hulls and all-nearest neighbors. Our methods are ""data-oblivious"" in that they don't perform any data-dependent operations, with the exception of operations performed inside low-level blackbox circuits having a constant number of inputs and outputs. Thus, an adversary who observes the control flow of one of our algorithms, but who cannot see the inputs and outputs to the blackbox circuits, cannot learn anything about the input or output. This behavior makes our methods applicable to secure multiparty computation (SMC) protocols for geographic data used in location-based services. In SMC protocols, multiple parties wish to perform a computation on their combined data without revealing individual data to the other parties. For instance, our methods can be used to solve a problem posed by Du and Atallah, where Alice has a set, A, of m private points in the plane, Bob has another set, B, of n private points in the plane, and Alice and Bob want to jointly compute the convex hull of A u B without disclosing any more information than what can be derived from the answer.

""Scalable"" means that the allocation does not depend on the units in which the valuations are measured. We deduce from this that any scalable computationally-efficient incentive-compatible auction for equation items and equation bidders cannot approximate the social welfare to within a factor better than 2.

Information is collected and indexed.   * Concurrency: Work proceeds interactively and concurrently, overlapping in time.   * Quasi-commutativity: Information can be used regardless of whether it initiates new work or become relevant to ongoing work.   * Sponsorship: Sponsors provide resources for computation, i.e., processing, storage, and communications.   * Pluralism: Information is heterogeneous, overlapping and often inconsistent.   * Provenance: The provenance of information is carefully tracked and recorded   The Actor Model is intended to provide a foundation for inconsistency robust information integration",10,[],7
1004.3051,cs,"In the highway problem, we are given an n-edge line graph (the highway), and a set of paths (the drivers), each one with its own budget. For a given assignment of edge weights (the tolls), the highway owner collects from each driver the weight of the associated path, when it does not exceed the budget of the driver, and zero otherwise. The goal is choosing weights so as to maximize the profit.   A lot of research has been devoted to this apparently simple problem. The highway problem was shown to be strongly NP-hard only recently [Elbassioni,Raman,Ray-'09]. The best-known approximation is O(\log n/\log\log n) [Gamzu,Segev-'10], which improves on the previous-best O(\log n) approximation [Balcan,Blum-'06].   In this paper we present a PTAS for the highway problem, hence closing the complexity status of the problem. Our result is based on a novel randomized dissection approach, which has some points in common with Arora's quadtree dissection for Euclidean network design [Arora-'98]. The basic idea is enclosing the highway in a bounding path, such that both the size of the bounding path and the position of the highway in it are random variables. Then we consider a recursive O(1)-ary dissection of the bounding path, in subpaths of uniform optimal weight. Since the optimal weights are unknown, we construct the dissection in a bottom-up fashion via dynamic programming, while computing the approximate solution at the same time. Our algorithm can be easily derandomized. We demonstrate the versatility of our technique by presenting PTASs for two variants of the highway problem: the tollbooth problem with a constant number of leaves and the maximum-feasibility subsystem problem on interval matrices. In both cases the previous best approximation factors are polylogarithmic [Gamzu,Segev-'10,Elbassioni,Raman,Ray,Sitters-'09].",10,[],7

In this paper, we propose two new types of probabilistic graphical models, large margin Boltzmann machines (LMBMs) and large margin sigmoid belief networks (LMSBNs), for structured prediction. LMSBNs in particular allow a very fast inference algorithm for arbitrary graph structures that runs in polynomial time with a high probability. This probability is data-distribution dependent and is maximized in learning. The new approach overcomes the representation-efficiency trade-off in previous models and allows fast structured prediction with complicated graph structures.

In learning theory terms, weak agnostic learning of monomials is hard, even if one is allowed to output a hypothesis from the much bigger concept class of halfspaces. This hardness result subsumes a long line of previous results, including two recent hardness results for the proper learning of monomials and halfspaces. As an immediate corollary of our result we show that weak agnostic learning of decision lists is NP-hard.   Our techniques are quite different from previous hardness proofs for learning. We define distributions on positive and negative examples for monomials whose first few moments match. We use the invariance principle to argue that regular halfspaces (all of whose coefficients have small absolute value relative to the total equation norm) cannot distinguish between distributions whose first few moments match. For highly non-regular subspaces, we use a structural lemma from recent work on fooling halfspaces to argue that they are 'junta-like' and one can zero out all but the top few coefficients without affecting the performance of the halfspace. The top few coefficients form the natural list decoding of a halfspace in the context of dictatorship tests/Label Cover reductions.   We note that unlike previous invariance principle based proofs which are only known to give Unique-Games hardness, we are able to reduce from a version of Label Cover problem that is known to be NP-hard.

We improve upon Canny's gap theorem \citec-crmp-87 by a factor of equation, where equation bounds the degree of the polynomials, and equation is the number of variables. One application is to the bitsize of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an integer matrix, which also yields a new proof that the problem is polynomial. We also compare against recent lower bounds on the absolute value of the root coordinates by Brownawell and Yap \citeby-issac-2009, obtained under the hypothesis there is a 0-dimensional projection.

1007.2694,cs,"In Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network systems, content (object) delivery between nodes is often required. One way to study such a distributed system is by defining games, which involve selfish nodes that make strategic choices on replicating content in their local limited memory (cache) or accessing content from other nodes for a cost. These Selfish Replication games have been introduced in [8] for nodes that do not have any capacity limits, leaving the capacitated problem, i.e. Capacitated Selfish Replication (CSR) games, open.   In this work, we first form the model of the CSR games, for which we perform a Nash equilibria analysis. In particular, we focus on hierarchical networks, given their extensive use to model communication costs of content delivery in P2P systems. We present an exact polynomial-time algorithm for any hierarchical network, under two constraints on the utility functions: 1) ""Nearer is better"", i.e. the closest the content is to the node the less its access cost is, and 2) ""Independence of irrelevant alternatives"", i.e. aggregation of individual node preferences. This generalization represents a vast class of utilities and more interestingly allows each of the nodes to have simultaneously completely different functional forms of utility functions. In this general framework, we present CSR games results on arbitrary networks and outline the boundary between intractability and effective computability in terms of the network structure, object preferences, and the total number of objects.

1005.0644,cs,"The direct product problem is a fundamental question in complexity theory which seeks to understand how the difficulty of computing a function on each of k independent inputs scales with k. We prove the following direct product theorem (DPT) for query complexity: if every T-query algorithm has success probability at most 1 - eps in computing the Boolean function f on input distribution Mu, then for alpha <= 1, every (alpha eps Tk)-query algorithm has success probability at most (2alpha eps(1 - eps))k in computing the k-fold direct product fk correctly on k independent inputs from Mu. In light of examples due to Shaltiel, this statement gives an essentially optimal tradeoff between the query bound and the error probability. As a corollary, we show that for an absolute constant alpha > 0, the worst-case success probability of any (alpha R2(f)k)-query randomized algorithm for fk falls exponentially with k.

1006.4550,cs,"An application security has two primary goals: first, it is intended to prevent unauthorised personnel from accessing information at higher classification than their authorisation. Second, it is intended to prevent personnel from declassifying information. Using an object oriented approach to implementing application security results not only with the problem of code scattering and code tangling, but also results in weaker enforcement of security. This weaker enforcement of security could be due to the inherent design of the system or due to a programming error. Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) complements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by providing another way of thinking about program structure. The key unit of modularity in OOP is the class, whereas in AOP the unit of modularity is the aspect. The goal of the paper is to present that Aspect Oriented Programming AspectJ integrated with Spring AOP provides very powerful mechanisms for stronger enforcement of security.Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) allows weaving a security aspect into an application providing additional security functionality or introducing completely new security mechanisms.Implementation of security with AOP is a flexible method to develop separated, extensible and reusable pieces of code called aspects.In this comparative study paper, we argue that Spring AOP provides stronger enforcement of security than AspectJ.We have shown both Spring AOP and AspectJ strive to provide a comprehensive AOP solutions and complements each other.",10,[],7

1012.3216,cs,"In this paper, we show how to efficiently and effectively extract a class of ""low-rank textures"" in a 3D scene from 2D images despite significant corruptions and warping. The low-rank textures capture geometrically meaningful structures in an image, which encompass conventional local features such as edges and corners as well as all kinds of regular, symmetric patterns ubiquitous in urban environments and man-made objects. Our approach to finding these low-rank textures leverages the recent breakthroughs in convex optimization that enable robust recovery of a high-dimensional low-rank matrix despite gross sparse errors. In the case of planar regions with significant affine or projective deformation, our method can accurately recover both the intrinsic low-rank texture and the precise domain transformation, and hence the 3D geometry and appearance of the planar regions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that this new technique works effectively for many regular and near-regular patterns or objects that are approximately low-rank, such as symmetrical patterns, building facades, printed texts, and human faces.",10,[],7

For secure group communication in an Ad hoc network, a group key shared by all group members is required.

The idea is to divide the group into subgroups, each maintaining its subgroup keys using Group Diffie-Hellman (GDH) Protocol and links with other subgroups in a Tree structure using Tree-based Group Diffie-Hellman (TGDH) protocol. By introducing region-based approach, messages and key updates will be limited within subgroup and outer group; hence computation load is distributed among many hosts.

The accuracy of our model is established through comparisons against frequency-domain, Teukolsky-based waveforms in the radiative approximation. The calibration of eight high-order post-Newtonian parameters in the energy flux suffices to obtain a phase and fractional amplitude agreement of better than 1 radian and 1 % respectively over a period between 2 and 6 months depending on the system considered. This agreement translates into matches higher than 97 % over a period between 4 and 9 months, depending on the system. Better agreements can be obtained if a larger number of calibration parameters are included. Higher-order mass ratio terms in the effective-one-body Hamiltonian and radiation-reaction introduce phase corrections of at most 30 radians in a one year evolution.

In this work, we use a set of source catalogues from astrophysically motivated models of massive black hole binary formation and assume a one year LISA mission lifetime. Depending on the model in question, the initial eccentricities in the final year of the inspiral can be as high as 0.6 for high mass seeds and 0.8 for low mass seeds.

Further, we show that the response of the rotating detector can be computed \it exactly\vee (albeit, numerically) even when it is coupled to a field that is governed by a non-linear dispersion relation.

In this paper, we introduce a hybrid method that incorporates elements of PN and BHP theories, and we apply it to the head-on collision of black holes with transverse, anti-parallel spins. We compare our approximation technique with a full numerical-relativity simulation, and we find good agreement between the gravitational waveforms and the radiated energy and momentum.

1006.5088,gr-qc,"The covariance group for general relativity, the diffeomorphisms, is replaced by a group of coordinate transformations which contains the diffeomorphisms as a proper subgroup. The larger group is defined by the assumption that all observers will agree whether any given quantity is conserved. Alternatively, and equivalently, it is defined by the assumption that all observers will agree that the general relativistic wave equation describes the propagation of light. Thus, the group replacement is analogous to the replacement of the Lorentz group by the diffeomorphisms that led Einstein from special relativity to general relativity, and is also consistent with the assumption of constant light velocity that led him to special relativity. The enlarged covariance group leads to a non-commutative geometry based not on a manifold, but on a nonlocal space in which paths, rather than points, are the most primitive invariant entities.

1011.2961,gr-qc,We study the classical field theoretical formulation of static generic isolated horizons in a manifestly SU(2) invariant formulation. We show that the usual classical description requires revision in the non-static case due to the breaking of diffeomorphism invariance at the horizon leading to the non conservation of the usual pre-symplectic structure. We argue how this difficulty could be avoided by a simple enlargement of the field content at the horizon that restores diffeomorphism invariance. Restricting our attention to static isolated horizons we study the effective theories describing the boundary degrees of freedom. A quantization of the horizon degrees of freedom is proposed. By defining a statistical mechanical ensemble where only the area A of the horizon is fixed macroscopically-states with fluctuations away from spherical symmetry are allowed-we show that it is possible to obtain agreement with the Hawking's area law---S = A/4 (in Planck Units)---without fixing the Immirzi parameter to any particular value: consistency with the area law only imposes a relationship between the Immirzi parameter and the level of the Chern-Simons theory involved in the effective description of the horizon degrees of freedom.,10,[],13

Specifically, to illustrate our findings, we describe the following three physical situations: (1) a cylindrical impulsive gravitational wave propagating into a universe with a magnetic field, (2) an axially symmetric impulsive gravitational wave propagating into a universe with an electric field and (3) a `spherical' impulsive gravitational wave propagating into a universe with a small magnetic field. In cases (1) and (3) electromagnetic radiation is produced behind the gravitational wave.

I use an adaptive-mesh-refinement (AMR) time-domain numerical integration of the perturbation equations in the Barack-Ori mode-sum regularization formalism; this is efficient, yet allows easy generalization to arbitrary particle orbits. I focus on the model problem of a scalar particle in a circular geodesic orbit in Schwarzschild spacetime.   The mode-sum formalism gives the self-force as an infinite sum of regularized spherical-harmonic modes equation, with equation (and an ""internal"" error estimate) computed numerically for equation and estimated for larger~equation by fitting an asymptotic ""tail"" series. Here I validate the internal error estimates for the individual equation using a large set of numerical self-force computations of widely-varying accuracies. I present numerical evidence that the actual numerical errors in equation for different~equation are at most weakly correlated, so the usual statistical error estimates are valid for computing the self-force. I show that the tail fit is numerically ill-conditioned, but this can be mostly alleviated by renormalizing the basis functions to have similar magnitudes.

As is well known, this choice leads to a ""burst"" of junk radiation which eventually propagates off the computational domain. We observe another unintended consequence of trivial initial data: development of a persistent spurious solution, here referred to as the Jost junk solution, which contaminates the physical solution for long times. This work studies the influence of both types of junk on metric perturbations, waveforms, and self-force measurements, and it demonstrates that smooth modified source terms mollify the Jost solution and reduce junk radiation.

1004.2276,gr-qc,"In this, the first of two companion papers, we present a method for finding the gravitational self-force in a modified radiation gauge for a particle moving on a geodesic in a Schwarzschild or Kerr spacetime. An extension of an earlier result by Wald is used to show the spin-weight equation perturbed Weyl scalar (equation or equation) determines the metric perturbation outside the particle up to a gauge transformation and an infinitesimal change in mass and angular momentum. A Hertz potential is used to construct the part of the retarded metric perturbation that involves no change in mass or angular momentum from equation in a radiation gauge. The metric perturbation is completed by adding changes in the mass and angular momentum of the background spacetime outside the radial coordinate equation of the particle in any convenient gauge. The resulting metric perturbation is singular on the trajectory of the particle and discontinuous across the sphere equation.

At the same time, our approach differs significantly. The main one is that while for them the gauge symmetry group is equation, here we consider only symmetries generated by its even subgroup, i.e., symmetries of the standard electroweak model. The reason is that such formalism fixes the quartic Higgs coupling and at the same time removes the sign and statistics problems. The main result is that the presented model predicts values of the Weinberg angle and the Higgs mass correctly up to the two-loop level. Moreover, the model sets the unification scale coinciding with the electroweak scale and automatically describes the fermions correctly with the correct quark and lepton charges.",10,[],2

The appearance and disappearance far-detection processes are described from the time evolution of this disentangled ""collapsed"" state. The familiar quantum mechanical interpretation and factorization of the detection rate emerges when the quantum state is disentangled on time scales \emphmuch shorter than the inverse oscillation frequency, in which case the final detection rate factorizes in terms of the usual quantum mechanical transition probability provided the final density of states is insensitive to the neutrino energy difference. We suggest \emphpossible corrections for short-baseline experiments. If the charged lepton is unobserved, neutrino oscillations and coherence are described in terms of a reduced density matrix obtained by tracing out an un-observed charged lepton. The diagonal elements in the mass basis describe the production of mass eigenstates whereas the off diagonal ones provide a measure of coherence.

This prediction explains recent HERA data. The calculations which follow perturbative Pomeron logic predict opposite trend of a weaker equation dependence at larger equation.

However, they are significantly more complicated than event shapes at ee- colliders, involving multiple hard directions, multiple channels and multiple color structures. In this paper, hadronic event shapes are examined with Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) by expanding around the dijet limit. A simple event shape, threshold thrust, is defined. This observable is global and has no free parameters, making it ideal for clarifying how resummation of hadronic event shapes can be done in SCET. Threshold thrust is calculated at next-to-leading fixed order (NLO) in SCET and resummed to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy (NNLL). The scale-dependent parts of the soft function are shown to agree with what is expected from general observations, and the factorization formula is explicitly shown to be renormalization group invariant to 1-loop. Although threshold thrust is not itself expected to be phenomenologically interesting, it can be modified into a related observable which allows the jet pT distribution to be calculated and resummed to NNLLNLO accuracy. As in other processes, one expects resummation to be important even for moderate jet momenta due to dynamical threshold enhancement.

We determine the phase diagram of the PQM model in the FRG approach and discuss its modification in comparison with the one obtained under the mean-field approximation. We focus on properties of the net-quark number density fluctuations as well as their higher moments and discuss the influence of non-perturbative effects on their properties near the chiral crossover transition. We show, that with an increasing net-quark number density the higher order moments exhibit a peculiar structure near the phase transition. We also consider ratios of different moments of the net-quark number density and discuss their role as probes of deconfinement and chiral phase transitions.",10,[],2
1001.0940,hep-ph,"Neutrino oscillation data strongly support mu-tau symmetry as a good approximate flavor symmetry of the neutrino sector, which has to appear in any viable theory for neutrino mass-generation. The mu-tau breaking is not only small, but also the source of Dirac CP-violation. We conjecture that both discrete mu-tau and CP symmetries are fundamental symmetries of the seesaw Lagrangian (respected by interaction terms), and they are only softly broken, arising from a common origin via a unique dimension-3 Majorana mass-term of the heavy right-handed neutrinos. From this conceptually attractive and simple construction, we can predict the soft mu-tau breaking at low energies, leading to quantitative correlations between the apparently two small deviations letter23 - 45o and letter13 - 0o. This nontrivially connects the on-going measurements of mixing angle letter23 with the upcoming experimental probes of letter13. We find that any deviation of letter23 - 45o must put a lower limit on letter13. Furthermore, we deduce the low energy Dirac and Majorana CP violations from a common soft-breaking phase associated with mu-tau breaking in the neutrino seesaw. Finally, from the soft CP breaking in neutrino seesaw we derive the cosmological CP violation for the baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis. We fully reconstruct the leptogenesis CP-asymmetry from the low energy Dirac CP phase and establish a direct link between the cosmological CP-violation and the low energy Jarlskog invariant. We predict new lower and upper bounds on the letter13 mixing angle, 1o < letter13 < 6o. In addition, we reveal a new hidden symmetry that dictates the solar mixing angle letter12 by its group-parameter, and includes the conventional tri-bimaximal mixing as a special case, allowing deviations from it.",10,[],2

Here we explicitly compute the non-perturbative corrections to the D7/D3 system in type I' due to D-instantons. This computation provides both the quartic effective action on the D7 branes and the quadratic effective action on the D3 brane; the latter agrees with the F-theoretic prediction. The action obtained in this way is related to the one derived from the usual instanton calculus \`a la Nekrasov (or from its AGT realization in terms of Liouville conformal blocks) by means of a non-perturbative redefinition of the coupling constant. We also point out an intriguing relation between the four-dimensional theory on the probe D3 brane, which has a SO(8) flavor symmetry, and the eight-dimensional dynamics on the D7 branes. On the latter, SO(8) represents a gauge group and the flavor masses correspond to the vacuum expectation values of an adjoint scalar field m: what we find is that the exact effective coupling in four dimensions is obtained from its perturbative part by taking into account in its mass dependence the full quantum dynamics of the field m in eight dimensions.",10,[],4

We find that the aforementioned identification of FZZT branes is spoiled by terms that do not admit an interpretation as non-universal terms. Furthermore, the spoiling terms as computed using the matrix model are found to be in agreement with those coming from Liouville theory, which also suggests that these terms have universal meaning. Finally, we also investigate the identification of FZZT branes by replacing the boundary state with a sum of local operators. We find in this case that the brane associated with the identity operator appears to be special as it is the only one to correctly reproduce the correlation numbers for bulk operators on the torus.",10,[],4

In the limit of large quantum numbers the treatment of vertex operators becomes semiclassical. In this regime, a given vertex operator carrying a certain set of quantum numbers defines a singular solution. We show in a number of examples that this solution coincides with the classical string solution with the same quantum numbers but written in a different two-dimensional coordinate system. The marginality condition imposed on an operator yields a relation between the energy and the other quantum numbers which is shown to coincide with that of the corresponding classical string solution.

1012.6032,hep-th,"Recently, an explicit, recursive formula for the all-loop integrand of planar scattering amplitudes in N=4 SYM has been described, generalizing the BCFW formula for tree amplitudes, and making manifest the Yangian symmetry of the theory. This has made it possible to easily study the structure of multi-loop amplitudes in the theory. In this paper we describe a remarkable fact revealed by these investigations: the integrand can be expressed in an amazingly simple and manifestly local form when represented in momentum-twistor space using a set of chiral integrals with unit leading singularities. As examples, we present very-concise expressions for all 2- and 3-loop MHV integrands, as well as all 2-loop NMHV integrands. We also describe a natural set of manifestly IR-finite integrals that can be used to express IR-safe objects such as the ratio function. Along the way we give a pedagogical introduction to the foundations of the subject. The new local forms of the integrand are closely connected to leading singularities---matching only a small subset of all leading singularities remarkably suffices to determine the full integrand. These results strongly suggest the existence of a theory for the integrand directly yielding these local expressions, allowing for a more direct understanding of the emergence of local spacetime physics.",10,[],4
1008.2944,hep-th,"It is known from earlier work of Iqbal, Liu (arXiv:0809.3808) that the boundary transport coefficients such as electrical conductivity (at vanishing chemical potential), shear viscosity etc. at low frequency and finite temperature can be expressed in terms of geometrical quantities evaluated at the horizon. In the case of electrical conductivity, at zero chemical potential gauge field fluctuation and metric fluctuation decouples, resulting in a trivial flow from horizon to boundary. In the presence of chemical potential, the story becomes complicated due to the fact that gauge field and metric fluctuation can no longer be decoupled. This results in a nontrivial flow from horizon to boundary. Though horizon conductivity can be expressed in terms of geometrical quantities evaluated at the horizon, there exist no such neat result for electrical conductivity at the boundary. In this paper we propose an expression for boundary conductivity expressed in terms of geometrical quantities evaluated at the horizon and thermodynamical quantities. We also consider the theory at finite cutoff outside the horizon (arXiv:1006.1902) and give an expression for cutoff dependent electrical conductivity, which interpolates smoothly between horizon conductivity and boundary conductivity .

We find that in nearly all cases at least some of them are massless. However, we identify a large subclass where the fractional charges are at worst half-integer, and often vector-like. The number of families is very often reduced in comparison to the 1989 results, but there are no new tensor combinations yielding three families. All tensor combinations turn out to fall into two classes: those where the number of families is always divisible by three, and those where it is never divisible by three. We find an empirical rule to determine the class, which appears to extend beyond minimal N=2 tensor products. We observe that distributions of physical quantities such as the number of families, singlets and mirrors have an interesting tendency towards smaller values as the gauge groups approaches the Standard Model. We compare our results with an analogous class of free fermionic models. This displays similar features, but with less resolution.Finally we present a complete scan of the three family models based on the triply-exceptional combination (1,16*,16*,16*) identified originally by Gepner.

The goal of our study is both methodological and physical. We assess merits and limitations concerning small- and large-scale resolution/accuracy of the adopted integration scheme. We discuss quantitatively the requirements needed to keep the method stable and precise enough to simulate stratified and unstratified flows driven by thermal active fluctuations at high Rayleigh and high Reynolds numbers. We present data with spatial resolution up to 4096 x 10000 grid points and Rayleigh number up to Ra ~ 1011 . The statistical quality of the data allows us to investigate velocity and temperature fluctuations, scale-by-scale, over roughly four decades. We present a detailed quantitative analysis of scaling laws in the viscous, inertial and integral range, supporting the existence of a Bolgiano-like inertial scaling, as expected in 2d systems. We also discuss the presence of small/large intermittent deviation to the scaling of velocity/temperature fluctuations and the Rayleigh dependency of gradients flatness.",10,[],9

The implications of this q-logistic map on Parrondo's paradox are examined.",10,[],9
1009.1007,nlin,"We investigate effects of dipole-dipole (DD) interactions on immiscibility-miscibility transitions (IMTs) in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) trapped in the harmonic-oscillator (HO) potential, with the components linearly coupled by a resonant electromagnetic field (accordingly, the components represent two different spin states of the same atom). The problem is studied by means of direct numerical simulations. Different mutual orientations of the dipolar moments in the two components are considered. It is shown that, in the binary BEC formed by dipoles with the same orientation and equal magnitudes, the IMT cannot be induced by the DD interaction alone, being possible only in the presence of the linear coupling between the components, while the miscibility threshold is affected by the DD interactions. However, in the binary condensate with the two dipolar components polarized in opposite directions, the IMT can be induced \emphwithout any linear coupling. Further, we demonstrate that those miscible and immiscible localized states, formed in the presence of the DD interactions, which are unstable evolve into robust breathers, which tend to keep the original miscibility or immiscibility, respectively. An exception is the case of a very strong DD attraction, when narrow stationary modes are destroyed by the instability. The binary BEC composed of co-polarized dipoles with different magnitudes are briefly considered too.",10,[],9

By solving the equation analytically, we find that the structure of solutions differs substantially from that of the former equation. In particular, we show that the equation exhibits kink and breather solutions and does not admit multi-valued solutions like loop solitons as obtained in I. We also demonstrate that the equation reduces to the short pulse and sG equations in appropriate scaling limits. The limiting forms of the multisoliton solutions are also presented.

Previous studies of escape in chaotic systems have rather focused on the case of unbounded noise, usually assumed to have Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we address the problem of escape induced by bounded noise. We show that the dynamics of escape from an attractor's basin is equivalent to that of a closed system with an appropriately chosen ""hole"". Using this equivalence, we show that there is a minimum noise amplitude above which escape takes place, and we derive analytical expressions for the scaling of the escape rate with noise amplitude near the escape transition.

It is shown that the solutions obtained by Yomba [1], when using the so-called auxiliary equation method, can be reached by mapping them into some known nonlinear equations. This is achieved through a suitable sequence of translation and power-like transformations. Particularly, the parent-like equations used here are the ones for the equation model and the Weierstrass equation. This last one, allow us to get oscillating solutions for the models under analysis.

We study three different compacton solutions and find they are numerically stable. Similar to the collisions between RH compactons, the CSS compactons reemerge with same coherent shape when scattered. The time evolution of the small-amplitude ripple resulting after scattering depends on the values of the parameters equation and equation characterizing the corresponding CSS equation.

These groups admit a very natural lattice structure. Each Schlesinger transformation induces a Backlund transformation of the equation-Painlev\'e equation.

It was shown that for the conservative time-dependent dynamics the model exhibits the Fermi acceleration [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 014103 (2008)]. On the other hand, it was observed that damping coefficients upon collisions suppress such phenomenon [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 224101 (2010)]. Here, we consider a dissipative model under the presence of in-flight dissipation due to a drag force which is assumed to be proportional to the square of the particle's velocity.

1002.3363,nlin,"The appearance of infinitely-many period-doubling cascades is one of the most prominent features observed in the study of maps depending on a parameter. They are associated with chaotic behavior, since bifurcation diagrams of a map with a parameter often reveal a complicated intermingling of period-doubling cascades and chaos. Period doubling can be studied at three levels of complexity. The first is an individual period-doubling bifurcation. The second is an infinite collection of period doublings that are connected together by periodic orbits in a pattern called a cascade. It was first described by Myrberg and later in more detail by Feigenbaum. The third involves infinitely many cascades and a parameter value equation of the map at which there is chaos. We show that often virtually all (i.e., all but finitely many) 'regular' periodic orbits at equation are each connected to exactly one cascade by a path of regular periodic orbits; and virtually all cascades are either paired -- connected to exactly one other cascade, or solitary -- connected to exactly one regular periodic orbit at equation. The solitary cascades are robust to large perturbations. Hence the investigation of infinitely many cascades is essentially reduced to studying the regular periodic orbits of equation. Examples discussed include the forced-damped pendulum and the double-well Duffing equation.",10,[],9
1008.5074,nlin,"We briefly review and highlight the consequences of rigorous and exact results obtained in \citecessac:10, characterizing the statistics of spike trains in a network of leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons, where time is discrete and where neurons are subject to noise, without restriction on the synaptic weights connectivity. The main result is that spike trains statistics are characterized by a Gibbs distribution, whose potential is explicitly computable. This establishes, on one hand, a rigorous ground for the current investigations attempting to characterize real spike trains data with Gibbs distributions, such as the Ising-like distribution, using the maximal entropy principle. However, it transpires from the present analysis that the Ising model might be a rather weak approximation. Indeed, the Gibbs potential (the formal ""Hamiltonian"") is the log of the so-called ""conditional intensity"" (the probability that a neuron fires given the past of the whole network). But, in the present example, this probability has an infinite memory, and the corresponding process is non-Markovian (resp. the Gibbs potential has infinite range). Moreover, causality implies that the conditional intensity does not depend on the state of the neurons at the \textitsame time, ruling out the Ising model as a candidate for an exact characterization of spike trains statistics. However, Markovian approximations can be proposed whose degree of approximation can be rigorously controlled. In this setting, Ising model appears as the ""next step"" after the Bernoulli model (independent neurons) since it introduces spatial pairwise correlations, but not time correlations. The range of validity of this approximation is discussed together with possible approaches allowing to introduce time correlations, with algorithmic extensions.",10,[],9
1004.0751,nlin,"In the paper we first investigate symmetries of isospectral and non-isospectral four-potential Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchies.

Then by means of the zero-curvature representations of the isospectral and non-isospectral flows, we construct symmetries for the isospectral equation hierarchy as well as non-isospectral equation hierarchy, respectively. The symmetries, respectively, form two centerless Kac-Moody-Virasoro algebras. The recursion operator equation is proved to be hereditary and a strong symmetry for this isospectral equation hierarchy. Besides, we make clear for the relation between four-potential and two-potential Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchies.

1010.1814,nlin,"It is not uncommon for certain social networks to divide into two opposing camps in response to stress. This happens, for example, in networks of political parties during winner-takes-all elections, in networks of companies competing to establish technical standards, and in networks of nations faced with mounting threats of war. A simple model for these two-sided separations is the dynamical system dX/dt = X2 where X is a matrix of the friendliness or unfriendliness between pairs of nodes in the network. Previous simulations suggested that only two types of behavior were possible for this system: either all relationships become friendly, or two hostile factions emerge. Here we prove that for generic initial conditions, these are indeed the only possible outcomes. Our analysis yields a closed-form expression for faction membership as a function of the initial conditions, and implies that the initial amount of friendliness in large social networks (started from random initial conditions) determines whether they will end up in intractable conflict or global harmony.",10,[],9

Simulations show that the self-organized criticality emerges naturally in the system for a given probability of shortcuts and transition occurs as the probability increases to some critical value indicating the small-world behaviour of the complex automata networks.

Interestingly, a continuous phase transition is observed from the absorbing state to spatiotemporal chaos via spatiotemporal intermittency for a range of values of p. It is interesting to note that the transition falls in class of directed percolation.

In contrast, backward LVs (obtained via Gram-Schmidt orthonormalizations) present approximately the same scaling exponent in all cases, suggesting it is an artificial exponent produced by the imposed orthogonality of these vectors.

The solitons become unstable in the case of the slowly relaxing nonlinearity. The character of the instability alters with the increase of the delay time, which leads to a change in the dynamics of unstable discrete solitons.

1002.0305,nlin,"The transition of a counter chemotactic particle flow from a free-flow state to a jammed state in a quasi-one-dimensional path is investigated. One of the characteristic features of such a flow is that the constituent particles spontaneously form a cluster that blocks the path, called a path-blocking cluster (PBC), and causes a jammed state when the particle density is greater than a threshold value. Near the threshold value, the PBC occasionally desolve itself to recover the free flow. In other words, the time evolution of the size of the PBC governs the flux of a counter chemotactic flow. In this paper, on the basis of numerical results of a stochastic cellular automata (SCA) model, we introduce a Langevin equation model for the size evolution of the PBC that reproduces the qualitative characteristics of the SCA model.

In this context, the network with three populations represents an interesting case because the populations may either be connected as a triangle, or as a chain, thereby representing the simplest discrete network of either a ring or a line segment of oscillator populations. We introduce a special parameter that allows us to study the effect of breaking the triangular network structure, and to vary the network symmetry continuously such that it becomes more and more chain-like. By showing that chimera states only exist for a bounded set of parameter values we demonstrate that their existence depends strongly on the underlying network structures. We conclude that chimeras exist on networks with a chain-like character, which indicates that it might be possible to observe chimeras on a continuous line segment of oscillators.",10,[],9

The population of individual attractors can be controlled by adding small hyperbolic elements to certain parts of the boundary of the billiard. Furthermore, the position of the attractors in momentum space can be adjusted by tuning parameters like the dissipation constant or the driving amplitude and frequency. Thus, the dissipative, driven elliptical billiard represents a powerful tool for particle preparation.",10,[],9

When equation is a uniformly hyperbolic diffeomorphism, it has been proved that the power series equation has a radius of convergence equation, and that equation, but it is known that equation in some other cases. One reason why equation may fail to be uniformly hyperbolic is if there are tangencies between the stable and unstable manifolds for equation. The present paper gives a crude, nonrigorous, analysis of this situation in terms of the Hausdorff dimension equation of equation in the stable direction. We find that the tangencies produce singularities of equation for equation if equation, but only for equation if equation. In particular, if equation we may hope that equation makes sense, and the derivative equation has thus a chance to be defined",10,[],9

Nonetheless for large flocks perturbations in the movement of the leader may grow to a considerable size as they propagate throughout the flock and before they die out over time. As an example we consider a string of N1 oscillators moving in the line. Each one `observes' the relative velocity and position of only its nearest neighbors. This information is then used to determine its own acceleration. Now we fix all parameters except the number of oscillators. We then show (within a certain class of systems) that a perturbation in the leader's orbit is almost always amplified exponentially in N as it propagates towards the outlying members of the flock. The only exception is when there is a symmetry present in the interaction: in that case the growth of the perturbation is linear in N.,10,[],9

A larger cutoff at finite densities leads to a partial chiral symmetry restoration of quark equation at lower densities. A direct consequence is the onset of the equation quark in stellar matter at lower densities and a softening of the equation of state.,10,[],11

1010.6269,nucl-th,"Chiral effective field theory (ChEFT) is a modern framework to analyze the properties of few-nucleon systems at low energies. It is based on the most general effective Lagrangian for pions and nucleons consistent with the chiral symmetry of QCD. For energies below the pion-production threshold it is possible to eliminate the pionic degrees of freedom and derive nuclear potentials and nuclear current operators solely in terms of the nucleonic degrees of freedom. This is very important because, despite a lot of experience gained in the past, the consistency between two-nucleon forces, many-nucleon forces and the corresponding current operators has not been achieved yet. In this presentation we consider the recently derived long-range two-pion exchange (TPE) contributions to the nuclear current operator which appear at next-to leading order of the chiral expansion. These operators do not contain any free parameters. We study their role in the deuteron photodisintegration reaction and compare our predictions with experimental data. The bound and scattering states are calculated using five different chiral N2LO nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials which allows to estimate the theoretical uncertainty at a given order in the chiral expansion.

The analysis is carried out in the mean field framework (Hartree- Fock- Bogoliubov approximation) by using the axially symmetric octupole moment as a constraint. The main ingredients entering the octupole collective Hamiltonian are evaluated and the lowest lying octupole eigenstates are obtained. In this way we restore, in an approximate way, the parity symmetry spontaneously broken by the mean field and also incorporate octupole fluctuations around the ground state solution. For each isotope the energy of the lowest lying equationstate and the equation and equation transition probabilities have been computed and compared to both the experimental data and the results obtained in the same framework with the Gogny D1S interaction, which are used here as a well established benchmark.

In this paper we discuss the extrapolation along the classical trajectories as a method to improve the convergence of the theoretical energy and angular correlations at very large distances (of the order of atomic distances), where only the long-range Coulomb forces are still operating. The precision of this approach is demonstrated using the ""exactly"" solvable semianalytical models with simplified three-body Hamiltonians.

The reason why the plateau condition is met for the Nilsson model but not for the Woods-Saxon model is understood in a new interpretation of the Strutinsky smoothing procedure as a low-pass filter. Essential features of Kruppa's level density is extracted in terms of the Thomas-Fermi approximation modified to describe spectra obtained from diagonalization in truncated oscillator bases. A method is proposed which weakens the dependence on the smoothing width by applying the Strutinsky smoothing only to the deviations from a reference level density. The BCS equations are modified for the Kruppa's spectrum, which is necessary to treat the pairing correlation properly in the presence of continuum. The potential depth is adjusted for the consistency between the microscopic and macroscopic Fermi energies.

Second, the importance of the Green's function matrix-elements far away from the spatial diagonal is analyzed by a suitable suppression process that does not significantly affect the evolution of the elements close to the diagonal.

1006.0219,nucl-th,"The investigation of light nuclei with ab-initio methods provides an optimal setting to probe our knowledge on nuclear forces, because the few-nucleon problem can be solved accurately. Nucleons interact not only in pairs but also via many-body forces. Theoretical efforts need to be taken towards the identification of nuclear observables sensitive to the less known many-nucleon forces. Electromagnetic reactions can potentially provide useful information on this. We present results on photo-absorption and electron scattering off light nuclei, emphasizing the role of three-body forces and the comparison with experimental data. On the other hand, reactions induced by weak probes, like neutrino interactions with nucleonic matter, are relevant to astrophysics and can be calculated with few-body techniques. In this case, since often no experiment is possible, ab-initio predictions provide valuable input for astrophysical simulations.",10,[],11

While the invariant mass spectrum of dielectrons is well understood in the pp collisions, severe discrepancies among different model scenarios based on hadronic degrees of freedom and recent data from the PHENIX Collaboration are found in heavy-ion collisions in the low mass region from 0.15 to 0.6 GeV as well as in the intermediate mass regime from 1.1 to 3 GeV when employing the standard dilepton sources. We investigate, furthermore, the background from correlated dileptons that are not emitted as a pair from a parent hadron but emerge from semileptonic decays of two correlated daughter hadrons.

It is designed to monitor and track the longitudinal motion and attitude of two floating test-masses in the optical reference frame with a (relative) precision in the picometer and nanorad range, respectively. We analyze sensor signal correlations and determine a physical sensor noise limit. The coupling parameters between motional degrees of freedom and interferometer signals are analytically derived and compared to measurements. We also measure adverse cross-coupling effects originating from system imperfections and limitations and describe algorithmic mitigation techniques to overcome some of them. Their impact on system performance is analyzed in the context of the Pathfinder mission.",10,[],5
1002.2268,physics,"In order to identify the extent to which results from topological graph models are useful for modeling vulnerability in electricity infrastructure, we measure the susceptibility of power networks to random failures and directed attacks using three measures of vulnerability: characteristic path lengths, connectivity loss and blackout sizes. The first two are purely topological metrics. The blackout size calculation results from a model of cascading failure in power networks. Testing the response of 40 areas within the Eastern US power grid and a standard IEEE test case to a variety of attack/failure vectors indicates that directed attacks result in larger failures using all three vulnerability measures, but the attack vectors that appear to cause the most damage depend on the measure chosen. While our topological and power grid model results show some trends that are similar, there is only a mild correlation between the vulnerability measures for individual simulations. We conclude that evaluating vulnerability in power networks using purely topological metrics can be misleading.",10,[],5

Both Kitt Peak and MDI data at high latitudes (78equation--90equation) in both solar hemispheres show a significant drop in the absolute value of polar fields from the late declining phase of the solar cycle 22 to the maximum of the solar cycle 23. We find that long term changes in the absolute value of the polar field, in cycle 23, is well correlated with changes in meridional flow speeds that have been reported recently. We discuss the implication of this in influencing the extremely prolonged minimum experienced at the start of the current cycle 24 and in forecasting the behaviour of future solar cycles.",10,[],5

The laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) was observed as the magnetic field was scanned through zero. Signals were recorded for the two orthogonal, linearly polarized components of the LIF. We compared the measured signals with the results of calculations from a model that was based on the optical Bloch equations and averaged over the Doppler profile.

1005.3903,physics,"This study is based on Roman wooden force pumps. It appears that they were used in small numbers to raise water from wells, and more commonly as portable pumps to fight fires. The force pump is attributed to Ctesibius of Alexandria (fl. c.270 B.C.). The earlier examples were made in bronze, but the original design was cleverly re-engineered in Roman times to make pumps easier and cheaper to make and maintain, by cutting apertures in a large block of wood, and making internal spaces pressure proof by plugging their extremities. Eighteen wooden pumps have been found, mostly in wells, and remains of thirteen survive. This study is based on examination of the remains, and of the reports of the Perigueux pump (Dordogne, France). Archaeologists want to fully study the pump, tacking into consideration its efficiency and the mechanical calculations of the possible performance and of the manpower required to drive it. Technical considerations affecting construction, operation, and performance are discussed and requires connections with knowledge fields such as mechanics. A detailed Report is provided on the pump, giving, so far as possible, a complete description of it and all that is currently known about it.

An internal movable mirror shared by both systems allows us to collect the EBE radiation along the same line of sight that is used for EBW heating. The theoretical EBE has been calculated for different orientations of the internal mirror using the TRUBA code as ray tracer.

1008.0833,physics,"The hydrodynamic forces exerted by a fluid on small isolated rigid spherical particles are usually well described by the Maxey-Riley (MR) equation. The most time-consuming contribution in the MR equation is the Basset history force which is a well-known problem for many-particle simulations in turbulence. In this paper a novel numerical approach is proposed for the computation of the Basset history force based on the use of exponential functions to approximate the tail of the Basset force kernel. Typically, this approach not only decreases the cpu time and memory requirements for the Basset force computation by more than an order of magnitude, but also increases the accuracy by an order of magnitude. The method has a temporal accuracy of O(Delta t2) which is a substantial improvement compared to methods available in the literature. Furthermore, the method is partially implicit in order to increase stability of the computation. Traditional methods for the calculation of the Basset history force can influence statistical properties of the particles in isotropic turbulence, which is due to the error made by approximating the Basset force and the limited number of particles that can be tracked with classical methods. The new method turns out to provide more reliable statistical data.",10,[],5

1002.2355,physics,"Numerical ab initio variational calculations of the transition probabilities and ac Stark shifts in two-photon transitions of antiprotonic helium atoms driven by two counter-propagating laser beams are presented. We found that sub-Doppler spectroscopy is in principle possible by exciting transitions of the type (n,L)->(n-2,L-2) between antiprotonic states of principal and angular momentum quantum numbers n~L-1~35, first by using highly monochromatic, nanosecond laser beams of intensities 104-105 W/cm2, and then by tuning the virtual intermediate state close (e.g., within 10-20 GHz) to the real state (n-1,L-1) to enhance the nonlinear transition probability. We expect that ac Stark shifts of a few MHz or more will become an important source of systematic error at fractional precisions of better than a few parts in 109. These shifts can in principle be minimized and even canceled by selecting an optimum combination of laser intensities and frequencies. We simulated the resonance profiles of some two-photon transitions in the regions n=30-40 of the \barp4He and \barp 3He isotopes to find the best conditions that would allow this.",10,[],5
1009.1531,physics,"We present novel hysteretic behaviour of a three-level ladder atomic system exhibiting double-cavity optical bistability in the mean-field limit. The two fields coupling the atomic system experience feedback via two independent, unidirectional, single mode ring cavities and exhibit cooperative phenomena, simultaneously. The system displays a range of rich dynamical features varying from normal switching to self pulsing and a period-doubling route to chaos for both the fields. We focus our attention to a new hump like feature in the bistable curve arising purely due to cavity induced inversion, which eventually leads to negative hysteresis in the bistable response. This is probably the only all-optical bistable system that exhibits positive as well as negative bistable hysteresis in different input field intensity regimes. For both the fields, the switching times, the associated critical slowing down, the self-pulsing characteristics, and the chaotic behaviour can be controlled to a fair degree, moreover, all these effects occur at low input light levels.",10,[],5

1008.4959,physics,"We argue that magnetic flux-conservation in turbulent plasmas at high magnetic Reynolds numbers neither holds in the conventional sense nor is entirely broken, but instead is valid in a novel statistical sense associated to the ""spontaneous stochasticity"" of Lagrangian particle tra jectories. The latter phenomenon is due to the explosive separation of particles undergoing turbulent Richardson diffusion, which leads to a breakdown of Laplacian determinism for classical dynamics. We discuss empirical evidence for spontaneous stochasticity, including our own new numerical results. We then use a Lagrangian path-integral approach to establish stochastic flux-freezing for resistive hydromagnetic equations and to argue, based on the properties of Richardson diffusion, that flux-conservation must remain stochastic at infinite magnetic Reynolds number. As an important application of these results we consider the kinematic, fluctuation dynamo in non-helical, incompressible turbulence at unit magnetic Prandtl number. We present results on the Lagrangian dynamo mechanisms by a stochastic particle method which demonstrate a strong similarity between the Pr = 1 and Pr = 0 dynamos. Stochasticity of field-line motion is an essential ingredient of both. We finally consider briefly some consequences for nonlinear MHD turbulence, dynamo and reconnection",10,[],5
1012.0852,physics,"We report what we believe to be the lowest phase noise optical-to-microwave frequency division using fiber-based femtosecond optical frequency combs: a residual phase noise of -120dBc/Hz at 1 Hz offset from a 11.55GHz carrier frequency. We furthermore report a detailed investigation into the fundamental noise sources which afflicts the division process itself. Two frequency combs with quasi-identical configurations are referenced to a common ultrastable cavity laser source. To identify each of the limiting effects we implement an ultra-low noise carrier-suppression measurement system, which circumvents the detection and amplification noise of more conventional techniques. This technique now allows the suppression of these unwanted sources of noise to very low levels. In the Fourier frequency range of ~200 Hz to 100 kHz, a fed-forward technique based on a voltage-controlled phase shifter delivers a further noise reduction of 10 dB. For lower Fourier frequencies, optical power stabilization is implemented in order to reduce the relative intensity noise which causes unwanted phase noise through power to phase conversion in the detector. We implement and compare two possible control schemes based on an acousto-optical modulator and comb pump current. We also present wideband measurements on the relative intensity noise of the fiber comb.",10,[],5

1012.0048,physics,"Purpose: Many planning methods for high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy treatment planning require an iterative approach. A set of computational parameters are hypothesized that will give a dose plan that meets dosimetric criteria. A dose plan is computed using these parameters, and if any dosimetric criteria are not met, the process is iterated until a suitable dose plan is found. In this way, the dose distribution is controlled by abstract parameters. The purpose of this study is to improve HDR brachytherapy planning by developing a new approach that directly optimizes the dose distribution based on dosimetric criteria.   Method: We develop Inverse Planning by Integer Program (IPIP), an optimization model for computing HDR brachytherapy dose plans and a fast heuristic for it. We used our heuristic to compute dose plans for 20 anonymized prostate cancer patient image data sets from our clinic database. Dosimetry was evaluated and compared to dosimetric criteria.   Results: Dose plans computed from IPIP satisfied all given dosimetric criteria for the target and healthy tissue after a single iteration. The average target coverage was 95%. The average computation time for IPIP was 30.1 seconds on a Intel(R) CoreTM2 Duo CPU 1.67 GHz processor with 3 Gib RAM.   Conclusion: IPIP is an HDR brachytherapy planning system that directly incorporates dosimetric criteria. We have demonstrated that IPIP has clinically acceptable performance for the prostate cases and dosimetric criteria used in this study, both in terms of dosimetry and runtime. Further study is required to determine if IPIP performs well for a more general group of patients and dosimetric criteria, including other cancer sites such as GYN.",10,[],5

1008.3036,physics,"This paper discusses the potential for enhancing the LCLS hard X-ray FEL capabilities. In the hard X-ray regime, a high longitudinal coherence will be the key to such performance upgrade. The method considered here to obtain high longitudinal coherence is based on a novel single-bunch self-seeding scheme exploiting a single crystal monochromator, which is extremely compact and can be straightforwardly installed in the LCLS baseline undulator. We present simulation results dealing with the LCLS hard X-ray FEL, and show that this method can produce fully-coherent X-ray pulses at 100 GW power level. With the radiation beam monochromatized down to the Fourier transform limit, a variety of very different techniques leading to further improvements of the LCLS performance become feasible. In particular, we describe an efficient way for obtaining full polarization control at the LCLS hard X-ray FEL. We also propose to exploit crystals in the Bragg reflection geometry as movable deflectors for the LCLS X-ray transport systems. The hard X-ray beam can be deflected of an angle of order of a radian without perturbations. The monochromatization of the output radiation constitutes the key for reaching such result. Finally, we describe a new optical pump - hard X-ray probe technique which will allow time-resolved studies at the LCLS baseline on the femtosecond time scale.

The electric field causes the water to break down, generating either a corona (at lower field strengths) or a pulsed arc (at higher field strengths). The discharge typically results in a complex combination of physical processes (e.g., cavitation and light emission) and chemical reactions (e.g., generation of free radicals and nonthermal plasmas). The combination of physical and chemical processes tends to destroy any organic molecules present, and accordingly electrohydraulic discharges are currently being investigated as a potentially inexpensive and environmentally friendly means for purifying drinking water and removing contaminants from wastewater.   Two types of electrode configurations have been the main focus of research to date: (i) a `one-phase' system with both electrodes immersed in water, or (ii) a `two-phase' system with one electrode in air and the other submerged in water. In this fluid dynamics video, we demonstrate the striking consequences of triggering an electrohydraulic discharge in a two-phase system comprised of water and a viscous, insulating oil. An air/water interface typically remains stationary until the discharge occurs; in contrast, the oil/water interface deforms into a conical shape (i.e., a Taylor cone) stretching from the water phase toward the oil-immersed electrode.

The construction starts with two extremely low loss metamaterials, with arbitrarily small microstructure, whose existence is ensured by the work of Bouchitt\'e and Bourel and Bouchitt\'e and Schweizer, one having at the given frequency a permittivity tensor with exactly one negative eigenvalue, and a positive permeability tensor, and the other having a positive permittivity tensor, and a permeability tensor having exactly one negative eigenvalue. To achieve the desired effective properties these materials are laminated together in a hierarchical multiple rank laminate structure, with widely separated length scales, and varying directions of lamination, but with the largest length scale still much shorter than the wavelengths and attenuation lengths in the macroscopic effective medium.",10,[],5

1009.1418,physics,"The finite element simulation of dynamic wetting phenomena, requiring the computation of flow in a domain confined by intersecting a liquid-fluid free surface and a liquid-solid interface, with the three-phase contact line moving across the solid, is considered. For this class of flows, different finite element method (FEM) implementations have been proposed in the literature and these are seen to produce apparently contradictory results. The purpose of this paper is to develop a robust framework for the FEM simulation of these flows and then, by performing numerical experiments, provide guidelines for future investigations. In the new framework, the boundary conditions on the liquid-solid interface are implemented in a methodologically similar way to those on the free surface so that the equations at the contact line, where the interfaces meet, are applied without any ad-hoc alterations. The new implementation removes the need for complex rotations of the momentum equations, usually required to apply boundary conditions normal and tangent to the solid surface. The developed code allows the convergence of the solution to be studied as the spatial resolution of the computational mesh is varied over many orders of magnitude. This makes it possible to provide practical recommendations on the spatial resolution required by a numerical scheme for a given set of non-dimensional similarity parameters. Furthermore, one can examine various implementations used in the literature and evaluate their performance. Finally, it is shown how the framework may be generalized to account for additional physical effects, such as gradients in surface tensions. A user-friendly step-by-step guide specifying the entire implementation and allowing the reader to easily reproduce all presented results is provided in the Appendix.",10,[],5

Knowing this transition polarizability is required in a number of high-precision experiments, such as microwave atomic clocks and searches for CP-violating permanent electric dipole moments. While the traditional polarizability arises in the second-order of interaction with the externally-applied electric field, the differential polarizability involves additional contribution from the hyperfine interaction of atomic electrons with nuclear moments.

1006.0814,physics,"This paper provides a new geospatial perspective on whether or not Zipf's law holds for all cities or for the largest cities in the United States using a massive dataset and its computing. A major problem around this issue is how to define cities or city boundaries. Most of the investigations of Zipf's law rely on the demarcations of cities imposed by census data, e.g., metropolitan areas and census-designated places. These demarcations or definitions (of cities) are criticized for being subjective or even arbitrary. Alternative solutions to defining cities are suggested, but they still rely on census data for their definitions. In this paper we demarcate urban agglomerations by clustering street nodes (including intersections and ends), forming what we call natural cities. Based on the demarcation, we found that Zipf's law holds remarkably well for all the natural cities (over 2-4 million in total) across the United States. There is little sensitivity for the holding with respect to the clustering resolution used for demarcating the natural cities. This is a big contrast to urban areas, as defined in the census data, which do not hold stable for Zipf's law.

They concluded from the absence of any structure that there is a second order melting transition in Na41 with no particular feature such as premelting. The observed difference with the latter results is attributed to the better accuracy of our method owing to its differential character.

1007.2743,physics,"The most promising way to increase the output power of an X-ray FEL (XFEL) is by tapering the magnetic field of the undulator. Also, significant increase in power is achievable by starting the FEL process from a monochromatic seed rather than from noise. This report proposes to make use of a cascade self-seeding scheme with wake monochromators in a tunable-gap baseline undulator at the European XFEL to create a source capable of delivering coherent radiation of unprecedented characteristics at hard X-ray wavelengths. Compared with SASE X-ray FEL parameters, the radiation from the new source has three truly unique aspects: complete longitudinal and transverse coherence, and a peak brightness three orders of magnitude higher than what is presently available at LCLS. Additionally, the new source will generate hard X-ray beam at extraordinary peak (TW) and average (kW) power level. The proposed source can thus revolutionize fields like single biomolecule imaging, inelastic scattering and nuclear resonant scattering. The self-seeding scheme with the wake monochromator is extremely compact, and takes almost no cost and time to be implemented. The upgrade proposed in this paper could take place during the commissioning stage of the European XFEL, opening a vast new range of applications from the very beginning of operations.

Here we formulated several predictions that follow from this hypothetical relationship and that can be empirically tested. Some of the experimental results that are already available suggest falsification of the first hypothesis. Thus, the suggested link between human consciousness and collapse of wave function does not seem viable.

The cross-correlation analysis shows no statistically significant global temperature lag behind the sunspots as well as behind aa-indices. The correlation between the temperature anomalies and the geomagnetic indices is about two times higher than the correlation between the temperature anomalies and the solar indices.

1007.2135,physics,"We make a detailed assessment of which form of the dipole operator to use in calculating high order harmonic generation within the framework of the strong field approximation, and look specifically at the role the form plays in the inclusion of multielectron effects perturbatively with regard to the contributions of the highest occupied molecular orbital. We focus on how these corrections affect the high-order harmonic spectra from aligned homonuclear and heteronuclear molecules, exemplified by equation and CO, respectively, which are isoelectronic. We find that the velocity form incorrectly finds zero static dipole moment in heteronuclear molecules. In contrast, the length form of the dipole operator leads to the physically expected non-vanishing expectation value for the dipole operator in this case. Furthermore, the so called ""overlap"" integrals, in which the dipole matrix element is computed using wavefunctions at different centers in the molecule, are prominent in the first-order multielectron corrections for the velocity form, and should not be ignored. Finally, inclusion of the multielectron corrections has very little effect on the spectrum. This suggests that relaxation, excitation and the dynamic motion of the core are important in order to describe multielectron effects in molecular high-order high harmonic generation.",10,[],5

This contribution tries to shed new light on problems that arise when complex systems are modeled. While the arguments can be transferred to many different systems, the related scientific challenges are illustrated for social, economic, and traffic systems.

It turns out compatibility between these two is possible only if there is a singular physical event at the time of the singularity or if the topology is not trivial. In both cases the singularity takes on the appearance of a time-like mirror. We are able to demonstrate a relationship between the broken time symmetry in electrodynamics characterized by retarded radiation and radiation reaction and the absolute conformal time relative to the time of the singularity, i.e. between the Electromagnetic and Cosmological arrows of time.

1011.4041,physics,"We model the subduction of buoyant ridges and plateaus to study their effect on slab dynamics. Oceanic ridges parallel to the trench have a stronger effect on the process of subduction because they simultaneously affect a longer trench segment. Large buoyant slab segments sink more slowly into the asthenosphere, and their subduction result in a diminution of the velocity of subduction of the plate. We observe a steeping of the slab below those buoyant anomalies, resulting in smaller radius of curvature of the slab, that augments the energy dissipated in folding the plate and further diminishes the velocity of subduction. When the 3D geometry of a buoyant plateau is modelled, the dip of the slab above the plateau decreases, as a result of the larger velocity of subduction of the dense ""normal"" oceanic plate on both sides of the plateau. Such a perturbation of the dip of the slab maintains long time after the plateau has been entirely incorporated into the subduction zone. We compare experiments with the present-day subduction zone below South America. Experiments suggest that a modest ridge perpendicular to the trench such as the present-day Juan Fernandez ridge is not buoyant enough to modify the slab geometry.

1006.4650,physics,"Attempts to merge Einsteinian gravity with Newtonian run into inconsistencies because in Newton's gravity time is absolute and the speed of gravity is infinite. Such an assumption was in a focus of attention of scientists in 19th century interested in finding out if the speed of gravity is infinite. By analogy with electrodynamics, some retarded potentials replacing Newtonian were utilized. By using one of such potentials Gerber correctly calculated the perihelion shift for Mercury in 1902. Subsequent attempts at calculation of bending of light using Gerber-style calculations were not successful. Recently Gin\'e (Chaos, Solitons and Fractals 42, 1893 (2009)) reobtained both the perihelion shift and the bending of light using retarded potential. His equations however are not those obtained by Einstein and his results coincide with those by Einstein only at the level of leading order terms of infinite series expansions. The obtained differential equations of motion are of delay-type. When applied to two-body dynamics, such equations lead to orbital quantization. In this work the Einsteinian approach is used to reproduce this quantization. Numerous arguments justifying the superiority of Einsteinian approach, including uses of the Bertrand spacetimes for description of motion of stars around galactic centers are provided.

1001.3813,q-bio,"The ability to locate and annotate mitochondrial genes is an important practical issue, given the rapidly increasing number of mitogenomes appearing in the public databases. Unfortunately, tRNA genes in Metazoan mitochondria have proved to be problematic because they often vary in number (genes missing or duplicated) and also in the secondary structure of the transcribed tRNAs (T or D arms missing). I have performed a series of comparative analyses of the tRNA genes of a broad range of Metazoan mitogenomes in order to address this issue. I conclude that no single computer program is necessarily capable of finding all of the tRNA genes in any given mitogenome, and that use of both the ARWEN and DOGMA programs is sometimes necessary because they produce complementary false negatives. There are apparently a very large number of erroneous annotations in the databased mitogenome sequences, including missed genes, wrongly annotated locations, false complements, and inconsistent criteria for assigning the 5' and 3' boundaries; and I have listed many of these. The extent of overlap between genes is often greatly exaggerated due to inconsistent annotations, although notable overlaps involving tRNAs are apparently real. Finally, three novel hypotheses were examined and found to have support from the comparative analyses: (1) some organisms have mitogenomic locations that simultaneously code for multiple tRNAs; (2) some organisms have mitogenomic locations that simultaneously code for tRNAs and proteins (but not rRNAs); and (3) one group of nematodes has several genes that code for tRNAs lacking both the D and T arms.",10,[],10

We examine different modes of transcription factor binding to complex promoters (cooperative, independent, simultaneous) and how each of these affects the level of variability in transcription product from cell-to-cell. We propose that direct comparison between in vivo single-cell experiments and theoretical predictions for the moments of the probability distribution of mRNA number per cell can discriminate between different kinetic models of gene regulation.",10,[],10
1004.4528,q-bio,"As early indicated by Charles Darwin, languages behave and change very much like living species. They display high diversity, differentiate in space and time, emerge and disappear. A large body of literature has explored the role of information exchanges and communicative constraints in groups of agents under selective scenarios. These models have been very helpful in providing a rationale on how complex forms of communication emerge under evolutionary pressures. However, other patterns of large-scale organization can be described using mathematical methods ignoring communicative traits. These approaches consider shorter time scales and have been developed by exploiting both theoretical ecology and statistical physics methods. The models are reviewed here and include extinction, invasion, origination, spatial organization, coexistence and diversity as key concepts and are very simple in their defining rules. Such simplicity is used in order to catch the most fundamental laws of organization and those universal ingredients responsible for qualitative traits. The similarities between observed and predicted patterns indicate that an ecological theory of language is emerging, supporting (on a quantitative basis) its ecological nature, although key differences are also present. Here we critically review some recent advances lying and outline their implications and limitations as well as open problems for future research.",10,[],10

1004.5088,q-bio,"Term enrichment analysis facilitates biological interpretation by assigning to experimentally/computationally obtained data annotation associated with terms from controlled vocabularies. This process usually involves obtaining statistical significance for each vocabulary term and using the most significant terms to describe a given set of biological entities, often associated with weights. Many existing enrichment methods require selections of (arbitrary number of) the most significant entities and/or do not account for weights of entities. Others either mandate extensive simulations to obtain statistics or assume normal weight distribution. In addition, most methods have difficulty assigning correct statistical significance to terms with few entities. Implementing the well-known Lugananni-Rice formula, we have developed a novel approach, called SaddleSum, that is free from all the aforementioned constraints and evaluated it against several existing methods. With entity weights properly taken into account, SaddleSum is internally consistent and stable with respect to the choice of number of most significant entities selected. Making few assumptions on the input data, the proposed method is universal and can thus be applied to areas beyond analysis of microarrays. Employing asymptotic approximation, SaddleSum provides a term-size dependent score distribution function that gives rise to accurate statistical significance even for terms with few entities. As a consequence, SaddleSum enables researchers to place confidence in its significance assignments to small terms that are often biologically most specific.",10,[],10
1008.1887,q-bio,"Stoichiometric constraints play a role in the dynamics of natural populations, but are not explicitly considered in most mathematical models. Recent theoretical works suggest that these constraints can have a significant impact and should not be neglected. However, it is not yet resolved how stoichiometry should be integrated in population dynamical models, as different modeling approaches are found to yield qualitatively different results. Here we investigate a unifying framework that reveals the differences and commonalities between previously proposed models for producer-grazer systems. Our analysis reveals that stoichiometric constraints affect the dynamics mainly by increasing the intraspecific competition between producers and by introducing a variable biomass conversion efficiency. The intraspecific competition has a strongly stabilizing effect on the system, whereas the variable conversion efficiency resulting from a variable food quality is the main determinant for the nature of the instability once destabilization occurs. Only if the food quality is high an oscillatory instability, as in the classical paradox of enrichment, can occur. While the generalized model reveals that the generic insights remain valid in a large class of models, we show that other details such as the specific sequence of bifurcations encountered in enrichment scenarios can depend sensitively on assumptions made in modeling stoichiometric constraints.",10,[],10
1010.0904,q-bio,"Cellular responses in the single cells are known to be highly heterogeneous and individualistic due to the strong influence by extrinsic and intrinsic noise. Here, we are concerned about how to model the extrinsic noise-induced heterogeneous response in the single cells under the constraints of experimentally obtained population-averaged response, but without much detailed kinetic information. We propose a novel statistical ensemble scheme where extrinsic noise is regarded as fluctuations in the values of kinetic parameters and such fluctuations are modeled by randomly sampling the kinetic rate constants from a uniform distribution. We consider a large number of signaling system replicates, each of which has the same network topology, but a uniquely different set of kinetic rate constants. A protein dynamic response from each replicate should represent the dynamics in a single cell and the statistical ensemble average should be regarded as a population-level response averaged over a population of the cells. We devise an optimization algorithm to find the correct uniform distribution of the network parameters, which produces the correct statistical distribution of the response whose ensemble average and distribution agree well with the population-level experimental data and the experimentally observed heterogeneity. We apply this statistical ensemble analysis to a NF-letterB signaling system and (1) predict the distributions of the heterogeneous NF-letterB (either oscillatory or non-oscillatory) dynamic patterns and of the dynamic features (e.g., period), (2) predict that both the distribution and the statistical ensemble average of the NF-letterB dynamic response depends sensitively on the dosage of stimulant, and lastly (3) demonstrate the sigmoidally shaped dose-response from the statistical ensemble average and the individual replicates.",10,[],10

1007.0876,q-bio,"Studies into the statistical properties of biological networks have led to important biological insights, such as the presence of hubs and hierarchical modularity. There is also a growing interest in studying the statistical properties of networks in the context of cancer genomics. However, relatively little is known as to what network features differ between the cancer and normal cell physiologies, or between different cancer cell phenotypes. Based on the observation that frequent genomic alterations underlie a more aggressive cancer phenotype, we asked if such an effect could be detectable as an increase in the randomness of local gene expression patterns. Using a breast cancer gene expression data set and a model network of protein interactions we derive constrained weighted networks defined by a stochastic information flux matrix reflecting expression correlations between interacting proteins. Based on this stochastic matrix we propose and compute an entropy measure that quantifies the degree of randomness in the local pattern of information flux around single genes. By comparing the local entropies in the non-metastatic versus metastatic breast cancer networks, we here show that breast cancers that metastasize are characterised by a small yet significant increase in the degree of randomness of local expression patterns. We validate this result in three additional breast cancer expression data sets and demonstrate that local entropy better characterises the metastatic phenotype than other non-entropy based measures. We show that increases in entropy can be used to identify genes and signalling pathways implicated in breast cancer metastasis. Further exploration of such integrated cancer expression and protein interaction networks will therefore be a fruitful endeavour.",10,[],10
1012.5916,q-bio,"We study the combined influence of amino acid composition and chain length on the thermal stability of protein structures. A new parameterization of the internal free energy is considered, as the sum of hydrophobic effect, hydrogen-bond and de-hydration energy terms. We divided a non-redundant selection of protein structures from the Protein Data Bank into three groups: i) rich in order-promoting residues (OPR proteins); ii) rich in disorder-promoting residues (DPR proteins); iii) belonging to a twilight zone (TZ proteins). We observe a partition of PDB in several groups with different internal free energies, amino acid compositions and protein lengths. Internal free energy of 96% of the proteins analyzed ranges from -2 to -6.5 kJ/mol/res. We found many DPR and OPR proteins with the same relative thermal stability. Only OPR proteins with internal energy between -4 and -6.5 kJ/mol/res are observed to have chains longer than 200 residues, with a high de-hydration energy compensated by the hydrophobic effect. DPR and TZ proteins are shorter than 200 residues and they have an internal energy above -4 kJ/mol/res, with a few exceptions among TZ proteins. Hydrogen-bonds play an important role in the stabilization of these DPR folds, often higher than contact energy. The new parameterization of internal free energy let emerge a geography of thermal stabilities of PDB structures. Amino acid composition per se is not sufficient to determine the stability of protein folds, since. DPR and TZ proteins generally have a relatively high internal free energy, and they are stabilized by hydrogen-bonds. Long DPR proteins are not observed in the PDB, because their low hydrophobicity cannot compensate the high de-hydration energy necessary to accommodate residues within a highly packed globular fold.",10,[],10

1010.0888,q-bio,"NF-letterB is a pleiotropic protein whose nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking is tightly regulated by multiple negative feedback loops embedded in the NF-letterB signaling network and contributes to diverse gene expression profiles important in immune cell differentiation, cell apoptosis, and innate immunity. The intracellular signaling processes and their control mechanisms, however, are susceptible to both extrinsic and intrinsic noise. In this article, we present numerical evidence for a universal dynamic behavior of NF-letterB, namely oscillatory nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, due to the fundamentally stochastic nature of the NF-letterB signaling network. We simulated the effect of extrinsic noise with a deterministic ODE model, using a statistical ensemble approach, generating many copies of the signaling network with different kinetic rates sampled from a biologically feasible parameter space. We modeled the effect of intrinsic noise by simulating the same networks stochastically using the Gillespie algorithm. The results demonstrate that extrinsic noise diversifies the shuttling patterns of NF-letterB response, whereas intrinsic noise induces oscillatory behavior in many of the otherwise non-oscillatory patterns. We identify two key model parameters which significantly affect the NF-letterB dynamic response and deduce a two-dimensional phase-diagram of the NF-letterB response as a function of these parameters. We conclude that if single-cell experiments are performed, a rich variety of NF-letterB response will be observed, even if population-level experiments, which average response over large numbers of cells, do not evidence oscillatory behavior.",10,[],10

A vast number of protein (if not most) exert their function through some extent of motion. Despite recent advances in higly performant methods, it is very difficult to obtain direct information on conformational changes of molecules. However, several systems exist that can shed some light on the variability of conformations of a single peptide chain; among them, NMR methods provide collections of a number of static 'shots' of a moving protein. Starting from this data, and assuming that if a protein exists in more than 1 conformation it must be able to transit between the different states, we have elaborated a system that makes ample use of the computational power of 3D computer graphics technology. Considering information of all (heavy) atoms, we use animation and game engine of Blender to obtain transition states. The model we chose to elaborate our system is Calmodulin, a protein favorite among structural and dynamic studies due to its (relative) simplicity of structure and small dimension. Using Calmodulin we show a procedure that enables the building of a 'navigation map' of NMR models, that can help in the identification of movements. In the process, a number of intermediate conformations is generated, all of which respond to strict bio-physical and bio-chemical criteria.

1008.3358,q-bio,"Existing sequence alignment algorithms use heuristic scoring schemes which cannot be used as objective distance metrics. Therefore one relies on measures like the p- or log-det distances, or makes explicit, and often simplistic, assumptions about sequence evolution. Information theory provides an alternative, in the form of mutual information (MI) which is, in principle, an objective and model independent similarity measure. MI can be estimated by concatenating and zipping sequences, yielding thereby the ""normalized compression distance"". So far this has produced promising results, but with uncontrolled errors. We describe a simple approach to get robust estimates of MI from global pairwise alignments. Using standard alignment algorithms, this gives for animal mitochondrial DNA estimates that are strikingly close to estimates obtained from the alignment free methods mentioned above. Our main result uses algorithmic (Kolmogorov) information theory, but we show that similar results can also be obtained from Shannon theory. Due to the fact that it is not additive, normalized compression distance is not an optimal metric for phylogenetics, but we propose a simple modification that overcomes the issue of additivity. We test several versions of our MI based distance measures on a large number of randomly chosen quartets and demonstrate that they all perform better than traditional measures like the Kimura or log-det (resp. paralinear) distances. Even a simplified version based on single letter Shannon entropies, which can be easily incorporated in existing software packages, gave superior results throughout the entire animal kingdom. But we see the main virtue of our approach in a more general way. For example, it can also help to judge the relative merits of different alignment algorithms, by estimating the significance of specific alignments.",10,[],10

In particular, the role of biological rhythms do not seem to have any counterpart in mathematical formalization of physical clocks, which are based on frequencies along the usual (possibly thermodynamical, thus oriented) time. We then suggest a functional representation of biological time by a 2-dimensional manifold as a mathematical frame for accommodating autonomous biological rhythms. The ""visual"" representation of rhythms so obtained, in particular heart beatings, will provide, by a few examples, hints towards possible applications of our approach to the understanding of interspecific differences or intraspecific pathologies.

1007.5471,q-bio,"Over the last years, increasing evidence has fuelled the hypothesis that Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a condition of altered brain functional connectivity. The great majority of these empirical studies rely on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) which has a relatively poor temporal resolution. Only a handful of studies have examined networks emerging from dynamic coherence at the millisecond resolution and there are no investigations of coherence at the lowest frequencies in the power spectrum - which has recently been shown to reflect long-range cortico-cortical connections. Here we used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess dynamic brain connectivity in ASD focusing in the low-frequency (delta) range. We found that connectivity patterns were distinct in ASD and control populations and reflected a double dissociation: ASD subjects lacked long-range connections, with a most prominent deficit in fronto-occipital connections. Conversely, individuals with ASD showed increased short-range connections in lateral-frontal electrodes. This effect between categories showed a consistent parametric dependency: as ASD severity increased, short-range coherence was more pronounced and long-range coherence decreased. Theoretical arguments have been proposed arguing that distinct patterns of connectivity may result in networks with different efficiency in transmission of information. We show that the networks in ASD subjects have less Clustering coefficient, greater Characteristic Path Length than controls -indicating that the topology of the network departs from small-world behaviour- and greater modularity. Together these results show that delta-band coherence reveal qualitative and quantitative aspects associated with ASD pathology.",10,[],10

The few theories to this question provide functional answers, such as better networks for visuomotor control. However, these theories contradict the data, as discussed here. Instead we propose that a 90-deg left-turn around the body-axis evolved in a common ancestor of all vertebrates. Compensatory migrations of the tissues during development restore body symmetry. Eyes, nostrils and forebrain compensate in the direction of the turn, whereas more caudal structures migrate in the opposite direction. As a result of these opposite migrations the forebrain becomes crossed and inverted with respect to the rest of the nervous system. We show that these compensatory migratory movements can indeed be observed in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) and the chick (Gallus gallus). With a model we show how the axial twist hypothesis predicts that an optic chiasm should develop on the ventral side of the brain, whereas the olfactory tract should be uncrossed. In addition, the hypothesis explains the decussation of the trochlear nerve, why olfaction is non-crossed, why the cerebellar hemispheres represent the ipsilateral bodyside, why in sharks the forebrain halves each represent the ipsilateral eye, why the heart and other inner organs are asymmetric in the body. Due to the poor fossil record, the possible evolutionary scenarios remain speculative. Molecular evidence does support the hypothesis.

One of these scenarios utilizes the power of punishment to suppress free riders, but only if players interact in a structured population where cooperators are likely to be surrounded by other cooperators. Here we show that cooperation via punishment can evolve even in well-mixed populations that play the ""public goods"" game, if the synergy effect of cooperation is high enough. As the synergy is increased, populations transition from defection to cooperation in a manner reminiscent of a phase transition. If punishment is turned off, the critical synergy is significantly higher, illustrating that (as shown before) punishment aids in establishing cooperation.

Guaranteeing both accuracy and efficiency seems to be a computational goal quite far to be achieved, since accuracy is strictly related to exploiting the inherent redundancy of information present in a large cluster. We propose a fast method for the problem that combines two ideas: a novel algorithm of proved small time complexity for computing spliced alignments of a transcript against a genome, and an efficient algorithm that exploits the inherent redundancy of information in a cluster of transcripts to select, among all possible factorizations of EST sequences, those allowing to infer splice site junctions that are highly confirmed by the input data.

1004.0336,q-bio,"MicroRNAs are endogenous non-coding RNAs which negatively regulate the expression of protein-coding genes in plants and animals. They are known to play an important role in several biological processes and, together with transcription factors, form a complex and highly interconnected regulatory network. Looking at the structure of this network it is possible to recognize a few overrepresented motifs which are expected to perform important elementary regulatory functions. Among them a special role is played by the microRNA-mediated feedforward loop in which a master transcription factor regulates a microRNA and, together with it, a set of target genes. In this paper we show analytically and through simulations that the incoherent version of this motif can couple the fine-tuning of a target protein level with an efficient noise control, thus conferring precision and stability to the overall gene expression program, especially in the presence of fluctuations in upstream regulators. Among the other results, a nontrivial prediction of our model is that the optimal attenuation of fluctuations coincides with a modest repression of the target expression. This feature is coherent with the expected fine-tuning function and in agreement with experimental observations of the actual impact of a wide class of microRNAs on the protein output of their targets.

We consider an enzyme solution as an ensemble of individual molecules with different values of the activation barrier energy described by the distribution. From the solvent viscosity effect on the preexponent we derive the integral equation for the distribution and find its approximate solution. Our approach enables us to attain a twofold purpose. On the one hand it yields a simple interpretation of the solvent viscosity dependence for enzymatic/protein reactions that requires neither a modification of the Kramers' theory nor that of the Stokes law. On the other hand our approach enables us to deduce the form of the distribution over activation barrier energies.

During fly development in early Drosophila embryos, the Bicoid (Bcd) morphogen gradient is established within the first hour after fertilization. Bcd acts as a transcription factor, initiating the expression of a cascade of genes that determine the segmentation pattern of the embryo, which serves as a blueprint for the future adult organism. A robust understanding of the mechanisms that govern this segmentation cascade is still lacking, and a new generation of quantitative measurements of the spatio-temporal concentration dynamics of the individual players of this cascade are necessary for further progress. Here we describe a series of methods that are meant to represent a start of such a quantification using Bcd as an example. We describe the generation of a transgenic fly line expressing a Bcd-eGFP fusion protein, and we use this line to carefully analyze the Bcd concentration dynamics and to measure absolute Bcd expression levels in living fly embryos using two-photon microscopy. These experiments have proven to be a fruitful tool generating new insights into the mechanisms that lead to the establishment and the readout of the Bcd gradient.

Ligand binding activates integrins by stabilizing an integrin conformation with separated cytoplasmic tails, thus enabling the binding of proteins that mediate cytoplasmic signaling. Experiments demonstrate a high sensitivity of integrin signaling to ligand density and this has been accounted mainly to avidity effects. Based on experimental data we have developed a quantitative Monte Carlo model for integrin signal initiation. We show that within the physiological ligand density range avidity effects cannot explain the sensitivity of cellular signaling to small changes in ligand density. Src kinases are among the first proteins to be activated, possibly by trans auto-phosphorylation. We calculate the extent of integrin and ligand clustering as well as the speed and extent of Src kinase activation by trans auto-phosphorylation or direct binding at different experimentally monitored ligand densities. We find that the experimentally observed ligand density dependency can be reproduced if Src kinases are activated by trans auto-phosphorylation or some other mechanism limits integrin-dependent Src kinase activation. We propose that Src kinase and thus cell activation by trans auto-phosphorylation may provide a mechanism to enable ligand-density dependent responses at physiological ligand densities. The capacity to detect small differences in ligand density at a ligand density that is large enough to permit cell adhesion is likely to be important for haptotaxis.",10,[],10
1009.5667,q-bio,"In synthetic biology, gene regulatory circuits are often constructed by combining smaller circuit components. Connections between components are achieved by transcription factors acting on promoters. If the individual components behave as true modules and certain module interface conditions are satisfied, the function of the composite circuits can in principle be predicted. In this paper, we investigate one of the interface conditions: fan-out. We quantify the fan-out, a concept widely used in electric engineering, to indicate the maximum number of the downstream inputs that an upstream output transcription factor can regulate. We show that the fan-out is closely related to retroactivity studied by Del Vecchio, et al. We propose an efficient operational method for measuring the fan-out that can be applied to various types of module interfaces. We also show that the fan-out can be enhanced by self-inhibitory regulation on the output. We discuss the potential role of the inhibitory regulations found in gene regulatory networks and protein signal pathways. The proposed estimation method for fanout not only provides an experimentally efficient way for quantifying the level of modularity in gene regulatory circuits but also helps characterize and design module interfaces, enabling the modular construction of gene circuits.",10,[],10
1012.5063,q-bio,"In this work, we modify the superparamagnetic clustering algorithm (SPC) by adding an extra weight to the interaction formula that considers which genes are regulated by the same transcription factor. With this modified algorithm that we call SPCTF, we analyze Spellman et al. microarray data for cell cycle genes in yeast, and find clusters with a higher number of elements compared with those obtained with the SPC algorithm. Some of the incorporated genes by using SPCFT were not detected at first by Spellman et al. but were later identified by other studies, whereas several genes still remain unclassified. The clusters composed by unidentified genes were analyzed with MUSA, the motif finding using an unsupervised approach algorithm, and this allow us to select the clusters whose elements contain cell cycle transcription factor binding sites as clusters worth of further experimental studies because they would probably lead to new cell cycle genes. Finally, our idea of introducing available information about transcription factors to optimize the gene classification could be implemented for other distance-based clustering algorithms",10,[],10

1002.4599,q-bio,"In many biological processes heterogeneity within cell populations is an important issue. In this work we consider populations where the behavior of every single cell can be described by a system of ordinary differential equations. Heterogeneity among individual cells is accounted for by differences in parameter values and initial conditions. Hereby, parameter values and initial conditions are subject to a distribution function which is part of the model specification. Based on the single cell model and the considered parameter distribution, a partial differential equation model describing the distribution of cells in the state and in the output space is derived.   For the estimation of the parameter distribution within the model, we consider experimental data as obtained from flow cytometric analysis. From these noise-corrupted data a density-based statistical data model is derived. Using this data model the parameter distribution within the cell population is computed using convex optimization techniques.   To evaluate the proposed method, a model for the caspase activation cascade is considered. It is shown that for known noise properties the unknown parameter distributions in this model are well estimated by the proposed method.",10,[],10
1003.2366,q-bio,"The aim of this paper is to discuss the role of robustness and diversity in population dynamics in particular to some properties of the multi-step from healthy tissue to fully malignant tumours. Recent evidence shows that diversity within the cell population of a neoplasm, a pre-tumoural lession that can develop into a fully malignant tumour, is the best predictor for its evolving into a tumour. By studying the dynamics of a population described by a multi-type, population-size limited branching process in terms of the evolutionary formalism, we show some general principles regarding the probability of a resident population to being invaded by a mutant population in terms of the number of types present in the population and their resilience. We show that, although diversity in the mutant population poses a barrier for the emergence of the initial (benign) lession, under appropiate conditions, namely, the phenotypes in the mutant population being more resilient than those of the resident population, a more variable noeplastic population is more likely to be invaded by a more malignant one. Analysis of a model of gene regulatory networks suggest possible mechanisms giving rise to mutants with increased phenotypic diversity and robustness.

1012.5011,q-bio,"Detection of false-positive motifs is one of the main causes of low performance in motif finding methods. It is generally assumed that false-positives are mostly due to algorithmic weakness of motif-finders. Here, however, we derive the theoretical dependence of false positives on dataset size and find that false positives can arise as a result of large dataset size, irrespective of the algorithm used. Interestingly, the false-positive strength depends more on the number of sequences in the dataset than it does on the sequence length. As expected, false-positives can be reduced by decreasing the sequence length or by adding more sequences to the dataset. The dependence on number of sequences, however, diminishes and reaches a plateau after which adding more sequences to the dataset does not reduce the false-positive rate significantly. Based on the theoretical results presented here, we provide a number of intuitive rules of thumb that may be used to enhance motif-finding results in practice.",10,[],10

Here, we applied Network Environ Analysis to 50 empirically-based trophic ecosystem models to test the hypothesis that indirect flows dominate direct flows in ecosystem networks. Further, we used Monte Carlo based perturbations to investigate the robustness of these results to potential error in the underlying data. To explain our findings, we further investigated the importance of the microbial food web in recycling energy-matter using components of the Finn Cycling Index and analysis of Environ Centrality. We found that indirect flows dominate direct flows in 37/50 (74.0%) models. This increases to 31/35 (88.5%) models when we consider only models that have cycling structure and a representation of the microbial food web. The uncertainty analysis reveals that there is less error in the I/D values than the equation 5% error introduced into the models, suggesting the results are robust to uncertainty. Our results show that the microbial food web mediates a substantial percentage of cycling in some systems (median = 30.2%), but its role is highly variable in these models, in agreement with the literature.

Calcium entrance in the cell inhibits the enzyme. The increment of cyclic AMP activates kinaseA and their protein phosphorylating activity, allowing a long term memory pathway. Hence, consolidating neuronal circuits, related to emotional learning and memory affirmation.The activatory effect relates to an enzyme-noradrenaline complex which may participate on the physiology of the fight or flight response, by prolonged exposure. However, the persistence of an unstable enzyme complex turns the enzyme inactive. Effect concordant, with the observation that prolonged exposure to adrenaline, participate in the etiology of stress triggered pathologies. At the cell physiological level AC responsiveness to hormones could be modulated by the concentration of Chelating Metabolites. These ones produce the release of free ATP4-, a negative modulator of AC and the Mg2 activated insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (IRTK). Thus, allowing an integration of the hormonal response of both enzymes by ionic controls. This effect could supersede the metabolic feedback control by energy-charge.

1002.1054,q-bio,"Many biochemical processes can successfully be described by dynamical systems allowing some form of switching when, depending on their initial conditions, solutions of the dynamical system end up in different regions of state space (associated with different biochemical functions). Switching is often realized by a bistable system (i.e. a dynamical system allowing two stable steady state solutions) and, in the majority of cases, bistability is established numerically. In our point of view this approach is too restrictive, as, one the one hand, due to predominant parameter uncertainty numerical methods are generally difficult to apply to realistic models originating in Systems Biology. And on the other hand switching already arises with the occurrence of a saddle type steady state (characterized by a Jacobian where exactly one Eigenvalue is positive and the remaining eigenvalues have negative real part). Consequently we derive conditions based on linear inequalities that allow the analytic computation of states and parameters where the Jacobian derived from a mass action network has a defective zero eigenvalue so that -- under certain genericity conditions -- a saddle-node bifurcation occurs. Our conditions are applicable to general mass action networks involving at least one conservation relation, however, they are only sufficient (as infeasibility of linear inequalities does not exclude defective zero eigenvalues).",10,[],10

We also show that the distribution of these risk variants in African populations is consistent with the pattern of African ancestry ESKD risk previously attributed to the MYH9 gene.

1004.4138,q-bio,"We synthesise traditional unstructured food webs, allometric body size scaling, trait-based modelling, and physiologically structured modelling to provide a novel and ecologically relevant tool for size-structured food webs. The framework allows food web models to include ontogenetic growth and life-history omnivory at the individual level by resolving the population structure of each species as a size-spectrum. Each species is characterised by the trait 'size at maturation', and all model parameters are made species independent through scaling with individual body size and size at maturation. Parameter values are determined from cross-species analysis of fish communities as life-history omnivory is widespread in aquatic systems, but may be reparameterised for other systems. An ensemble of food webs is generated and the resulting communities are analysed at four levels of organisation: community level, species level, trait level, and individual level. The model may be solved analytically by assuming that the community spectrum follows a power law. The analytical solution provides a baseline expectation of the results of complex food web simulations, and agrees well with the predictions of the full model on 1) biomass distribution as a function of individual size, 2) biomass distribution as a function of size at maturation, and 3) relation between predator-prey mass ratio of preferred and eaten food.

1005.3349,q-bio,"A variety of genome transformations can occur as a microbial population adapts to a large environmental change. In particular, genomic surveys indicate that, following the transition to an obligate, host-dependent symbiont, the density of transposons first rises, then subsequently declines over evolutionary time. Here, we show that these observations can be accounted for by a class of generic stochastic models for the evolution of genomes in the presence of continuous selection and gene duplication. The models use a fitness function that allows for partial contributions from multiple gene copies, is an increasing but bounded function of copy number, and is optimal for one fully adapted gene copy. We use Monte Carlo simulation to show that the dynamics result in an initial rise in gene copy number followed by a subsequent fall due to adaptation to the new environmental parameters. These results are robust for reasonable gene duplication and mutation parameters when adapting to a novel target sequence. Our model provides a generic explanation for the dynamics of microbial transposon density following a large environmental changes such as host restriction.",10,[],10

Unlike in the case of measuring a static quantity, response to an oscillatory driving can exhibit a resonant frequency which maximizes information transmission.

As part of FANTOM4, we used microarrays to identify 23 microRNAs that are regulated by PMA.

We compare with experiments on the adhesion of Jurkat T cells to bilayers containing the relevant natural killer cell receptor, with adhesion mediated by the drug alefacept. We show that a model in which all target cell epitopes are mobile and available is inconsistent with the data, suggesting that more complex mechanisms are at work. We hypothesize that the immobile epitope fraction may change with cell adhesion, and we find that such a model is more consistent with the data.

While long and short-range interactions are determined by the positions of amino acids in primary chain, the contact networks are constructed based on the 3D spatial distances of amino acids. We have further divided these networks into sub-networks of hydrophobic, hydrophilic and charged residues. Our analysis reveals that a significantly higher percentage of assortative sub-clusters of long-range hydrophobic networks helps a protein in communicating the necessary information for protein folding in one hand; on the other hand the higher values of clustering coefficients of hydrophobic sub-clusters play a major role in slowing down the process so that necessary local and global stability can be achieved through intra connectivities of the amino acid residues. Further, higher degrees of hydrophobic long-range interactions suggest their greater role in protein folding and stability. The small-range all amino acids networks have signature of hierarchy. The present analysis with other evidences suggest that in a protein's 3D conformational space, the growth of connectivity is not evolved either through preferential attachment or through random connections; rather, it follows a specific structural necessity based guiding principle - where some of the interactions are primary while the others, generated as a consequence of these primary interactions are secondary.",10,[],10

We hypothesize that immunotherapy mainly acts on the T cell level and that the decisive process can be regarded as a dynamical phenomenon. The model consists of nonlinear differential equations which describe the proliferation and mutual suppression of different T cell subsets. The old version of the model was based upon the Th1-Th2 paradigm and is successful in describing the ""Th1-Th2 switch"" which was considered the decisive event during specific immunotherapy. In recent years, however, the Th1-Th2 paradigm has been questioned and therefore, we have investigated a modified model in order to account for the influence of a regulatory T cell type. We examined the extended model by means of numerical simulations and analytical methods. As the modified model is more complex, we had to develop new methods to portray its characteristics. The concept of stable manifolds of fixed points of a stroboscobic map turned out to be especially important. We found that when including regulatory T cells, our model can describe the events in allergen-specific immunotherapy more accurately.

We have then generated three healthy cell models by changing these sensitive parameters while preserving bistability i.e., healthy functioning. For each healthy cell, we varied the proapoptotic production rates, which were found to be among the most sensitive parameters, to yield cells that have malfunctioning apoptosis.

The simulations of the present model suggest that proteasome inhibitor treatment is the most effective treatment though it may have severe side effects. For this treatment, we observed that the amount of proteasome inhibitor needed for caspase-3 activation may be different for cells in individuals with a different proapoptotic protein deficiency.

Each nucleosome, the fundamental unit of chromatin, has 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer. In order to describe how chromatin fiber formation affects nucleosome positioning and energetics, we have developed a thermodynamic model of finite-size particles with effective nearest-neighbor interactions and arbitrary DNA-binding energies. We show that both one- and two-body interactions can be accurately extracted from one-particle density profiles based on high-throughput maps of in vitro or in vivo nucleosome positions. Although a simpler approach that neglects two-body interactions (even if they are in fact present in the system) can be used to predict sequence determinants of nucleosome positions, the full theory is required to disentangle one- and two-body effects. Finally, we construct a minimal model in which nucleosomes are positioned by steric exclusion and two-body interactions rather than intrinsic histone-DNA sequence preferences. The model accurately reproduces nucleosome occupancy patterns observed over transcribed regions in living cells.",10,[],10
1010.1239,q-bio,"Bone remodeling is regulated by pathways controlling the interplay of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In this work, we apply the method of generalized modelling to systematically analyse a large class of models of bone remodeling. Our analysis shows that osteoblast precursors can play an important role in the regulation of bone remodeling. Further, we find that the parameter regime most likely realized in nature lies very close to bifurcation lines, marking qualitative changes in the dynamics. Although proximity to a bifurcation facilitates adaptive responses to changing external conditions, it entails the danger of losing dynamical stability. Some evidence implicates such dynamical transitions as a potential mechanism leading to forms of Paget's disease.",10,[],10
1004.2821,q-bio,"The cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus uses both a protein phosphorylation cycle and a transcription-translation cycle to generate circadian rhythms that are highly robust against biochemical noise. We use stochastic simulations to analyze how these cycles interact to generate stable rhythms in growing, dividing cells. We find that a protein phosphorylation cycle by itself is robust when protein turnover is low. For high decay or dilution rates (and co mpensating synthesis rate), however, the phosphorylation-based oscillator loses its integrity. Circadian rhythms thus cannot be generated with a phosphorylation cycle alone when the growth rate, and consequently the rate of protein dilution, is high enough; in practice, a purely post-translational clock ceases to function well when the cell doubling time drops below the 24 hour clock period. At higher growth rates, a transcription-translation cycle becomes essential for generating robust circadian rhythms. Interestingly, while a transcription-translation cycle is necessary to sustain a phosphorylation cycle at high growth rates, a phosphorylation cycle can dramatically enhance the robustness of a transcription-translation cycle at lower protein decay or dilution rates. Our analysis thus predicts that both cycles are required to generate robust circadian rhythms over the full range of growth conditions.",10,[],10
1004.2009,q-bio,"We develop a spatially explicit biophysical model of the hippocampal CA3-CA1 presynaptic bouton to study local calcium dynamics leading to vesicle fusion. A kinetic model with two calcium sensors is formulated specifically for the CA3-CA1 synapse. The model includes a sensor for fast synchronous release that lasts a few tens of milliseconds and a sensor for slow asynchronous release that lasts a few hundred milliseconds. We show that a variety of extant data on CA3-CA1 synapse can be accounted for consistently only when a refractory period of the order of few milliseconds between releases is introduced. Including a second sensor for asynchronous release that has a slow unbinding site and therefore an embedded long memory, is shown to play a role in short-term plasticity by facilitating release. For synchronous release mediated by Synaptotagmin II a third time scale is revealed in addition to the fast and slow release. This third time scale corresponds to ""stimulus-correlated super-fast"" neurotransmitter release. Our detailed spatial simulation indicates that all three-time scales of neurotransmitter release are an emergent property of the calcium sensor and independent of synaptic ultrastructure. Furthermore, it allows us to identify features of synaptic transmission that are universal and those that are modulated by structure.",10,[],10
1001.5309,q-bio,"In the human genomes, recombination frequency between homologous chromosomes during meiosis is highly correlated with their physical length while it differs significantly when their coding density is considered. Furthermore, it has been observed that the recombination events are distributed unevenly along the chromosomes. We have found that many of such recombination properties can be predicted by computer simulations of population evolution based on the Monte Carlo methods. For example, these simulations have shown that the probability of acceptance of the recombination events by selection is higher at the ends of chromosomes and lower in their middle parts. The regions of high coding density are more prone to enter the strategy of haplotype complementation and to form clusters of genes which are ""recombination deserts"". The phenomenon of switching in-between the purifying selection and haplotype complementation has a phase transition character, and many relations between the effective population size, coding density, chromosome size and recombination frequency are those of the power law type.",10,[],10

Numerical evaluation for GE by the random simulation is also implemented in order to demonstrate the validity of the reductions. Our calculations show that GE is saturated by a finite value with the increment of particle number, that means that the total entanglement for VBS state would be divergent under the thermodynamic limit. Moreover it is found that the scaling behavior of GE with spin number equation is fitted as equation, in which the values of the parameters equation are only dependent on the parity of spin equation.

These multi-photon states are two-mode squeezed by 6.0 dB with a variable orientation of squeezing and displaced by a few vacuum units. This range encompasses typical input alphabets for a continuous variable quantum information protocol. The memory consists of two cells, one for each mode, filled with cesium atoms at room temperature with a memory time of about 1msec.

In this work, we consider simple models to examine the effect of symmetries of delocalized multi-excitation states on the dynamical timescales, including hopping rates, radiative decay, and environmental interactions. While the decoherence (pure dephasing) rate of an extended state over N sites is comparable to that of a non-extended state, superradiance leads to a factor of N enhancement in decay and absorption rates. In addition to superradiance, we illustrate how the multi-excitonic states exhibit `supertransfer' in the far-field regime: hopping from a symmetrized state over N sites to a symmetrized state over M sites at a rate proportional to MN. We argue that such symmetries could play an operational role in physical systems based on the competition between symmetry-enhanced interactions and localized inhomogeneities and environmental interactions that destroy symmetry.

1005.1975,quant-ph,"Is there a meaningful quantum counterpart to public communication? We argue that the symmetric-side channel -- which distributes quantum information symmetrically between the receiver and the environment -- is a good candidate for a notion of public quantum communication in entanglement distillation and quantum error correction.   This connection is partially motivated by [Brand\~ao and Oppenheim, arXiv:1004.3328], where it was found that if a sender would like to communicate a secret message to a receiver through an insecure quantum channel using a shared quantum state as a key, then the insecure quantum channel is only ever used to simulate a symmetric-side channel, and can always be replaced by it without altering the optimal rate. Here we further show, in complete analogy to the role of public classical communication, that assistance by a symmetric-side channel makes equal the distillable entanglement, the recently-introduced mutual independence, and a generalization of the latter, which quantifies the extent to which one of the parties can perform quantum privacy amplification.   Symmetric-side channels, and the closely related erasure channel, have been recently harnessed to provide examples of superactivation of the quantum channel capacity. Our findings give new insight into this non-additivity of the channel capacity and its relation to quantum privacy.

There are well-known limitations to optical single-photon-based qubit and multi-photon-based qumode implementations of quantum communication and quantum computation, when the toolbox is restricted to the most practical set of linear operations and resources such as linear optics and Gaussian operations and states. The recent hybrid approaches aim at pushing the feasibility, the efficiencies, and the fidelities of the linear schemes to the limits, potentially adding weak or measurement-induced nonlinearities to the toolbox.",10,[],6
1008.4013,quant-ph,"Quantum discord witnesses the nonclassicality of quantum states even when there is no entanglement in these quantum states. This type of quantum correlation also has some interesting and significant applications in quantum information processing. Quantum discord has been evaluated explicitly only for certain class of two-qubit states. We extend the previous studies to equation quantum systems and derive an analytical expression for quantum discord for a two-parameter class of states for equation. We compare quantum discord, classical correlation, and entanglement for qubit-qutrit systems to demonstrate that different measures of quantum correlation are not identical and conceptually different.",10,[],6
1003.0743,quant-ph,"We propose a mechanics of a massive particle in a potential field effective for both classical and quantum system as a modified classical analytical mechanics (modified CM). We transform, under coordinate transformation, the covariant tensor of order two in the Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) eq. of CM, not with the classical action, but with extended action of diffeomorphism group. Then, the H-J eq., a first-order partial differential eq., is modified to a third-order one. The Euler-Lagrange (E-L) eq. of CM, a second-order ordinary differential eq., related to the H-J eq. through the action integral is accordingly modified to a fourth-order one. Thus obtained mechanics accommodates quantum phenomena due to the higher-order eqs., and always gives trajectory unlike quantum mechanics (QM) due to the E-L eq. Discrete energy levels of a particle in a confining potential are the same as those of QM because quantization criterion is equivalent. Particle distribution in an ensemble disagrees with that of QM even if initial distribution is set identical because dynamics is different; it however agrees with observed data to date within experimental uncertainty. The mechanics thus is a testable alternative to QM.",10,[],6
1003.5213,quant-ph,"The high-precision interferometric measurement of an unknown phase is the basis for metrology in many areas of science and technology. Quantum entanglement provides an increase in sensitivity, but present techniques have only surpassed the limits of classical interferometry for the measurement of small variations about a known phase. Here we introduce a technique that combines entangled states with an adaptive algorithm to precisely estimate a completely unspecified phase, obtaining more information per photon that is possible classically. We use the technique to make the first ab initio entanglement-enhanced optical phase measurement. This approach will enable rapid, precise determination of unknown phase shifts using interferometry.",10,[],6
1012.2536,quant-ph,"It is argued that realism and true randomness are fully compatible. Realistic true random events are acts of pure creation that obey strict laws, but do not necessarily satisfy Kolmogorov's axioms of probabilities. Realistic true randomness is some sort of nondeterministic force, or propensity of physical systems to manifest such and such properties under such and such conditions. Realistic random events reflect preexisting properties, as required by realism, simply the reflection is not deterministic; still, the preexisting properties determine the propensities of the different possible events.   It is argued that deterministic extensions of quantum physics are necessarily incompatible with special relativity. Hence, from today's violations of Bell's inequalities one can conclude that all future physics theories will display true randomness as does quantum physics.   It is argued that accepting true randomness and realism leads to new questions with interesting answers, allowing one 1) to study nonlocality in configurations with many independent sources and 2) to bound how much free will is needed for a proper violation of Bell's inequality.",10,[],6
1007.1875,quant-ph,"Oblivious transfer is a fundamental primitive in cryptography. While perfect information theoretic security is impossible, quantum oblivious transfer protocols can limit the dishonest players' cheating. Finding the optimal security parameters in such protocols is an important open question. In this paper we show that every 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer protocol allows a dishonest party to cheat with probability bounded below by a constant strictly larger than 1/2. Alice's cheating is defined as her probability of guessing Bob's index, and Bob's cheating is defined as his probability of guessing both input bits of Alice. In our proof, we relate these cheating probabilities to the cheating probabilities of a coin flipping protocol and conclude by using Kitaev's coin flipping lower bound. Then, we present an oblivious transfer protocol with two messages and cheating probabilities at most 3/4. Last, we extend Kitaev's semidefinite programming formulation to more general primitives, where the security is against a dishonest player trying to force the outcome of the other player, and prove optimal lower and upper bounds for them.",10,[],6
1005.0282,quant-ph,"We investigate the evolution of a Zeeman coherence grating induced in a cold atomic cesium sample in the presence of an external magnetic field. The gratings are created in a three-beam light storage configuration using two quasi-collinear writing laser pulses and reading with a counterpropagating pulse after a variable time delay. The phase conjugated pulse arising from the atomic sample is monitored. Collapses and revivals of the retrieved pulse are observed for different polarizations of the laser beams and for different directions of the applied magnetic field. While magnetic field inhomogeneities are responsible for the decay of the coherent atomic response, a five-fold increase in the coherence decay time, with respect to no applied magnetic field, is obtained for an appropriate choice of the direction of the applied magnetic field. A simplified theoretical model illustrates the role of the magnetic field mean and its inhomogeneity on the collective atomic response.",10,[],6
1003.0432,quant-ph,"We experimentally demonstrate that the nonlocal nature of time-bin entangled photonic qubits persists when one or two qubits of the pair are converted to polarization qubits. This is possible by implementing a novel Universal Time-Bin Qubit Analyzer (UTBA), which, for the first time, allows analyzing time-bin qubits in any basis. We reveal the nonlocal nature of the emitted light by violating the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality with measurement bases exploring all the dimensions of the Bloch sphere. Moreover, we conducted experiments where one qubit is transmitted over a 12.4 km underground fiber link and demonstrate the suitability of our scheme for use in a real-world setting. The resulting entanglement can also be interpreted as hybrid entanglement between different types of degrees of freedom of two physical systems, which could prove useful in large scale, heterogeneous quantum networks. This work opens new possibilities for testing nonlocality and for implementing new quantum communication protocols with time-bin entanglement.",10,[],6

Although the protocol leaks small information for a security parameter equation, the scheme still preserves its information-theoretic secrecy, and reduces some pre-shared classical secret keys for a private quantum channel between a sender and two receivers. The approximate private quantum channels constructed via random unitary channels play a crucial role in the proposed quantum state sharing protocol.",10,[],6
1011.2497,quant-ph,"For a quantum computer acting on d-dimensional systems, we analyze the computational power of circuits wherein stabilizer operations are perfect and we allow access to imperfect non-stabilizer states or operations. If the noise rate affecting the non-stabilizer resource is sufficiently high, then these states and operations can become simulable in the sense of the Gottesman-Knill theorem, reducing the overall power of the circuit to no better than classical. In this paper we find the depolarizing noise rate at which this happens, and consequently the most robust non-stabilizer states and non-Clifford gates. In doing so, we make use of the discrete Wigner function and derive facets of the so-called qudit Clifford polytope i.e. the inequalities defining the convex hull of all qudit Clifford gates. Our results for robust states are provably optimal. For robust gates we find a critical noise rate that, as dimension increases, rapidly approaches the the theoretical optimum of 100%. Some connections with the question of qudit magic state distillation are discussed.",10,[],6
1007.0403,quant-ph,"Quantum interfaces between polarized atomic ensembles and coherent states of light, applied recently to manipulate bipartite and multipartite entanglement, are revisited by means of a continuous-variable formalism. The explicit use of the continuous-variable formalism facilitates significantly the analysis of entanglement between different modes, reducing it to the study of the properties of a final covariance matrix which can be found analytically. Furthermore, it allows to study matter-light interfaces for mixed states, adapting the formalism to the experimental situations in which the initial prepared Gaussian states are, unavoidably, affected by a certain amount of noise. A multipartite scenario, leading to the generation of macroscopic cluster states is presented and analyzed in detail within this formalism.",10,[],6

1010.5452,quant-ph,"Modal quantum theory (MQT) is a simplified cousin of ordinary Hilbert space quantum theory. We show that two important theorems of actual quantum theory, the Kochen-Specker theorem excluding non-contextual hidden variables and the Conway-Kochen ""free will theorem"" about entangled systems, have direct analogues in MQT. The proofs of these analogue theorems are similar to, but much simpler than, the originals. We also show that the structure of possible measurement results for an entangled system in MQT cannot be represented by probability assignments satisfying the no-signaling principle, such as those given by ordinary quantum theory.",10,[],6
1001.3693,quant-ph,"The angular part of the Schrodinger equation for a central potential is brought to the one-dimensional 'Schrodinger form' where one has a kinetic energy plus potential energy terms. The resulting polar potential is seen to be a family of potentials characterized by the square of the magnetic quantum number m. It is demonstrated that this potential can be viewed as a confining potential that attempts to confine the particle to the xy-plane, with a strength that increases with increasing m. Linking the solutions of the equation to the conventional solutions of the angular equation, i.e. the associated Legendre functions, we show that the variation in the spatial distribution of the latter for different values of the orbital angular quantum number l can be viewed as being a result of 'squeezing' with different strengths by the introduced 'polar potential'.",10,[],6
1011.1217,quant-ph,"Electron and nuclear spins have been employed in many of the early demonstrations of quantum technology (QT). However applications in real world QT are limited by the difficulty of measuring single spins.

The model we employ corresponds to an extremely simple experimental system: a homogenous Ising-coupled spin lattice in one, two or three dimensions, driven by a continuous microwave field. We establish that the process can operate at finite temperature (imperfect initial polarisation) and under the effects of various forms of decoherence.",10,[],6
1010.2298,quant-ph,"We study optimal perfect distinguishability between a unitary and a general quantum operation. In 2-dimensional case we provide a simple sufficient and necessary condition for sequential perfect distinguishability and an analytical formula of optimal query time. We extend the sequential condition to general d-dimensional case. Meanwhile, we provide an upper bound and a lower bound for optimal sequential query time. In the process a new iterative method is given, the most notable innovation of which is its independence to auxiliary systems or entanglement. Following the idea, we further obtain an upper bound and a lower bound of (entanglement-assisted) q-maximal fidelities between a unitary and a quantum operation. Thus by the recursion in [1] an upper bound and a lower bound for optimal general perfect discrimination are achieved. Finally our lower bound result can be extended to the case of arbitrary two quantum operations.",10,[],6

1002.0959,quant-ph,"Quantum entanglement is the quintessential characteristic of quantum mechanics and the basis for quantum information processing. When one of two maximally entangled particles is measured, without measurement the state of another one is determined simultaneously no matter how far the two particles is from each other. How can these phenomena take place since no object can move faster than light speed in a vacuum? The key problem is due to the ignorance of the interaction between a particle and a quantum vacuum. Just like the case where a gun suffers recoil from its firing of a bullet, when a particle is created from the quantum vacuum, the vacuum will be somewhat ""broken"" correspondingly, which can be described by a shadow state in the vacuum. Through their shadows in the vacuum two quantum entangled particles can have a distance-independent instantaneous interaction with each other. Quantum teleportation, quantum swap, and wave function collapse are explained in a similar way. Quantum object can be interpreted as a composite made up of a particle and the shadowed quantum vacuum which is responsible for the wave characteristic of the particle wave duality. The quantum vacuum is not only the origin of all possible kinds of particles, but also the origin and the core of Eastern mystics.",10,[],6

Moreover, the effect of the frequency difference between the interatomic transition and the electromagnetic field is also analyzed. We show that, adjusting the considered parametres of the non-linear media and frequency difference leads to a strong control of the degree of entanglement where excellent periodicity of entanglement evolution can be obtained which is very important in predicting the behavior of transmitted information through the application of various information processing schemes. We present a detailed and comparative study of atom-atom entanglement for two cases corresponding to different injections of the two atoms into the cavity field.

1003.0038,quant-ph,"This thesis is divided into two parts. In Part I we introduce a new formalism for quantum strategies, which specify the actions of one party in any multi-party interaction involving the exchange of multiple quantum messages among the parties. This formalism associates with each strategy a single positive semidefinite operator acting only upon the tensor product of the input and output message spaces for the strategy. We establish three fundamental properties of this new representation for quantum strategies and we list several applications, including a quantum version of von Neumann's celebrated 1928 Min-Max Theorem for zero-sum games and an efficient algorithm for computing the value of such a game.   In Part II we establish several properties of a class of quantum operations that can be implemented locally with shared quantum entanglement or classical randomness. In particular, we establish the existence of a ball of local operations with shared randomness lying within the space spanned by the no-signaling operations and centred at the completely noisy channel. The existence of this ball is employed to prove that the weak membership problem for local operations with shared entanglement is strongly NP-hard. We also provide characterizations of local operations in terms of linear functionals that are positive and ""completely"" positive on a certain cone of Hermitian operators, under a natural notion of complete positivity appropriate to that cone.

A particular process we will focus on is spontaneous emission, usually recognized as an irreversible loss of information and entanglement encoded in the internal states of the system. We illustrate some certain circumstances where this irreversible process can in fact induce entanglement between separated systems. We also show how spontaneous emission reveals a competition between the Bell states of a two qubit system that leads to the recently discovered ""sudden"" features in the temporal evolution of entanglement. An another problem illustrated in details is a deterministic preparation of atoms and atomic ensembles in long-lived stationary squeezed states and entangled cluster states.
