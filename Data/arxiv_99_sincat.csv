astro-ph/9901230,astro-ph,We report on the BeppoSAX/WFC observation of a strong type-I X-ray burst from the recently discovered transient source SAX J1810.8-2609. The observed event showed evidence of photospheric radius expansion due to super-Eddington burst luminosity. Burst detection identifies the source as a probable low-mass X-ray binary harbouring a neutron star.,1999,[],5
astro-ph/9910410,astro-ph,"We investigate the evolution of the 0.5-2 keV soft X-ray luminosity function (SXLF) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) using results from ROSAT surveys of various depth, ranging from shallow large-area ROSAT All-Sky Survey -based samples to the deepest pointed observation on the Lockman Hole. As previously found, the SXLF evolves rapidly as a function of redshift up to z\sim 1.5 and is consistent with remaining constant beyond this redshift.   We found that a form of the Luminosity-Dependent Density Evolution (LDDE) gives an excellent fit to the data. Extrapolating one form of the LDDE model (LDDE1) explains \approx 60% of the estimated soft extragalactic Cosmic X-ray Background (CXRB). We have also found another representation (LDDE2), which produces \approx 90% of the CXRB and still gives an excellent fit to the sample AGNs. These two versions of the LDDE models can be considered two extremes of the possible extrapolations of the SXLF below the flux limit.   We have also investigated the evolution of the number density of luminous QSOs. Unlike these QSOs, the ROSAT-selected QSOs do not show evidence for the decrease of the number density in z>3. The statistical significance of the difference is, however, marginal.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9904131,astro-ph,"A hypothesis of curvature pressure is used to derive a static and stable cosmology with a tired-light redshift. The idea is that the high energy particles in the inter-galactic medium do not travel along geodesics because of the strong electrostatic forces. The result is a reaction back on the medium that is seen as an additional pressure. Combined with the explanation of the Hubble redshift as a gravitational interaction results in a static and stable cosmology. The predicted Hubble constant is 60.2 km/s/Mpc, the predicted background microwave temperature is 3 degrees and quasar luminosity functions and angular size distributions are shown to be consistent with the model. Since most observations that imply dark matter rely on redshift data it is argued that there is no dark matter. Observations of quasar absorption lines, supernovae light curves and the Butcher-Oemler effect are discussed. The curvature pressure is important for stellar structure and may explain the solar neutrino deficiency.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9910233,astro-ph,The main ingredients of recent semi-analytic models of galaxy formation are summarised. We present predictions for the galaxy clustering properties of a well specified LCDM model whose parameters are constrained by observed local galaxy properties. We present preliminary predictions for evolution of clustering that can be probed with deep pencil beam surveys.,1999,[],5
astro-ph/9907355,astro-ph,"We present a catalog containing 290 LMC and 590 SMC Cepheids which have been obtained using the two 4k equation 8k CCD cameras of the EROS~2 microlensing survey. The Cepheids were selected from 1,134,000 and 504,000 stars in the central regions of the LMC and SMC respectively, that were monitored over 150 nights between October 1996 and February 1997, at a rate of one measurement every night. For each Cepheid the light curves, period, magnitudes in the EROS~2 filter system, Fourier coefficients, J2000 coordinates and cross-identifications with objects referenced in the CDS Simbad database are presented. Finding charts of identified Cepheids in clusters NGC 1943, NGC 1958 and Bruck 56 are presented. The catalogue and the individual light--curves will be electronically available through the CDS (Strasbourg).",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9905350,astro-ph,"We have observed the center of the Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy IC 1613 with WFPC2 aboard the Hubble Space Telescope in the F439W, F555W, and F814W filters. We find a dominant old stellar population (aged ~7 Gyr), identifiable by the strong red giant branch (RGB) and red clump populations. From the (V-I) color of the RGB, we estimate a mean metallicity of the intermediate-age stellar population [Fe/H] = -1.38 /- 0.31. We confirm a distance of 715 /- 40 kpc using the I-magnitude of the RGB tip. The main-sequence luminosity function down to I ~25 provides evidence for a roughly constant SFR of approximately 0.00035 solar masses per year across the WFPC2 field of view (0.22 square kpc) during the past 250-350 Myr. Structure in the blue loop luminosity function implies that the SFR was ~50% higher 400-900 Myr ago than today. The mean heavy element abundance of these young stars is 1/10th solar. The best explanation for a red spur on the main-sequence at I = 24.7 is the blue horizontal branch component of a very old stellar population at the center of IC 1613. We have also imaged a broader area of IC 1613 using the 3.5-meter WIYN telescope under excellent seeing conditions. The AGB-star luminosity function is consistent with a period of continuous star formation over at least the age range 2-10 Gyr. We present an approximate age-metallicity relation for IC 1613, which appears similar to that of the Small Magellanic Cloud. We compare the Hess diagram of IC 1613 to similar data for three other Local Group dwarf galaxies, and find that it most closely resembles the nearby, transition-type dwarf galaxy Pegasus (DDO 216).",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9906352,astro-ph,A new technique is used to derive the extinction and age of populations in the interacting galaxies NGC5194 & NGC5195 from high S/N multicolor photometric data. A new evolutionary scenario of the interaction is proposed.,1999,[],5
astro-ph/9906114,astro-ph,"The theory of diffusive particle acceleration explains the spectral properties of the cosmic rays below energies of approx. 106 GeV as produced at strong shocks in supernova remnants (SNR's). To supply the observed flux of cosmic rays, a significant fraction of the energy released by a supernova has to be transfered to cosmic rays. The key to the question of the efficiency of SNR's in producing cosmic rays is the injection process from thermal energies. A self-consistent model has to take into account the interaction of the accelerated particles with magneto-hydrodynamic waves, which generate the particle diffusion, a requisite for the acceleration process. Such a nonlinear model of the turbulent background plasma has been developed recently (Malkov, 1998, Phys. Rev. E 58, 4911). We use this model for the first numerical treatment of the gas dynamics and the diffusion-convection equation at a quasi-parallel strong shock, which incorporates a plasma-physical injection model to investigate the cosmic ray production.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9905097,astro-ph,"The nuclear rotation curve of M31, as observed by the Hubble Space Telescope Faint Object Camera Spectrograph, shows a significant disturbance coinciding with the off-center brightness peak, P1. This /- 60 km/s feature is distinguished by a local velocity maximum centered on P1 and a local minimum approxmately 0.08"" closer to P2. If the M31 double nucleus is an eccentric disk with an off-center density concentration, as suggested by Tremaine, then the self-gravity of the disk can produce just such a disturbance. The expected kinematic signature is calculated approximately by examining sequences of closed periodic orbits in a Kepler potential perturbed by a model disk potential that precesses at constant frequency. The perturbation forces a steep negative eccentricity gradient in the sequence of closed orbits through the densest part of the disk, which reverses the arrangement of periapsis and apoapsis with respect to the central mass. Stars making up the inner part of the density concentration are at apoapsis, while stars making up the outer part are at periapsis, producing a steep local velocity gradient. This result is independent of the details of the mass distribution. The projected rotation curve of the model is shown to closely resemble that of M31, giving strong support to the eccentric disk picture.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9907004,astro-ph,"The process of data taking, reduction and calibration of near-infrared imaging polarimetry data taken with the ESO Adaptive Optics System ADONIS is described. The ADONIS polarimetric facility is provided by a rotating wire grid polarizer. Images were taken at increments of 22.5 degrees of polarizer rotation from 0 to 180 degrees, over-sampling the polarization curve but allowing the effects of photometric variations to be assessed. Several strategies to remove the detector signature are described. The instrumental polarization was determined, by observations of stars of negligible polarization, to be 1.7% at J, H and K bands. The lack of availability of unpolarized standard stars in the IR, in particular which are not too bright as to saturate current IR detectors, is highlighted. The process of making polarization maps is described. Experiments at restoring polarimetry data, in order to reach diffraction limited polarization, are outlined, with particular reference to data on the Homunculus reflection nebula around Eta Carinae.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9910278,astro-ph,"We focus on two aspects of Omega Cen that are rather uncharacteristic of globular clusters: its metallicity distribution and its orbit. We use (1) a Washington (M-T2,M)o color-magnitude diagram containing 130,000 stars, (2) DDO51 photometry to separate out giants from field dwarfs, and (3) a mapping of (M-T2,M-DDO51)o colors to [Fe/H] to derive a metallicity distribution function (MDF) for Omega Cen. The MDF is corrected for field giant contamination by a radial velocity membership study of a subsample of stars spanning all abundances. As with previous studies, the MDF is very wide with a peak near [Fe/H]=-1.7 and extending to both higher and lower abundance, but with few stars having [Fe/H] >~ -1.2. The orbit of Omega Cen is strongly retrograde, has small apogalacticon and is almost coplanar with the Milky Way disk -- i.e., an orbit unlike any known for almost all Galactic globular clusters, and unique among clusters with its horizontal branch type and [Fe/H]. We propose that the MDF and orbit of Omega Cen, when considered in light of other unusual Omega Cen properties are consistent with a picture wherein this object is the remains (nucleus) of a once larger satellite dwarf galaxy that has been substantially reduced by tidal stripping. A model wherein Omega Cen faced considerable stripping by the Galactic disk can account for the cluster's current state. A present-day counterpart of this process may be the Sagittarius dSph system, for which the globular cluster M54 (which has a mass similar to Omega Cen) has been purported to be the nucleus. A larger proto-Omega Cen on a retrograde orbit plowing through the Milky Way disk may have aided thick disk formation both through the contribution of tidally stripped stars and through substantial thin disk heating.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9912193,astro-ph,"We performed time-resolved spectroscopic studies of the double-eclipsing dwarf nova EX Dra (formerly HS 1804  6753) in order to locate line emitting sites in the system. Optical spectra recorded during the quiescent as well as during the outburst state have been analysed by means of Doppler tomography. The computed Doppler images map the system in a variety of emission lines and allow us to compare between different temperatures and accretion states.   Our studies revealed that the Balmer and HeI emission of EX Dra during quiescence is mainly formed within a fully established disk and within the gas stream. The Doppler map of Halpha shows a second emission spot in the accretion disk located far from the region of interaction between the as stream and the accretion disk.   We have found a weak hint that secondary star emission contributes to the Halpha line in quiescence, obviously caused by photospheric heating due to irradiation by the primary component. During outburst secondary star emission turns into a very strong emission source in the Balmer lines due to the increased accretion rate and an enhanced irradiation by the white dwarf or the boundary layer. The Doppler maps of the Balmer and HeI lines during outburst further show emission from the accretion disk. During outburst the gas stream is rarely seen in the Balmer lines but clearly visible in HeI and shows that the disk radius during this high accretion state is about 0.2 RL1 larger than during the recorded quiescent state.   The origin of the CII (4267 Angstroem) line, which is only detectable during outburst can be located by Doppler imaging close to the primary component and may therefore be formed in the chromosphere of the white dwarf.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9910049,astro-ph,"The problem of (non)random distribution of points on sphere and in space is investigated. The procedure for obtaining preferred direction (and plane) for points on the sphere (in the sky) and in the space is discussed.   At present, directions of perihelia of the observed long-period comets cannot be considered to be distributed uniformly in the sky (contrary of the statement made by Neslu\vsan 1996). The action of galactic disk should increase the concentration in the zone of galactic latitude equation, unless the observational selection effects play an important role.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9908325,astro-ph,This introductory talk to the 1999 Victoria Conference on Large-Scale Flows will present the 'big questions' which will be discussed in the conference: (a) Does the velocity field converge on the largest scales? (b) Why can't we agree on the value of beta? (c) How can we properly measure the small-scale velocity dispersion? (d) Just how complicated can biasing be? (e) How universal are the distance indicators we are using? (f) How do we design our next generation of surveys to answer the above questions?,1999,[],5
astro-ph/9911275,astro-ph,"Estimations of magnetic fields of neutron stars, observed as radio and X-ray pulsars, are discussed. It is shown, that theoretical and observational values for different types of radiopulsars are in good correspondence. Magnetic fields of X-ray pulsars are estimated from the cyclotron line energy. In the case of Her X-1 this estimation exceeds considerably the value of its magnetic field obtained from long term observational data related to the beam structure evolution. Another interpretation of the cyclotron feature, based on the relativistic dipole radiation mechanism, could remove this discrepancy. Observational data about soft gamma repeators and their interpretation as magnetars are analyzed.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9911411,astro-ph,"The evolution of two-point space correlation function of QSOs is analyzed in the framework of the theory of the large scale structure formation. For given cosmological models the agreement between theoretical predictions and observational data on correlation function of QSOs is achieved by determination of scales of structures R(z), in which could be formed quasars at different redshifts z. It is shown that quasars could be formed in the nucleus of massive galaxies or groups of galaxies owing to merges at their central region. It depends on an amplitude of the power spectrum of the initial matter density fluctuations at galaxy-cluster scales.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9907231,astro-ph,"We investigate the statistical evolution of magnetic neutron stars, recycled in binary systems, simulating synthetic populations. To bracket uncertainties, we consider a soft (FP) and a stiff (PS) equation of state (EoS) for nuclear matter and explore the hypothesis that the magnetic field is confined in the stellar crust. We follow the magneto-rotational evolution within a simple recycling scenario, including the possibility of magnetospheric propeller.   We find the presence of a tail in the period distribution of the synthetic populations at periods shorter than 1.558 ms, the minimum detected so far. For the soft EoS the recycling gives rise to a spin distribution which is increasing monotonically toward short periods and a clear 'barrier' forms at the minimum period for the onset of mass shedding. For the stiff EoS the distribution is flatter displaying a broad maximum about 2-4 ms.   The estimated fraction of neutron stars spinning close to their shedding limit over the millisecond pulsar population is found to be significant. Crustal magnetic field decay models predict the existence of massive (M>1.4 Msun) rapidly spinning neutron stars with very low magnetic moment.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9910121,astro-ph,"We have examined the physical conditions in the narrow-line region of the well-studied Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151, using long-slit spectra obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (HST/STIS). The data were taken along a position angle of 221 degrees, centered on the optical nucleus. We have generated photoionization models for a contiguous set of radial zones, out to 2.3 arcsec in projected position to the southwest of the nucleus, and 2.7 arcsec to the northeast. Given the uncertainties in the reddening correction, the calculated line ratios successfully matched nearly all the dereddened ratios. We find that the narrow-line region consists of dusty atomic gas photoionized by a power-law continuum that has been modified by transmission through a mix of low and high ionization gas, specifically UV and X-ray absorbing components. The physical characteristics of the absorbers resemble those observed along our line of sight to the nucleus, although the column density of the X-ray absorber is a factor of ten less than observed. The large inferred covering factor of the absorbing gas is in agreement with the results of our previous study of UV absorption in Seyfert 1 galaxies. We find evidence, specifically the suppression of L-alpha, that we are observing the back-end of dusty ionized clouds in the region southwest of the nucleus. Since these clouds are blueshifted, this supports the interpretation of the cloud kinematics as being due to radial outflow from the nucleus. We find that the narrow-line gas at each radial position is inhomogeneous, and can be modeled as consisting of a radiation-bounded component and a more tenuous, matter-bounded component. The density of the narrow-line gas dropswith increasing radial distance, which confirms our earlier results.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9911185,astro-ph,"The Parkes multibeam pulsar survey uses a 13-element receiver operating at a wavelength of 20 cm to survey the inner Galactic plane with remarkable sensitivity. To date we have collected and analyzed data from 45% of the survey region (b < 5 deg.; 260 deg. < l < 50 deg.), and have discovered 440 pulsars, in addition to re-detecting 190 previously known ones. Most of the newly discovered pulsars are at great distances, as inferred from a median dispersion measure (DM) of 400 pc/cm3.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9904400,astro-ph,"Recent observations give some clues that the lenses discovered by the microlensing experiments in the direction of the Magellanic Clouds may be located in these satellite galaxies. We re-examine the possibility that self-lensing alone may account for the optical depth measured towards the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We present a self-consistent multi-component model of the LMC consisting of distinct stellar populations, each associated to a vertical velocity dispersion ranging from 10 to 60 km/s. The present work focuses on showing that such dispersions comply with current 20 - 30 km/s limits set by observation on specific LMC populations. We also show that this model reproduces both the 1-2 10-7 observed optical depth and the event duration distribution.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9912408,astro-ph,"We introduce a new method for generating initial conditions consistent with highly nonlinear observations of density and velocity fields. Using a variant of the Least Action method, called Perturbative Least Action (PLA), we show that it is possible to generate several different sets of initial conditions, each of which will satisfy a set of highly nonlinear observational constraints at the present day. We then discuss a code written to test and apply this method and present the results of several simulations.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9908150,astro-ph,"We perform a spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopic study of a set of 11 relaxed clusters of galaxies observed by the ROSAT/PSPC and ASCA/SIS. Using a method which corrects for the energy dependent effects of the ASCA PSF based on ROSAT images, we constrain the spatial distribution of Ne, Si, S and Fe in each cluster. Theoretical prescriptions for the chemical yields of Type Ia and II supernovae, then allow determination of the Fe enrichment from both types of supernovae as a function of radius within each cluster. Using optical measurements from the literature, we also determine the iron mass-to-light ratio (IMLR) separately for Fe synthesized in both types of supernovae. For clusters with the best photon statistics, we find that the total Fe abundance decreases significantly with radius, while the Si abundance is either flat or decreases less rapidly, resulting in an increasing Si/Fe ratio with radius. This result indicates a greater predominance of Type II SNe enrichment at large radii in clusters. We suggest that the high Si/Fe ratios in the outskirts of rich clusters may arise from enrichment by Type II SNe released to ICM via galactic star burst driven winds. Abridged.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9907125,astro-ph,"The radio spectral index map of the Coma halo shows a progressive steepening of the spectral index with increasing radius. Such a steepening cannot be simply justified by models involving continuous injection of fresh particles in the Coma halo or by models involving diffusion of fresh electrons from the central regions. We propose a scenario in which the relativistic particles injected in the Coma cluster by some processes (merger, accretion shocks, turbulence) are systematically reaccelerated for a relatively long time (equation 1Gyr). We show that such a scenario can account for the synchrotron radio spectral index distribution, for the radio halo size at different frequencies, and for the total (integrated) radio spectrum of the Coma halo. We also show that for a suitable choice of the parameters the model can also account for the hard X-ray flux observed by BeppoSAX via the inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background radiation by the synchrotron electrons. The possibility to account for the EUV flux detected with the EUVE satellite by the inverse Compton emission is also discussed.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9905276,astro-ph,"The optical afterglows of the gamma ray bursts can be strongly polarized, in principle up to tens of percents, if: (i) the afterglow is synchrotron radiation from an ultra-relativistic blast, (ii) the blast is beamed during the afterglow phase, i.e. the shock propagates within a narrow jet, (iii) we observe at the right time from the right viewing angle, (iv) magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the jet have different proper strengths.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9912210,astro-ph,"Collisional ring galaxies probably result from a head-on collision between a compact companion galaxy and a gas-rich disk system. We present a review of the discovery of warm dust in five collisional rings observed by ISO which range in total Far-IR luminosity from 10equation~ equation ~Lequation ~equation ~10equation Lequation. The results show that in most cases, the mid-IR (MIR) flux is often a significant fraction of the total energy budget of star formation activity in these galaxies (at least 10% even in the least powerful cases). We argue that the MIR emission, when combined with optical and radio observations, allows us to build a more complete picture of activity in these collisional systems. Although not as extreme as ULIRGs, these collisional systems provide low-redshift examples of the early effects of galaxy collisions on the ISM and may be relevant to the collisional assembly of galaxy disk components at high redshift.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9911151,astro-ph,"We present the first results of the Karhunen-Lo\`eve (KL) eigenmodes applied to real data of the Las Campanas Redshift Survey (LCRS) to simultaneously measure the values of the redshift-distortion parameter, equation, the linearly extrapolated normalization, equation, and the CDM shape parameter, equation. The results of our numerical likelihood analysis indicate a low value of equation, a shape parameter equation, and a linearly extrapolated normalization equation, which are consistent with a low density universe, equation.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9908339,astro-ph,"I perform a joint counts-in-cells analysis of galaxies of different spectral types using the Las Campanas Redshift Survey (LCRS). Using a maximum-likelihood technique to fit for the relationship between the density fields of early- and late-type galaxies, I find a relative linear bias of equation. This technique can probe the nonlinearity and stochasticity of the relationship as well. However, the degree to which nonlinear and stochastic fits improve upon the linear fit turns out to depend on the redshift range in question. In particular, there seems to be a systematic difference between the high- and low-redshift halves of the data (respectively, further than and closer than equation km/s); all of the signal of stochasticity and nonlinearity comes from the low-redshift portion. Analysis of mock catalogs shows that the peculiar geometry and variable flux limits of the LCRS do not cause this effect. I speculate that the central surface brightness selection criteria of the LCRS may be responsible.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9907081,astro-ph,"By combining SIM observations with ground-based photometry, one can completely solve microlensing events seen toward the Galactic bulge. One could measure the mass, distance, and transverse velocity of ~100 lenses to ~5% precision in only ~500 hours of SIM time. Among the numerous applications are 1) measurement of the mass functions (MFs) of the bulge and disk 2) measurement of the relative normalizations of the bulge and disk MFs (and so their relative contribution to the Galactic potential), 3) measurement of the number of bulge white dwarfs and neutron stars (and so the initial MF well above the present turnoff). SIM astrometric measurements are simultaneously photometric measurements. SIM astrometry determines the angular size of the Einstein ring on the sky, and comparison of SIM and ground-based photometry determines the size of the Einstein ring projected onto the observer plane. Only by combining both of these measurements is it possible to completely solve the microlensing events.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9905042,astro-ph,"In this paper we describe a new class of pulsating stars, the prototype of which is the bright, early, F-type dwarf, Gamma Doradus. These stars typically have between 1 and 5 periods ranging from 0.4 to 3 days with photometric amplitudes up to 0.1 in Johnson V. The mechanism for these observed variations is high-order, low-degree, non-radial, gravity-mode pulsation. Gamma Doradus stars exhibit variability on a time scale that is an order of magnitude slower than Delta Scuti stars. They may offer additional insight into stellar physics when they are better understood (e.g., they may represent the cool portion of an ""iron opacity instability strip"" currently formed by the Beta Cephei stars, the SPB stars, and the subdwarf B stars; they may also offer insight into the presence of g-modes in solar-like stars).",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9907165,astro-ph,"We discuss the tight interconnection between microlensing optical depths, flattening of dark haloes and low-to-intermediate redshift baryonic census. By analysing plots of the microlensing optical depth as a function of galactic coordinates for different values of axis ratio equation of the galactic MACHO halo, we have shown that observations are best described by a flattened halo with equation. There is no dynamical obstacle for such a choice of global halo shape. Both extremely flattened equation and spherical equation haloes have several difficulties, although not of equal severity. Consequences of such flattening for the cosmological density fraction contained in MACHOs are considered and comparison with mass in low and intermediate-redshift Lyequation forest and other plausible reservoirs of gas is discussed in context of a unified description of the evolution of baryonic content of the universe.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9911340,astro-ph,"We present ASCA observations of LINERs without broad Hequation emission in their optical spectra. The sample of ""type 2"" LINERs consists of NGC 404, 4111, 4192, 4457, and 4569. We have detected X-ray emission from all the objects except for NGC 404; among the detected objects are two so-called transition objects (NGC 4192 and NGC 4569), which have been postulated to be composite nuclei having both an HII region and a LINER component. The images of NGC 4111 and NGC 4569 in the soft (0.5-2 keV) and hard (2-7 keV) X-ray bands are extended on scales of several kpc. The X-ray spectra of NGC 4111, NGC 4457 and NGC 4569 are well fitted by a two-component model that consists of soft thermal emission with equation keV and a hard component represented by a power law (photon index equation 2) or by thermal bremsstrahlung emission (equation several keV). The extended hard X-rays probably come from discrete sources, while the soft emission most likely originates from hot gas produced by active star formation in the host galaxy. We have found no clear evidence for the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the sample. If an AGN component is the primary ionization source of the optical emission lines, then it must be heavily obscured with a column density significantly larger than equation cmequation. Alternatively, the optical emission could be ionized by a population of exceptionally hot stars.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9904047,astro-ph,"Study of the polarization of supernovae has suggested that the core collapse process may be intrinsically strongly asymmetric. There is a tentative trend for supernova with smaller envelopes showing more polarization, with Type Ic having the smallest envelopes and showing the largest polarization. The recent discovery of the unusual supernova SN 1998bw and its apparent correlation with the gamma-ray burst GRB~980425 has raised new issues concerning both the gamma-ray bursts and supernovae. SN 1998bw resembled a Type Ic, but was unusually bright at maximum light in the optical and radio, and its expansion velocities were large. This makes SN 1998bw a possible candidate for a ""hypernova"" with explosion energies exceeding 1052 erg. We show that the light curve of SN 1998bw can be understood as the result of viewing an aspherical explosion roughly along the symmetry axis of an exploding, non-degenerate C/O core of a massive star with a kinetic energy of 2x1051 erg, a total ejecta mass of 2 solar masses, and a nickel-56 mass of 0.2 solar masses. In this model, the high expansion velocities are a direct consequence of the aspherical explosion which, in turn, produces oblate iso-density contours and that accounts for the polarization. It is not yet clear how either the hypernovae or these asymmetric models can produce gamma-ray bursts.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9906132,astro-ph,The X-ray selected BL Lac PKS 2155-304 has been observed using the University of Durham Mark 6 very high energy gamma ray telescope during 1998. We find no evidence for TeV emission during these recent observations when the X-ray flux was observed to be low. We have reconsidered our measurements made in 1997 November when PKS 2155-304 was in a bright X-ray state and extended X-ray and GeV gamma ray observations were made as part of a multiwavelength campaign. Comparisons are made of the VHE emission during this time with the available data from other wavelengths.,1999,[],5

We demonstrate that this long duration event exhibits strong parallax signatures. Additional information from the parallax effect allows us to determine the lens transverse velocity projected onto the Sun-source line to be ~145 km/s We also estimate the optical depth, event rate and duration distribution for microlensing toward Carina. We show that this event is broadly consistent with these predictions.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9903322,astro-ph,"The importance of Cepheids is well known in many fields of astronomy. Section 2 introduces the Fourier decomposition, a tool to describe quantitatively the light curves of pulsating stars. Sect. 3 shows how an observational result was progressively built on the basis of old and new data; the latter were collected on selected targets just to clarify some controversial points. Since different pulsation modes were suspected among Cepheids, an independent confirmation was searched for. To do that we applied the least-squares technique to Double Mode Cepheids. By obtaining a very satisfactory description of their pulsational content (Sect.4), we could confirm that between Cepheids with P<8d they are both fundamental and first overtone pulsators (Sect.5). The detection of small amplitude cross-coupling terms and higher harmonics in the light curves of Double Mode Cepheids allowed us to quantify the properties of the high-order terms and hence to discover other peculiarities (Sect.6), very useful to complete the scenario of the resonance effects and to test some theoretical models (Sect.7). Therefore, we can study the Cepheids from the point of view of asteroseismology since to find resonance effects is as to sound their interiors.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9902094,astro-ph,"This paper examines a new class of exact and self-consistent MHD solutions which describe steady and axisymmetric hydromagnetic outflows from the atmosphere of a magnetized and rotating central object with possibly an orbiting accretion disk. The plasma is driven against gravity by a thermal pressure gradient, as well as by magnetic rotator and radiative forces. At the Alfvenic and fast critical points the appropriate criticality conditions are applied. The outflow starts almost radially but after the Alfven transition and before the fast critical surface is encountered the magnetic pinching force bends the poloidal streamlines into a cylindrical jet-type shape. The terminal speed, Alfven number, cross-sectional area of the jet, as well as its final pressure and density obtain uniform values at large distances from the source. The goal of the study is to give an analytical discussion of the two-dimensional interplay of the thermal pressure gradient, gravitational, Lorentz and inertial forces in accelerating and collimating an MHD flow. A parametric study of the model is also given, as well as a brief sketch of its applicability to a self-consistent modelling of collimated outflows from various astrophysical objects. The analysed model succeeds to give for the first time an exact and self-consistent MHD solution for jet-type outflows extending from the stellar surface to infinity where it can be superfast, in agreement with the MHD causality principle.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9908222,astro-ph,"We present near-IR adaptive optics, VLA radio and HST optical imaging of the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC2992. Spiral structure and an extension to the West are traced down to the core region at the limiting resolution of our near-IR images. A faint, diffuse loop of near-IR and radio emission is also observed to the north, embedded within the prominent 2 arcsec radio loop previously observed to the northwest. Near-IR color maps, and CO narrowband imaging, are then used to identify which regions may not be purely reddened stellar populations. Our new data provide evidence that the VLA radio-loop morphology in the shape of a figure-8 represents two components superimposed: 1) outflow bubbles out of the plane of the disk, coincident with the extended emission line region (EELR); 2) star formation along the spiral arm within the galaxy disk and through the dust lane. The near-IR continuum emission associated with the outflowing radio bubbles suggest that the radio loops are driven by the active nucleus.",1999,[],5

Our estimate for the halo equation-ray flux turns out to be in remarkably good agreement with the discovery by Dixon et al. We also address future prospects to test our predictions.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9901251,astro-ph,"The color-magnitude diagrams of the open clusters NGC 2420 and NGC 2506 have been investigated as intermediate links between the solar neighborhood and the Magellanic Clouds. Two sets of theoretical isochrones which include convective overshoot are zeroed to the sun at solar abundance and to the unevolved main sequence dwarfs of the Hipparcos catalog at [Fe/H] = -0.4, requiring a differential of 0.4 mag between the unevolved main sequences at a given color. Adopting E(B-V) = 0.04 and [Fe/H] = -0.39 for NGC 2506 and 0.04 and -0.29 for NGC 2420,the respective apparent moduli are 12.70 and 12.15, while the ages of both clusters are approximately 1.9 /- 0.2 or 2.2 /- 0.2 Gyr, depending on the choice of isochrones. From the composite giant branch of the two clusters, the mean clump magnitudes in V and I are found to be 0.47 and -0.48 (-0.17,0.14). Applying a metallicity correction to the MI values, the cluster sample of Udalski (1998) leads to (m-M)0 = 18.42 (0.17,--0.15) and 18.91 (0.18,--0.16) for the LMC and SMC, respectively. A caveat to this discussion and to the claim that clusters of the same abundance and age are identical is the observation that the (V-I) colors of the red giants in NGC 2506 are significantly redder at a given (B-V) than the giants in clusters of comparable age and/or metallicity.

astro-ph/9905064,astro-ph,"We determine the parameters of scaling relations analogous to the Fundamental Plane of elliptical galaxies for the bulges and disks of a sample of 40 spiral galaxies. To this end we derive structural parameters (scalelengths and surface brightnesses) from near infrared H band images, and kinematical parameters (rotational velocities) from optical rotation curves. In the case of the disks, we test the accuracy of the derived relation as a distance indicator by comparing its scatter to that of the H band Tully-Fisher relation for the same sample, and find that the accuracy attained by the latter is slightly higher (the dispersion is 19% versus 23% for this sample). It is speculated that the difference is due to the more robust character of global parameters, rather than those associated with the inner parts of disks. It also apperas that (a) either the stellar mass-to-light ratios of bulge and disk increase with the size of the components, or (b) the bulge and disk relative contributions to the overall rotation of the galaxy (and, as a consequence, to its total mass) become steadily smaller with increasing size.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9907258,astro-ph,"EDITED FROM PAPER: We present mass models of the four-image gravitational lens system B1608656. A mass model for the lens galaxies has been determined that reproduces the image positions, two out of three flux-density ratios and the model time delays.   Using the time delays determined by Fassnacht et al. (1999a), we find that the best isothermal mass model gives H0=597-6 km/s/Mpc for Omegam=1 and Omegal=0.0, or H0=(65-63)7-6 km/s/Mpc for Omegam=0.3 and Omegal = 0.0-0.7 (95.4% statistical confidence). A systematic error of /-15 km/s/Mpc is estimated.   This cosmological determination of H0 agrees well with determinations from three other gravitational lens systems (i.e. B0218357, Q0957561 and PKS1830-211), SNe Ia, the S-Z effect and local determinations. The current agreement on H0 from four out of five gravitational lens systems (i) emphasizes the reliability of its determination from isolated gravitational lens systems and (ii) suggests that a close-to-isothermal mass profile can describe disk galaxies, ellipticals and central cluster ellipticals.   The average of H0 from B0218357, Q0957561, B1608656 and PKS1830-211, gives H0(GL)=69 /-7 km/s/Mpc for a flat universe with Omegam=1 or H0(GL)=74 /-8 km/s/Mpc for Omegam=0.3 and Omegal=0.0-0.7.

astro-ph/9911019,astro-ph,"We find in a detailed morphological study (at 15 pc resolution) that the extended massive star formation process, shows: (i) extended triple asymmetrical spiral arms structure (r = 5 kpc); and (ii) the spiral arms emanate from three different nuclei. The main optical nucleus shows a small spiral-disk (r = 500 pc) which is a continuation of the external one and reach the very nucleus. And this very nucleus shows blue elongate structure (63 pc x 30 pc), and luminous blue star cluster properties. We study the kinematics of this system and present a detailed Halpha velocity field for the central region (r = 5 kpc). In the main optical nucleus we found a clear ""outflow component"" associated to galactic-winds and a ""inflow radial motion"" (in the spiral-disk nuclear structure, r = 700 pc). In addition we detected the outflow component in the central and external regions (r < 5-6 kpc), with a very wide opening angle of 140. We found that the mean value of the inflow region (at PA = 80) is practically perpendicular to the axis of the bipolar outflow (at PA = 160). We analyze in detail the physical conditions in the giant H II regions located in the asymmetric spiral arms, the two main optical nuclei, and the outflow component. In the central region (r = 5-6 kpc) we detected that the nuclear starburst and the extended giant H II regions have very similar properties. We suggest that the interaction between dynamical effects, the galactic--wind (outflow), low-energy cosmic rays, and the molecularionized gas (probably in the inflow phase) could be the possible mechanism that generate the ""similar extended properties in the massive star formation, at scale of 5-6 kpc!"".

This analysis revealed that tracers of the old stellar population or the local interstellar medium provide only a poor description of the data. Tracers of the young stellar population considerably improve the fit. Residuals are minimized for the free-free emission map obtained by the DMR at microwave wavelengths and the 158 um fine-structure line map of C observed by FIRAS.

astro-ph/9906044,astro-ph,"Large patterns could exist on the microwave sky as a result of various non-standard possibilities for the large-scale Universe -- rotation or shear, non-trivial topology, and single topological defects are specific examples. All-sky (or nearly all-sky) CMB data sets allow us, uniquely, to constrain such exotica, and it is therefore worthwhile to explore a wide range of statistical tests. We describe one such statistic here, which is based on determining gradients and is useful for assessing the level of `preferred directionality' or `stripiness' in the map. This method is more general than other techniques for picking out specific patterns on the sky, and it also has the advantage of being easily calculable for the mega-pixel maps which will soon be available. For the purposes of illustration, we apply this statistic to the four-year COBE DMR data. For future CMB maps we expect this to be a useful statistical test of the large scale structure of the Universe. In principle, the same statistic could also be applied to sky maps at other wavelengths, to CMB polarisation maps, and to catalogues of discrete objects. It may also be useful as a means of checking for residual directionality (e.g., from Galactic or ecliptic signals) in maps.",1999,[],5

This sample is the largest equation selected catalogue of galaxies having equation calibrated fluxes so far. The results obtained from a preliminary analysis of a subsample of 66 galaxies show that the equation luminosity of galaxies is correlated with velocity dispersion and compactness of groups. Such correlations would point toward a scenario in which equation brightest galaxies reside in compact groups having higher probability of galaxy interaction i.e. lower values of velocity dispersion. Moreover such relations seem to depend on the environment in which HCGs themselves are embedded.,1999,[],5

Such an optical-UV flash can destroy dust in the beam by sublimation out to an appreciable distance, approximately 10 pc, and may clear the dust out of as much as 107(letterletter/4letter)Msun of molecular cloud material on an apparent time scale of 10 seconds. Detection of time dependent extinction on this time scale would therefore provide strong constraints on the GRB source environment. Dust destruction implies that existing, or future, observations of not-heavily-reddened fireballs are not inconsistent with GRBs being associated with star forming regions. In this case, however, if gamma-ray emission is highly beamed, the expanding fireball would become reddened on a 1 week time scale.

In gravitationally bound regions of a cloud, however, and at higher densities and resolution, the self-similar scaling relationships break down and it is possible to observe the first steps toward star formation.

As a confirmed permanent superhumper, the accretion disc of TV Col is naturally thermally stable. Therefore, our result supports the idea of Hellier and Buckley (1993) that the short-term outbursts seen in its light curve are mass transfer events rather than thermal instabilities in the disc.

astro-ph/9906271,astro-ph,"(Abridged) Numerical simulations indicate that the intergalactic medium (IGM) responsible for the low column density Lyman-alpha forest follows a well defined temperature-density relation.

This explains the existence of the lower envelope which is clearly seen in scatter plots of the b(N)-distribution in observed QSO spectra. We show that the parameters of the cutoff in the b(N)-distribution are strongly correlated with the parameters of the underlying equation of state. We use simulations to determine these relations, which can then be applied to the observed cutoff in the b(N)-distribution to measure the equation of state of the IGM. Using Monte Carlo simulations of Keck spectra at z=3, we show that determining the slope of the equation of state will be difficult, but that the amplitude can be determined to within ten per cent, even from a single QSO spectrum.

The survey is statistically complete to this magnitude limit. All galaxies have photometric structural parameters, including bulge fractions (B/T), from Hubble Space Telescope images, and spectroscopic redshifts from the Keck Telescope. The analysis includes a determination of the survey selection function in the magnitude-size plane as a function of redshift, which mainly drops faint galaxies at large distances. Our results suggest that selection effects play a very important role. A first analysis treats disk-dominated galaxies with B/T < 0.5. If selection effects are ignored, the mean disk surface brightness (averaged over all galaxies) increases by ~1.3 mag from z = 0.1 to 0.9. However, most of this change is plausibly due to comparing low luminosity galaxies in nearby redshift bins to high luminosity galaxies in distant bins. If this effect is allowed for, no discernible evolution remains in the disk surface brightness of bright (MB < -19) disk-dominated galaxies. A second analysis treats all galaxies by substituting half-light radius for disk scale length, with similar conclusions. Indeed, at all redshifts, the bulk of galaxies is consistent with the magnitude-size envelope of local galaxies, i.e., with little or no evolution in surface brightness. In the two highest redshift bins (z > 0.7), a handful of luminous, high surface brightness galaxies appears that occupies a region of the magnitude-size plane rarely populated by local galaxies.

In interpreting the CNO results for constraints on stellar evolution theories, careful attention has been paid to the comparison abundances, i.e., the present day abundances of SMC nebulae and B-dwarf stars. These new results are also compared to published results from F-K supergiant analyses, and found to be in good agreement when both sets of data are carefully examined as differential (SMC minus Galactic standard) abundances.   With the exception of nitrogen, very small star-to-star abundance variations are found for all elements in this analysis. The N variations are not predicted by standard stellar evolution models. Instead, the results support the new predictions reported from rotating stellar models, where the range in nitrogen is the result of partial mixing of CN-cycled gas from the stellar interior due to main-sequence rotation at different rates (c.f., Langer & Heger 1998). The overall overabundance of nitrogen in the sampled stars also implies these stars have undergone the first dredge-up in addition to having been mixed while on the main-sequence.   The alpha-elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) have similar underabundances to Fe, which is not the same as seen in metal-poor stars in the solar neighborhood of the Galaxy.

Lower mass companions open gaps, but migration continues because sufficient disk mass remains close to the disk to exert large tidal torques. We find that the torques which dominate the migration of low mass planets originate within a radial region within 1-2 Hill radii of the planet's orbit radius, a distance smaller than the thickness of the disk.

The line bisectors of the most metal-poor star, the subgiant HD140283, show a significantly larger velocity span that the expectations for a solar-metallicity star of the same spectral type and luminosity class. The enhanced line asymmetries are interpreted as the signature of the lower metal content, and therefore opacity, in the convective photospheric patterns. These findings point out the importance of three-dimensional convective velocity fields in the interpretation of the observed line asymmetries in metal-poor stars, and in particular, urge for caution when deriving isotopic ratios from observed line shapes and shifts using one-dimensional model atmospheres.   The mean line bisector of the photospheric atomic lines is compared with those measured for the strong Mg I b1 and b2 features. The upper part of the bisectors are similar, and assuming they overlap, the bottom end of the stronger lines, which are formed higher in the atmosphere, goes much further to the red.

Using a K-S test comparison with the observational Log equation - Log equation, we find constraints on the GRB fireball model, GRB jets, and the possible GRB contribution to cosmic gamma-ray background. We find the acceptable dynamic range for equation.Our results show that jet model is more likely to be related more highly energetic explosion than fireball model.Our studies also show that the luminosity function provided by a purely special relativistic effect on a jet is outside of the K-S test acceptable range. Were intrinsic beaming to confine the jet to equation however, the effects of relativistic beaming would not dominate.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9908118,astro-ph,"Predictions from a Galactic Structure and Kinematic model are compared to the absolute proper-motions of about 30,000 randomly selected stars with equation derived from the Southern Proper-Motion Program (SPM) toward the South Galactic Pole. The absolute nature of the SPM proper-motions allow us to measure not only the relative motion of the Sun with respect to the local disk, but also, and most importantly, the overall state of rotation of the local disk with respect to galaxies. The SPM data are best fit by models having a solar peculiar motion of 5 km~sequation in the V-component (pointing in the direction of Galactic rotation), a large LSR speed of 270 km~sequation, and a disk velocity ellipsoid that points towards the Galactic center. We stress, however, that these results rest crucially on the assumptions of both axisymmetry and equilibrium dynamics.   The absolute proper-motions in the U-component indicate a solar peculiar motion of equation km~sequation, with no need for a local expansion or contraction term.   The implications of the large LSR speed are discussed in terms of gravitational mass of the Galaxy inferred from the most recent and accurate determination for the proper-motion of the LMC. We find that our derived value for the LSR is consistent both with the mass of the Galaxy inferred from the motion of the Clouds (equation to equation kpc), as well as the timing argument, based on the binary motion of M31 and the Milky Way, and Leo I and the Milky Way (equation to equation kpc).",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9910249,astro-ph,"We present results from a morphological study of the distant X-ray cluster MS1054-03 at z=0.83. We have obtained a large, two color HST WFPC2 mosaic of this cluster, and measured redshifts of 186 galaxies in the MS1054-03 field with the 10m Keck telescope. Of 81 spectroscopically confirmed cluster galaxies observerd with HST, 13 are merger systems. Most of these mergers will likely evolve into luminous elliptical galaxies, and some may evolve into S0 galaxies. If the galaxy population in MS1054-03 is typical for its redshift up to 50% of ellipticals may have formed in mergers at z<1. The mergers are generally red and have no detected OII 3727 emission. This result is consistent with the old stellar ages of ellipticals inferred from other studies. The mergers are preferentially found towards the outskirts of the cluster, indicating they probably occur in infalling clumps. A significant overabundance of close pairs of red galaxies detected in the outskirts of MS1054-03 confirms the large number of interacting galaxies in this cluster.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9906048,astro-ph,"Proper motions and radial velocities of luminous infrared stars in the galactic center have provided strong evidence for a dark mass of 2.5 million solar masses in the central 0.05 pc of the galaxy. The leading hypothesis for this mass is a black hole. High angular resolution measurements at radio wavelengths find a compact radio source, Sagittarius (Sgr) A*, that is either the faint glow from a small amount of material accreting onto the hole with low radiative efficiency or a miniature AGN core-jet system.   We provide in this paper a full report on the first program that has measured the apparent proper motion of Sgr A* with respect to background extragalactic reference frame. Our current result is: mul,*=[-6.18/-0.19] mas/y and mub,*=[-0.65/-0.17] mas/y. The observations were obtained with the NRAO Very Large Array at 4.9 GHz over sixteen years. The proper motion of Sgr A* provides an estimate of its mass based on equipartition of kinetic energy between the hole and the surrounding stars. The measured motion is largest in galactic longitude. This component of the motion is consistent with the secular parallax that results from the rotation of the solar system about the center, which is a global measure of Oort's constants (A-B), with no additional peculiar motion of Sgr A*. The current uncertainty in Oort's galactic rotation constants limits the use of this component of the proper motion for a mass inference. In latitude we find a small, and weakly significant, peculiar motion of Sgr A*, -19/-7 km/s after correction for the motion of the solar system with respect to the local standard of rest.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9911288,astro-ph,"If weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) in bound solar orbits are systematically driven into the Sun by solar-system resonances (as Farinella et al. have shown is the case for many Earth-crossing asteroids), then the capture of high-mass WIMPs by the Earth would be affected dramatically because high-mass WIMPs are captured primarily from bound orbits. WIMP capture would be eliminated for Mx>630 GeV and would be highly suppressed for Mx>~150 GeV. Annihilation of captured WIMPs and anti-WIMPs is expected to give rise to neutrinos coming from the Earth's center. The absence of such a neutrino signal has been used to place limits on WIMP parameters. At present, one does not know if typical WIMP orbits are in fact affected by these resonances. Until this question is investigated and resolved, one must (conservatively) assume that they are. Hence, limits on high-mass WIMP parameters are significantly weaker than previously believed.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9901038,astro-ph,"We present photoionization models of the optical and IR coronal line spectrum in NGC1068 and the Circinus galaxy. The line fluxes have been calculated using (a) a non-thermal (nuclear) continuum source and (b) the non-thermal continuum plus a UV bump due to a stellar cluster. We take into account the effect of attenuation of these continua by gas with column density equation located between the nucleus and the coronal line region. The calculated coronal line ratios are in a good agreement with those observed in NGC1068 for a model in which about 40% of the line emission comes from gas illuminated by unattenuated, non-thermal continuum, and about 60% from gas illuminated by attenuated, non-thermal continuum. The electron density of the coronal line emitting gas in NGC1068 is found to be equation. In the Circinus galaxy the coronal line emission comes from gas with electron density equation illuminated entirely by attenuated, non-thermal continuum. The derived ionization parameters for both coronal line regions are very similar, but the different densities imply a higher ionizing photon flux in NGC1068, consistent with the higher observed excitation state of the line emitting gas in that galaxy. A possible geometry of the coronal line region of both galaxies is discussed, in which the distribution of the attenuating gas may be strongly affected by the relative strength of the nuclear radio-jet. The stronger radio-jet in NGC1068 may have cleared a channel through the NLR allowing some unattenuated nuclear continuum to illuminate part of the coronal line region.",1999,[],5

Attempts to include some of those phenomena in the Standard Cosmological Model also encounter serious difficulties. In the present paper an alternative cosmological concept is discussed. There are several features in it. First of all, the whole Universe (Grand Universe) is a multitude of typical universes, like ours, evenly made of either matter or antimatter, hence, there is no violation of the baryon symmetry on the largest scale.   Second, high-energy phenomena are the result of matter-antimatter annihilation processes in a typical universe evolution.

We show that in the case of the Sun, interstellar dust grains can produce large regions of infrared emission that can be confused with a circumsolar dust disk when observed from afar.

astro-ph/9905381,astro-ph,Spectroscopy of ten quasars obtained with the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is presented. A clustering analysis reveals an excess of nearest neighbor line pairs on velocity scales of 250-750 km/s at a 95-98% confidence level. The hypothesis that the absorbers are randomly distributed in velocity space can be ruled out at the 99.8% confidence level. No two-point correlation power is detected (xi < 1 with 95% confidence). Lyman-alpha absorbers have correlation amplitudes on scales of 250-500 km/s at least 4-5 times smaller than the correlation amplitude of bright galaxies. A detailed comparison between absorbers in nearby galaxies is carried out on a limited subset of 11 Lyman- alpha absorbers where the galaxy sample in a large contiguous volume is complete to MB = -16. Absorbers lie preferentially in regions of intermediate galaxy density but it is often not possible to uniquely assign a galaxy counterpart to an absorber. This sample provides no explicit support for the hypothesis that absorbers are preferentially associated with the halos of luminous galaxies. We have made a preliminary comparison of the absorption line properties and environments with the results of hydrodynamic simulations. The results suggest that the Lyman-alpha absorbers represent diffuse or shocked gas in the IGM that traces the cosmic web of large scale structure. (abridged),1999,[],5

The intermediate part of the jet is almost current-free and is magnetically dominated. Most of the momentum is located around the axis in the dense core and this region is likely to dominate the dynamics of the jet.

After the end of the mass transfer phase, SMNSs will loose through magnetic dipole radiation most of their angular momentum, triggering the star's collapse to a black hole.

The latter two are included by allowing for locally adiabatic, non-isentropic pressure components. Such models are meant to represent, in a schematic manner, the velocity and density structure of cores and globules, as inferred from molecular line and dust continuum observations. We show by explicit construction that it is possible to have dense cores comparable to the Jeans mass embedded in stable clouds of much larger mass. In a subsequent paper, we show that composite polytropes on the verge of gravitational instability can reproduce the observed velocity and density structure of cores and globules under a variety of physical conditions.",1999,[],5

We consider the detectability of isolated stellar mass black holes accreting from the ISM, and show that for any rapidly rotating holes the efficiency of energy extraction could reach 0.01. The estimated total luminosity would be consistent with the tentative identification of some EGRET sources as accreting isolated black holes, if that energy is radiated primarily as gamma rays.

Qualitatively, all the models share the same properties of the nonradial modes. At the quantitative level, the properties are to a large extent determined by the radial mode periods. There is only weak dependence on the star metallicity and no apparent dependence on the evolutionary status, that is on the helium exhaustion in the convective core.   In the whole range of RRab and RRc star parameters we find unstable nonradial modes driven by the opacity mechanism.

astro-ph/9908121,astro-ph,"To quantify the effect that bar driven mass inflow can have on the evolution of a galaxy requires an understanding of the dynamics of the inflowing gas. In this paper we study the kinematics of the dense molecular gas in a set of seven barred spiral galaxies to determine which dynamical effects dominate. The kinematics are derived from observations of the CO J=(1-0) line made with the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA) millimeter array. We compare the observed kinematics to those predicted by ideal gas hydrodynamic and ballistic cloud-based models of gas flow in a barred potential. The hydrodynamic model is in good qualitative agreement with both the current observations of the dense gas and previous observations of the kinematics of the ionized gas. The observed kinematics indicate that the gas abruptly changes direction upon entering the dust lanes to flow directly down the dust lanes along the leading edge of the bar until the dust lanes approach the nuclear ring. Near the location where the dust lanes intersect the nuclear ring, we see two velocity components: a low velocity component, corresponding to gas on circular orbits, and a higher velocity component, which can be attributed to the fraction of gas flowing down the bar dust lane which sprays past the contact point toward the other half of the bar. The ballistic cloud-based model of the ISM is not consistent with the observed kinematics. The kinematics in the dust lanes require large velocity gradients which cannot be reproduced by an ISM composed of ballistic clouds with long mean-free-paths. Therefore, even the dense ISM responds to hydrodynamic forces.",1999,[],5

We find good agreement with previous results obtained by other methods regarding several important features of the evolution, including the pre-collapse distribution of heavier stars, the time scale on which equipartition is approached, and the extent to which core collapse is accelerated by a small subpopulation of heavier stars.

The observed Ly-alpha forest systems have a mean redshift of z=2.7. There is marginal evidence of clustering along the line of sight over the velocity range 100 < v < 250 km/s. The 1-point and 2-point joint probability distributions of the transmitted flux for the Ly-alpha forest were calculated, and shown to be very insensitive to the heavy element contamination. We could find no evidence of Voigt profile departures due to infalling gas, as observed in the simulated forest spectra. Twelve heavy-element absorption systems were identified, including damped Lyman-alpha systems at z=2.62 and 2.91.

astro-ph/9912196,astro-ph,"Galaxy evolution during the last 9 Gyr is discussed. It can be traced back from well known present-day galaxies or directly observed for galaxies at different look back times. This requires clear and consistently matched selection criteria for galaxy samples. There is a net decrease of rest-frame, UV luminosity density, at least since z = 1. It is interpreted as an important decline of the star formation since the last ~9 Gyr. A similar trend is found for the evolution of the IR luminosity density which accounts for heavily extincted starbursts. Interestingly the global star formation density, after including IR selected galaxies, is twice the value of estimates based on the UV luminosity density, and this holds from z=0 to z=1.   Large disks are not contributing much to the observed decrease, which is mainly related to significant changes with the epoch in the distribution of galaxy morphologies.

astro-ph/9904223,astro-ph,"Quasar (or QSO) elemental abundances provide unique probes of high-redshift star formation and galaxy evolution. There is growing evidence from both the emission and intrinsic absorption lines that QSO environments have roughly solar or higher metallicities out to redshifts >4. The range is not well known, but solar to a few times solar appears to be typical. There is also evidence for higher metallicities in more luminous objects, and for generally enhanced N/C and Fe/alpha abundances compared to solar ratios.   These results identify QSOs with vigorous, high-redshift star formation -- consistent with the early evolution of massive galactic nuclei or dense proto-galactic clumps. However, the QSOs offer new constraints. For example, 1) most of the enrichment and star formation must occur before the QSOs ""turn on"" or become observable, on time scales of ~<1 Gyr at least at the highest redshifts. 2) The tentative result for enhanced Fe/alpha suggests that the first local star formation began at least ~1 Gyr prior to the QSO epoch. 3) The star formation must ultimately be extensive in order to reach high metallicities, i.e. a substantial fraction of the local gas must be converted into stars and stellar remnants. The exact fraction depends on the shape of the initial mass function (IMF). 4) The highest derived metallicities require IMFs that are weighted slightly more toward massive stars than the in solar neighborhood. 5) High metallicities also require deep gravitational potentials. By analogy with the well-known mass--metallicity relation among low-redshift galaxies, metal-rich QSOs should reside in galaxies (or proto-galaxies) that are minimally as massive (or as tightly bound) as our own Milky Way.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9908048,astro-ph,"Here we present new optical data from the Hubble Space Telescope of the NGC 253 central region, which reveal numerous discrete sources in a ring--like structure. This is combined with data at infrared, millimeter, radio and X-ray wavelengths to examine the nature of these discrete sources and the nucleus itself. We find that the majority of optical/IR/mm sources are young star clusters which trace out a ~50 pc ring, that defines the inner edge of a cold gas torus. This reservoir of cold gas has probably been created by gas inflow from a larger scale bar and deposited at the inner Lindblad resonance. The family of compact radio sources lie interior to the starburst ring, and in general do not have optical or IR counterparts. They are mostly SNRs. The radio nucleus, which is probably an AGN, lies near the centre of the ring. The X-ray emission from the nuclear source is extended in the ROSAT HRI detector indicating that not all of the X-ray emission can be associated with the AGN. The lack of X-ray variability and the flat radio spectrum of the nucleus, argues against an ultraluminous SN as the dominant energetic source at the galaxy core. The diffuse emission associated with the outflowing superwind is present in the central region on a size scale consistent with the idea of collimation by the gas torus.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9903071,astro-ph,"Observations of the stellar content of the Milky Way's bulge helps to understand the stellar content and evolution of distant galaxies. In this brief overview I will first highlight some recent work directed towards measuring the history of star formation and the chemical composition of the central few parsecs of the Galaxy. High resolution spectroscopic observations by Ramrez et al. (1998) of luminous M stars in this region yield a near solar value for [Fe/H] from direct measurements of iron lines. Then I will present some results from an ongoing program by my colleagues and myself which has the objective of delineating the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of the central 100 parsecs of the Galaxy, the 'inner bulge'. We have found a small increase in mean [Fe/H] from Baade's Window to the Galactic Center and deduce a near solar value for stars at the center. For radial distances greater than one degree we fail to find a measurable population of stars that are significantly younger than those in Baade's Window. Within one degree of the Galactic Center we find a number of luminous M giants that most likely are the result of a star formation episode not more than one or two Gyr ago.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9907264,astro-ph,"We present B-, V-, Rc-, Ic-, J-, H-, K- and K'-band observations of the optical transient (OT) associated with GRB970228, based on a reanalysis of previously used images and unpublished data. In order to minimize calibration differences we have collected and analyzed most of the photometry and consistently determined the magnitude of the OT relative to a set of secondary field stars. We confirm our earlier finding that the early decay of the light curves (before March 6, 1997) was faster than that at intermediate times (between March 6 and April 7, 1997). At late times the light curves resume a fast decay (after April 7, 1997). The early-time observations of GRB970228 are consistent with relativistic blast-wave models but the intermediate- and late-time observations are hard to understand in this framework. The observations are well explained by an initial power law decay with index -1.73 0.09 -0.12 modified at later times by a type-Ic supernova light curve. Together with the evidence for GRB980326 and GRB980425 this gives further support for the idea that at least some GRBs are associated with a possibly rare type of supernova.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9906493,astro-ph,"We incorporate a simple scheme for the growth of supermassive black holes into semi-analytic models that follow the formation and evolution of galaxies in a cold dark matter dominated Universe. We assume that supermassive black holes are formed and fuelled during major mergers. If two galaxies of comparable mass merge, their central black holes coalesce and a few percent of the gas in the merger remnant is accreted by the new black hole over a timescale of a few times 107 years. With these simple assumptions, our model not only fits many aspects of the observed evolution of galaxies, but also reproduces quantitatively the observed relation between bulge luminosity and black hole mass in nearby galaxies, the strong evolution of the quasar population with redshift and the relation between the luminosities of nearby quasars and those of their host galaxies. The strong decline in the number density of quasars from z=2 to z=0 is due to the combination of three effects: i) a decrease in the merging rate, ii) a decrease in the amount of cold gas available to fuel black holes, and iii) an increase in the timescale for gas accretion. In a LCDM cosmology the predicted decline in the total content of cold gas in galaxies is consistent with that inferred from observations of damped Lyman-alpha systems. Our results strongly suggest that the evolution of supermassive black holes, quasars and starbursts is inextricably linked to the hierarchical build-up of galaxies.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9912017,astro-ph,"We present new, NTT longslit spectroscopy of the B[e] supergiant in the binary system R4 in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The data show extended, forbidden N and S emissions which are typical signatures of circumstellar matter. Their extension along the space axis of the slit defines an angular size of 8.6' which translates into a linear size of 2.4 pc. The N emission lines also show the velocity structure of a bipolar outflow expanding at 100 km/s on average. This implies that, for a measured radius of 1.2 pc, the outflow originated about 12000 yrs ago. The line flux ratio [NII]6584/[SII]6717 indicates that the nebula is nitrogen enriched and therefore it has been ejected from the central star. This is the first bipolar, ejection nebula detected around a well-established B[e] supergiant. The bipolar morphology and the chemical enrichment shown by the nebula associated with R4 are consistent with the picture of a binary merger (Langer & Heger 1998), in which R4 was originally a system composed by a close pair and a third star (the observed A companion). The close pair merged into a single star and the merging process produced a circumstellar nebula that was later shaped by the ensueing B star wind.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9907289,astro-ph,We compute the mass loss rate from a disk orbiting a stellar mass black hole assuming the flow is guided along magnetic field lines attached to the disk. We then estimate the Lorentz factor of the wind at infinity. We find that the Lorentz factor can reach high values only if severe constraints on the field geometry and the conditions of energy injection are satisfied. We discuss our results in the context of different scenarios for gamma-ray bursts. We mention a risk of 'contamination' of the Blandford-Znajek process by wind material emitted from the disk.,1999,[],5
astro-ph/9906343,astro-ph,We present a model for the compression and heating of the ICM by powerful radio galaxies and quasars. Based on a self-similar model of the dynamical evolution of FRII-type objects we numerically integrate the hydrodynamic equations governing the flow of the shocked ICM in between the bow shock and the radio lobes of these sources. The resulting gas properties are presented and discussed. The X-ray emission of the shocked gas is calculated and is found to be in agreement with observations. The enhancement of the X-ray emission of cluster gas due to the presence of powerful radio galaxies may play an important role in the direct detection of cluster gas at high redshifts.,1999,[],5
astro-ph/9904289,astro-ph,"We solve the quasiclassical problem of tunneling through an external potential barrier in a dense plasma, where the tunneling particles undergo simultaneous collisions with other particles in thermodynamic equilibrium. Under such conditions the spectral density of states available to the particle has a Lorentz shape, rather than the delta function, which leads to a quantum tail in the particle momentum distribution function. We show that, this tail indeed significantly alters the average nuclear reaction rates, which supports earlier suggestions. This rate can be many orders of magnitude higher than would be normally calculated by averaging over the Maxwell distribution of energies.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9903235,astro-ph,"We identify a new mechanism of internal dissipation of rotational kinetic energy in spinning dust grains, arising from the reorientation of nuclear angular momentum, e.g., spins of protons. Grain rotation induces magnetization of the nuclear spin system, with net alignment of nuclear spins parallel to the grain angular velocity. When the grain does not rotate around a principal axis, the nuclear magnetization vector precesses in grain body coordinates, resulting in dissipation of energy. The analogous process involving electron spins was discovered by Purcell and termed 'Barnett relaxation'. We revisit the physics of the 'Barnett relaxation' process and correct the estimate for the Barnett relaxation rate. We show that nuclear relaxation can be orders of magnitude more important than Barnett relaxation. This finding implies that the processes of 'thermal flipping' and 'thermal trapping' are important for a broad range of grain sizes.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9912118,astro-ph,"The characteristics of black-hole X-ray binaries can be used to obtain information about their evolutionary history and the process of black-hole formation. In this paper I focus on systems with donor masses lower than the inferred black-hole masses. Current models for the evolution of hydrogen-rich, massive stars and of helium stars losing mass in a wind cannot explain the current sample of black-hole mass measurements. Assuming that the radial evolution of mass-losing massive stars is at least qualitatively accurate, I show that the properties of the BH companions lead to constraints on the masses of black-hole progenitors (at most twice the black-hole mass) and on the strength of winds in helium stars (fractional amount of mass lost smaller than about 50%). Constraints on common-envelope evolution are also derived.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9907370,astro-ph,"A survey of the inner 8equation of the Galactic plane toward the Galactic center has been carried out at the 1720 MHz transition of OH molecule using the VLA in its D configuration with a resolution of equation. The detection of compact 1720 MHz OH masers associated with three supernova remnants G357.70.3, G1.13--0.1 (Sgr D) and G1.4--0.1 as well as new extended maser line emission from G357.70.3 and G357.7--0.1 (the Tornado Nebula) were then followed up by A-array observations with spectral and spatial resolutions of 0.3 \kms and equation, respectively.   The 1720 MHz OH maser line emission is considered to be a powerful shock diagnostic and is collisionally pumped by Hequation molecules at the site where C-type supernova shocks drive into adjacent molecular clouds. The new observations show clear evidence of extended features coincident with compact and bright masers, the best example of which is a coherent feature over a scale of about 20 pc surrounding the shell of the SNR G357.70.3. We argue that this remarkable feature is an OH maser and is physically associated with the remnant. This implies that the ambient molecular cloud is uniform in its density and temperature with restricted range of pumping conditions and survives the passage of a large-scale shock front.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9910151,astro-ph,"The evolution of the 7Li abundance in the Galaxy has been computed by taking into account several 7Li sources: novae, massive AGB stars, C-stars, Type II SNe and GCRs. The theoretical predictions for the evolution of the 7Li abundance in the solar neighborhood have been compared to a new compilation of data. A critical analysis of extant observations revealed a possible extension of the Li plateau towards higher metallicities (up to [Fe/H] = -0.5 or even -0.3) with a steep rise afterwards. We conclude that 1) the 7Li contribution from novae is required in order to reproduce the shape of the growth of A(Li) versus [Fe/H], 2) the contribution from Type II SNe should be lowered by at least a factor of two, and 3) the 7Li production from GCRs is probably more important than previously estimated, in particular at the highest metallicities.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9909212,astro-ph,"Second order perturbation theory predicts a specific dependence of the bispectrum, or three-point correlation function in the Fourier transform domain, on the shape of the configuration of its three wave vector arguments, which can be taken as a signature of structure formed by gravitational instability. Comparing this known dependence on configuration shape with the weak shape dependence of the galaxy bispectrum has been suggested as an indication of bias in the galaxy distribution. However, to interpret results obtained from projected catalogs, we must first understand the effects of projection on this shape dependence. We present expressions for the projected power spectrum and bispectrum in both Cartesian and spherical geometries, and we examine the effects of projection on the predicted bispectrum with particular attention to the dependence on configuration shape. Except for an overall numerical factor, for Cartesian projection with characteristic depth equation there is little effect on the shape dependence of the bispectrum for wavelengths small compared to equation or projected wavenumbers equation. For angular projection, a scaling law is found for spherical harmonic index equation, but there is always a mixing of scales over the range of the selection function. For large equation it is sufficient to examine a small portion of the sky.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9909039,astro-ph,Results of a 1999 July 8-10 BeppoSAX observation during an anomalous low-state of Her X-1 are presented. The standard on-state power-law and blackbody continuum model is excluded at high confidence unless partial covering is included. This gives a power-law photon index of 0.63 /- 0.02 and implies that 0.28 /- 0.03 of the flux undergoes additional absorption of (27 /- 7) 1022 atom/cm2. 11% of the observed 0.1-10 keV flux is from the 0.068 /- 0.015 keV blackbody. 1.237747(2) s pulses with a semi-amplitude of 2.1 /- 0.8% are detected at >99.5% confidence and confirmed by RXTE measurements. This implies that Her X-1 underwent substantial spin-down close to the start of the anomalous low-state. The spectral and temporal changes are similar to those recently reported from 4U1626-67. These may result from a strongly warped disk that produces a spin-down torque. The X-ray source is then mostly viewed through the inner regions of the accretion disk. A similar mechanism could be responsible for the Her X-1 anomalous low-states. Shadowing by such an unusually warped disk could produce observable effects in the optical and UV emission from the companion star.,1999,[],5

Finally, the question of when one might consider the search for Population III Finished is addressed.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9911042,astro-ph,"We report on Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations of four type I X-ray bursters; namely 1E1724-3045, GS1826-238, SLX1735-269 and KS1731-260. The first three were in a low state (LS) whereas KS1731-260 was in a high state. The LS sources have very similar power spectra, displaying high frequency noise up to \~200 Hz. For KS1731-260, its power spectrum is dominated by noise at frequencies below 20 Hz. In addition a quasi-periodic oscillation at 1200 Hz is detected. The 1-200 keV LS spectra are all consistent with resulting from thermal Comptonization with an electron temperature (kTe) around 25-30 keV. For KS1731-260, the spectrum is also dominated by Comptonization, but with kTe around 3 keV and no significant hard X-ray emission. With the exception of GS1826-238, there is an underlying soft component. For all sources, we have detected an iron line at 6.4 keV. A reflection component is present in the spectra of GS1826-238 and SLX1735-269. We suggest a model in which the region of main energy release, where hard X-rays are produced would be an optically thin boundary layer merged with an Advection Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF). The soft component observed probably represents the unscattered emission from the accretion disk of variable inner radius. When the accretion rate increases, the inner disk radius shrinks, the strength of the reflected component and associated iron line increase, and the Comptonization region cools off in response to an increased cooling flux from the accretion disk and from the reprocessed/reflected component. Finally, in the light of these observations, we discuss extensively the various criteria recently proposed to distinguish between non-quiescent accreting black holes and neutron stars.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9906053,astro-ph,"We discuss the metallicity effect on the theoretical visual and near-infrared PL and PLC relations of classical Cepheids, as based on nonlinear, nonlocal and time--dependent convective pulsating models at varying chemical composition. In view of the two usual methods of averaging (magnitude-weighted and intensity-weighted) observed magnitudes and colors over the full pulsation cycle, we briefly discuss the differences between static and mean quantities. We show that the behavior of the synthetic mean magnitudes and colors fully reproduces the observed trend of Galactic Cepheids, supporting the validity of the model predictions. In the second part of the paper we show how the estimate of the mean reddening and true distance modulus of a galaxy from Cepheid VK photometry depend on the adopted metal content, in the sense that larger metallicities drive the host galaxy to lower extinctions and distances. Conversely, self-consistent estimates of the Cepheid mean reddening, distance and metallicity may be derived if three-filter data are taken into account. By applying the theoretical PL and PLC relations to available BVK data of Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds we eventually obtain Z \sim 0.008, E(B-V) \sim 0.02 mag, DM \sim 18.63 mag for LMC and Z \sim 0.004, E(B-V) \sim 0.01 mag., DM \sim 19.16 mag. for SMC. The discrepancy between such reddenings and the current values based on BVI data is briefly discussed.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9909424,astro-ph,"The typical product of the star formation process is a binary star. Binaries have provided the first dynamical measures of the masses of pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars, providing support for the calibrations of PMS evolutionary tracks. Surprisingly, in some star-forming regions PMS binary frequencies are higher than among main-sequence solar-type stars. The difference in PMS and main-sequence binary frequencies is apparently not an evolutionary effect; recent attention has focussed on correlations between binary frequency and stellar density or cloud temperatures. Accretion disks are common among young binary stars. Binaries with separations between 1 AU and 100 AU have substantially less submillimeter emission than closer or wider binaries, suggesting that they have truncated their disks. Evidence of dynamical clearing has been seen in several binaries. Remarkably, PMS binaries of all separations show evidence of circumstellar disks and continued accretion. This suggests that the circumstellar disks are replenished from circumbinary disks or envelopes. The frequent presence of disks suggests that planet formation can occur in binary environments, and formation of planets in wide binaries is already established by their discovery. Circumbinary disk masses around very short period binaries are ample to form planetary systems such as our own. The nature of planetary systems among the most common binaries, with separations between 10 AU and 100 AU, is less clear given the observed reduction in disk mass, though they may have disk masses adequate for the formation of terrestrial-like planets.",1999,[],5

As an illustration of the method, the predicted IRAS peculiar velocity model is herein tested using the fluxes of the IRAS 1.2 Jy sample as the distance indicator.

astro-ph/9902076,astro-ph,"The most energetic part of the electromagnetic spectrum bears the purest clues to the synthesis of atomic nuclei in the universe. The decay of radioactive species, synthesized in stellar environments and ejected into the interstellar medium, gives rise to specific gamma ray lines. The observations gathered up to now show evidence for radioactivities throughout the galactic disk, in young supernova remnants (Cas A, Vela), and in nearby extragalactic supernovae (SN 1987A, SN 1991T and SN1998bu), in the form of specific gamma ray lines resulting, respectively, from the radioactive decay of 26Al, 44Ti and 56Co. The various astrophysical sites of thermal nucleosynthesis of the radioactive nuclei were discussed: AGB and Wolf-Rayet stars, novae, and type Ia and type II supernovae. Nuclear excitations by fast particles also produce gamma ray lines which have been observed in great detail from solar flares, and more hypothetically from active star forming regions where massive supernovae and WR stars abound. This non thermal process and its nucleosynthetic consequences was reviewed. The 511 keV line arising from e  e- annihilation also provides important information on explosive nucleosynthesis, as well as on the nature of the interstellar medium where the positrons annihilate.

Together with the previously discovered Martian satellite 5261 Eureka, these are the only known possible solar system Trojan asteroids not associated with Jupiter. Here, maps of the locations of the stable Trojan trajectories of Mars are presented. These are constructed by integrating an ensemble of in-plane and inclined orbits in the vicinity of the Martian Lagrange points for between 25 million and 60 million years. The survivors occupy a band of inclinations between 15 degrees and 40 degrees and longitudes between 240 degrees and 330 degrees at the L5 Lagrange point. Around the L4 point, stable Trojans inhabit two bands of inclinations (15 degrees < i < 30 degrees and 32 degrees < i < 40 degrees) with longitudes restricted between 25 degrees and 120 degrees. Both 5261 Eureka and 1998 VF31 lie deep within one of the stable zones, which suggests they may be of primordial origin. Around Mars, the number of such undiscovered primordial objects with sizes greater than 1 km may be as high as 50.

In fact the ULIRGs at high redshift are producing a significant fraction (>= 15%) of the total luminous output of the Universe averaged over all wavelengths and all epochs. The high z ULIRGs could plausibly be responsible for producing the metal-rich spheroidal components of galaxies, including the bulges that are the subject of this conference.

The objects were observed for 7 years at the Wise Observatory, as part of a long term effort to monitor AGN of various types. This is the most extensive program of its kind carried out to date on a well-defined optically selected quasar sample. The typical sampling interval is ~40 days. One third of the quasars were observed at ~60 epochs and the rest at ~30 epochs in two bands (B&R) with photometric accuracy of ~0.01 mag. We present lightcurves for all of the sources and discuss the sample variability properties. All of the quasars in the sample varied during the campaign with intrinsic rms amplitudes of 5%<sigmaB<34% and 4%<sigmaR<26%. The rms amplitude and colour for the entire sample are sigmaB=14%, sigmaR=12%, and sigmaB-R=5%. On time scales of 100- 1000 days the power spectra of the sources have a power-law shape with index approximately 2.0 and a spread <0.6. At least half of the quasars, particularly those that are most variable, become bluer when they brighten, and the rest do not show this behaviour. We quantify this phenomenon, which has been observed previously mainly in Seyfert galaxies. The quasars which are most variable tend also to exhibit asymmetry in their variations, in the sense that the brightening phases last longer than the fading phases. We have searched for correlations between the measured variability properties and other parameters of the quasars, such as luminosity, redshift, radio loudness, and X-ray slope.

On the other hand `blank field' imaging in the sub-mm seems to turn up sources routinely, amongst which some are star forming galaxies at similar redshifts. Already much work has been done searching for optical identifications of objects detected using the SCUBA instrument. Here we have taken the opposite approach, performing sub-mm photometry for a sample of Lyman break galaxies whose UV properties imply high star formation rates.   The total signal from our Lyman break sample is undetected in the sub-mm, at an RMS level of 0.5 mJy, which implies that the population of Lyman break galaxies does not constitute a large part of the recently detected blank-field sub-mm sources.

We spectroscopically detected a significant fraction of lithium-rich pre-main sequence (PMS) objects including even M-type stars. In an area located about 20 deg south of the Tau-Aur star formation region (SFR) and close to the Gould Belt, we found a large fraction of 40% PMS stars among the K-type stellar counterparts. In other areas we found a smaller but still significant fraction of Li-rich stars. We compared the log N - log S distribution with published galactic distribution models for different age groups and with results from the ROSAT Galactic Plane Survey. For the sample south of Tau-Aur we find an excess of PMS stars compared to model calculations while in the other areas the observed log N - log S is close to the model predictions. We started to investigate the proper motions and radial velocities of both, the young lithium-rich and the older stellar counterparts.

The M/L ratio and, therefore, the dark mass fraction (DMF) is not constant at all, but varies within the bulge, increases already within the disk, and rapidly from the disk toward halo. In some galaxies, the DMF within the bulge increases inward toward the center, indicating a massive dark core.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9903182,astro-ph,Several explanations for the existence of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays invoke the idea that they originate from the decay of massive particles created in the reheating following inflation. It has been suggested that the decay products can explain the observed isotropic flux of cosmic rays. We have calculated the anisotropy expected for various models of the dark matter distribution and find that at present data are too sparse above equation eV to discriminate between different models. However we show that with data from three years of operation of the southern section of the Pierre Auger Observatory significant progress in testing the proposals will be made.,1999,[],5
astro-ph/9903317,astro-ph,"In the present paper, we introduce a two-component model of the Galactic disk to investigate its chemical evolution. The formation of the thick and thin disks occur in two main accretion episodes with both infall rates to be Gaussian. Both the pre-thin and post-thin scenarios for the formation of the Galactic disk are considered. The best-fitting is obtained through equation-test between the models and the new observed metallicity distribution function of G dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood (Hou et al 1998). Our results show that post-thin disk scenario for the formation of the Galactic disk should be preferred. Still, other comparison between model predictions and observations are given.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9901320,astro-ph,"The reionization of the Universe is expected to leave a signal in the form of a sharp step in the spectrum of the sky. If reionization occurs at 5 < z < 20, a feature should appear in the radio sky at 70 - 240 MHz due to redshifted HI 21-cm line emission, accompanied by another feature in the optical/near-IR at 0.7 - 2.6 micron due to hydrogen recombination radiation. The expected amplitude is well above fundamental detection limits, and the sharpness of the feature may make it distinguishable from variations due to terrestrial, galactic and extragalactic foregrounds.   Because this is essentially a continuum measurement of a signal which occurs over the whole sky, relatively small telescopes may suffice for detection in the radio. In the optical/near-IR, a space telescope is needed with the lowest possible background conditions, since the experiment will be severely background-limited.",1999,[],5

Strong quasi-periodical oscillations (QPO) with a central peak frequency around 9 Hz was detected in one observation of the series performed by PCA/RXTE experiment. X-ray flux from the source during the observation with QPO was maximal. The energy spectrum of XTE J1806--246 at this time was softer than for other observations.

astro-ph/9907083,astro-ph,"We present deep radio maps from the Very Large Array (VLA) for 16 sources detected in a sub-millimeter (submm) survey of the distant Universe. Our deep VLA 1.4-GHz maps allow us to identify radio counterparts or place stringent limits (<20uJy in the source plane) on the radio flux of the submm sources. We compare the spectral indices of our sources between 850um and 1.4GHz to empirical and theoretical models for distant starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) as a function of redshift. In this way we can derive redshift limits for the submm sources, even in the absence of an optical or near-infrared counterpart. We conclude that the submm population brighter than \~1mJy has a median redshift of at least <z>~2, more probably <z>~2.5-3, with almost all galaxies at z>>1. This estimate is a strong lower limit as both misidentification of the radio counterparts and non-thermal emission from an AGN will bias our redshift estimates to lower values. The high median redshift means that the submm population, if predominately powered by starbursts, contributes a substantial fraction of the total star formation density at high redshifts. A comparison of the spectral index limits with spectroscopic redshifts for proposed optical counterparts to individual submm galaxies suggests that half of the submm sources remain unidentified and thus their counterparts must be fainter than I>24.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9901057,astro-ph,"We present results of the investigations of the statistical properties of a joint density and velocity divergence probability distribution function (PDF) in the mildly non-linear regime. For that purpose we use both perturbation theory results, extended here for a top-hat filter, and numerical simulations.   In particular we derive the quantitative (complete as possible up to third order terms) and qualitative predictions for constrained averages and constrained dispersions -- which describe the nonlinearities and the stochasticity properties beyond the linear regime -- and compare them against numerical simulations. We find overall a good agreement for constrained averages; however, the agreement for constrained dispersions is only qualitative. Scaling relations for the Omega-dependence of these quantities are satisfactory reproduced.   Guided by our analytical and numerical results, we finally construct a robust phenomenological description of the joint PDF in a closed analytic form. The good agreement of our formula with results of N-body simulations for a number of cosmological parameters provides a sound validation of the presented approach.   Our results provide a basis for a potentially powerful tool with which it is possible to analyze galaxy survey data in order to test the gravitational instability paradigm beyond the linear regime and put useful constraints on cosmological parameters. In particular we show how the nonlinearity in the density--velocity relation can be used to break the so-called Omega-bias degeneracy in cosmic density-velocity comparisons.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9903412,astro-ph,"The radio source Sgr A* at the center of our Galaxy is believed to be a 2.6 x 106 solar mass black hole which accretes gas from the winds of nearby stars. We show that limits on the X-ray and infrared emission from the Galactic Center provide an upper limit of ~ 8 x 10-5 solar masses per year on the mass accretion rate in Sgr A*. The advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model favors a rate < 10-5 solar masses per year. In comparison, the Bondi accretion rate onto Sgr A*, estimated using the observed spatial distribution of mass losing stars and assuming non-interacting stellar winds, is ~ 3 x 10-5 solar masses per year. There is thus rough agreement between the Bondi, the ADAF, and the X-ray inferred accretion rates for Sgr A*.

Our limit of molecular gas in the inner 7.5 kpc is MH2< 4 x 108 Msun. We estimate the total mass of molecular gas left in the cD galaxy when the gas deposited by a cooling flow once becomes molecular gas and the molecular gas is continuously evaporated by the ambient hot gas. The observational limit of molecular gas requires f >~ 10-3, where f is the ratio of the heat conduction rate to that of Spitzer. However, this contradicts recent X-ray observations showing f<10-5. Thus, the non-detection of CO cannot be explained by the evaporation, and most of the cooled gas predicted by a cooling flow model may not change into molecular gas in the cD galaxy. Moreover, we estimate the evaporation time of molecular clouds brought to a cD galaxy through the capture of gas-rich galaxies and find that these clouds should not be evaporated if f <~ 10-3-10-4. Therefore, the non-detection of CO in a cD galaxy could constrain the total mass of the molecular clouds brought into it.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9910122,astro-ph,"Almost all of the extragalactic X-ray background (XRB) at 0.25 keV can be accounted for by radio-quiet quasars, allowing us to derive an upper limit of 4 \bgunit\ for the remaining background at 0.25 keV. However, the XRB from the gas halos of groups of galaxies, with gas removal due to cooling accounted for, exceeds this upper limit by an order of magnitude if non-gravitational heating is not included. We calculate this using simulations of halo merger trees and realistic gas density profiles, which we require to reproduce the observed gas fractions and abundances of X-ray clusters. In addition, we find that the entire mass range of groups, from equation to equation\Ms, contributes to the 0.25 keV background in this case. In a further study, we reduce the luminosities of groups by maximally heating their gas halos while maintaining the same gas fractions. This only reduces the XRB by a factor of 2 or less. We thus argue that most of the gas associated with groups must be outside their virial radii. This conclusion is supported by X-ray studies of individual groups. The properties of both groups and X-ray clusters can be naturally explained by a model in which the gas is given excess specific energies of equation keV/particle by non-gravitational heating. With this excess energy, the gas is gravitationally unbound from groups, but recollapses with the formation of a cluster of temperature equation keV. This is similar to a model proposed by Pen, but is contrary to the evolution of baryons described by Cen \& Ostriker. (abridged)",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9907118,astro-ph,"The paper presents the first results obtained with the Jodrell Bank - IAC two-element 33 GHz interferometer. The instrument was designed to measure the level of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) fluctuations at angular scales of 1 - 2 degrees. The observations analyzed here were taken in a strip of the sky at Dec = 41 deg with an element separation of 16.7 lambda, which gives a maximum sensitivity to ~1.6 deg structures on the sky. The data processing and calibration of the instrument are described. The sensitivity achieved in each of the two channels is 7 micro K per resolution element. A reconstruction of the sky at Dec = 41 deg using a maximum entropy method shows the presence of structure at a high level of significance. A likelihood analysis, assuming a flat CMB spatial power spectrum, gives a best estimate of the level of CMB fluctuations of Delta Tl = 43 (13,-12) micro K for the range l = 109 /- 19; the main uncertainty in this result arises from sample variance. We consider that the contamination from the Galaxy is small.

astro-ph/9906378,astro-ph,"We present an application of a new set of detailed, self-consistent, dynamical models for disc galaxies. We start from the hypothesis that each galaxy can be decomposed in a bulge, following the r1/4 law, and a disc with an exponential projected density profile; and that the isodensity surfaces of each component can be represented by similar concentric spheroids. After taking into account both the asymmetric drift effects and the integration along the line of sight, we produce the rotational velocity and velocity dispersion profile,and the approximate shape of the line of sight velocity distributions for the stars as parameterized by the h3 and h4 coefficients of the Gauss-Hermite expansion of the line profile.   Photometric and kinematical data have been taken from the literature for the test case of the S0 galaxy NGC 5866, for which detailed stellar kinematical data are available at different positions across the galaxy. Apart from the very inner, dust-obscured regions of the galaxy, where observational effects are likely to be dominant, the model successfully reproduce the whole set of dynamical data available as well as giving a good fit to the photometry. The galaxy is shown to have an isotropic velocity dispersion tensor, thus giving a hint on a dissipational formation process.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9904081,astro-ph,"We present evidence for an expanding superbubble in M82 (diameter: ~130 pc, expansion velocity: ~45 km/s, mass: ~8*106 SM). It is seen in the 12CO(J=1-0), 12CO(J=2-1), 13CO(J=1-0) and C18O(J=1-0) lines. The superbubble is centred around the most powerful supernova remnant in M82, 41.958. The CO observations show that the molecular superbubble already broke out of the disk. This scenario is supported by ROSAT HRI observations which suggest that hot coronal gas originating from inside the shell is the main contributor to the diffuse X-ray outflow in M82. We briefly discuss observations of the same region at other wavelengths (radio continuum, optical, HI, X-rays, ionized gas). From our spectral line observations, we derive a kinematic age of about 106 years for the superbubble. Using simple theoretical models, the total energy needed for the creation of this superbubble is of order 2*1054 ergs. The required energy input rate (0.001 SN yr-1) is reasonable given the high supernova (SN) rate of ~0.1 SN yr-1 in the central part of M82. As much as 10% of the energy needed to create the superbubble is still present in form of the kinetic energy of the expanding molecular shell. Of order 10% is conserved in the hot X-ray emitting gas emerging from the superbubble into the halo of M82. This newly detected expanding molecular superbubble is believed to be powered by the same objects that also lie at the origin of the prominent X-ray outflow in M82.

In the model, the central BH is assumed to be formed at equation and obtains nearly maximum but finite rotation energy (equation extreme Kerr BH) at the formation stage. The inherently obtained rotation energy of the Kerr BH is released through an magnetohydrodynamic process. This model naturally leads finite lifetime of AGN activity.   Nitta et al.

astro-ph/9907250,astro-ph,"The aperture mass has been shown in a series of recent publications to be a useful quantitative tool for weak lensing studies, ranging from cosmic shear to the detection of a mass-selected sample of dark matter haloes. Quantitative analytical predictions for the aperture mass have been based on a number of simplifying assumptions. In this paper, we test the reliability of these assumptions and the quality of the analytic approximations, using ray-tracing simulations through a cosmological density field generated by very large N-body simulations. We find that those analytic predictions which take into account the non-linear evolution of the matter distribution, such as the dispersion of the aperture mass and the halo abundance, are surprisingly accurately reproduced with our numerical results, whereas the predictions for the skewness, based on quasi-linear theory, are rather imprecise. In particular, we verify numerically that the probability distribution of the aperture mass decreases exponentially for values much larger than the rms.

Here, we show that the situation can be improved substantially in models where cosmic strings are formed at the end of inflation, and in which both inflation and strings participate in the generation of structure.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9902173,astro-ph,"I review measurements of element abundances in different components of the high redshift universe, including the Lyman alpha forest, damped Lyman alpha systems, and Lyman break galaxies. Although progress is being made in all three areas, recent work has also produced some surprises and shown that established ideas about the nature of the damped Lyman alpha systems in particular may be too simplistic. Overall, our knowledge of metal abundances at high z is still very sketchy. Most significantly, there seems to be an order of magnitude shortfall in the comoving density of metals which have been measured up to now compared with those produced by the star formation activity seen in Lyman break galaxies. At least some of the missing metals are likely to be in hot gas in galactic halos and proto-clusters.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9905245,astro-ph,"We report broad-band X-ray measurements of the Be star Gamma Cassiopeiae by the BeppoSAX X-ray astronomy satellite. The observations took place on 1998 July, 18-23. The 0.1-200 keV X-ray spectrum is reasonably well fit by an optically thin thermal plasma model of temperature 12.5 /- 0.6 keV with significant residuals around 0.3 keV and 1 keV. The former is interpreted as the variable soft component reported by ROSAT, although there is no evidence for variability at the 5 % level. For a blackbody interpretation, the fitted temperature is 100 320 -13 eV, in agreement with the ROSAT value of 200 /- 10 eV. However, a MEKAL interpretation gives a significantly lower temperature of (48 /- 11 eV). The fitted abundances are about half solar values, in agreement with previous measurements. At higher energies, the spectrum does not require non-thermal components and the observation of a line at 6.8 keV supports the ASCA interpretation of the source as an accreting white dwarf. Assuming a source distance of 188 pc, the bolometric luminosity in the 2-10 keV band is 6 1032 erg/s. Simultaneous optical measurements by the Wendelstein Observatory near Munich, indicate that the source continues to be in a late but rather normal Be phase, with no obvious signs of a transition to the Be-shell phase. The measured magnitudes at B, V and R wavelengths of 2.18 /- 0.06, 2.23 /- 0.02 and 2.36  /- 0.03, respectively, confirm this.",1999,[],5

These observations, together with other published photometric data, allowed to monitor the faint tail of the decaying Optical Transient (OT) associated to the GRB990510.

This result depends marginally on cluster parameters and it can be used to estimate the number density of clusters with enough hot gas to produce a detectable Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. Comparing different cosmological models, the relation depends mainly on the density parameter Omegam. If the number density of clusters could be estimated by a different method, then this dependence could be used to constrain Omegam.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9912200,astro-ph,"We present observations and analyses of seven Galactic O stars of type O6 and earlier. Analyses are carried out using NLTE plane-parallel, hydrostatic models as well as NLTE spherical models with mass-loss. With detailed calculations for the former and simulations for the latter, it is shown that the flux blocking due to UV metal lines is important for these objects and the way the mechanism operates is explained. We find that the plane-parallel, hydrostatic unblanketed model atmospheres have increasing difficulties in fitting the early-type spectra of massive stars, and for 50000 K and above a fit seems to be impossible. We then perform an analysis using spherical models with mass-loss. Gravities should be increased by 0.1-0.25 dex, reducing, but not solving, the mass discrepancy. We show that spectroscopic masses are in better agreement with the theory of radiatively driven winds than evolutionary masses are. A helium abundance larger than solar is obtained for most objects. Some additional effects (partly related to present approximations) that have an influence in our analyses are studied. Some stars of our sample have such high mass-loss rates that the derivation of gravities from the wings of Balmer lines, in particular Hgamma, becomes doubtful.   From the point of view of individual stars, we have analysed some of the most massive and luminous stars in the Milky Way. According to our analysis, three of them (Cyg OB2-7, HD 15570 and HD15558) have particularly large initial masses, close to or in excess of 100 Msun.

astro-ph/9911235,astro-ph,"We challenge the widely held belief that the cosmological principle is an obvious consequence of the observed isotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation, combined with the Copernican principle. We perform a detailed analysis of a class of inhomogeneous perfect fluid cosmologies admitting an isotropic radiation field, with a view to assessing their viability as models of the real universe. These spacetimes are distinguished from FLRW universes by the presence of inhomogeneous pressure, which results in an acceleration of the fundamental observers. We examine their physical, geometrical and observational characteristics for all observer positions in the spacetimes. To this end, we derive exact, analytic expressions for the distance-redshift relations and anisotropies for any observer, and compare their predictions with available observational constraints. The isotropy constraints derived from `local' observations are also considered, qualitatively. A crucial aspect of this work is the application of the Copernican principle: for a specific model to be acceptable we demand that it must be consistent with current observational constraints (especially anisotropy constraints) for all observer locations. The most important results of the paper are presented as exclusion plots in the 2-D parameter space of the models. We show that there is a region of parameter space not ruled out by the constraints we consider and containing models that are significantly inhomogeneous. It follows immediately from this that the cosmological principle cannot be assumed to hold on the basis of present observational constraints.",1999,[],5

We have measured the photometric properties of Mrk 273X and have also analyzed the luminosity distribution of the faint galaxy population seen in the HST image. The luminosity of the galaxy and the properties of the surrounding environment suggest that Mrk 273X is the brightest galaxy in a relatively poor cluster at a redshift near 0.46. Its off-center location in the cluster and the presence of other galaxy groupings in the HST image may indicate that this is a dynamically young cluster on the verge of merging with its neighboring clusters. We find that Mrk 273X is a bright featureless elliptical galaxy with no evidence for a disk. It follows the de Vaucouleurs (r1/4) surface brightness law very well over a range of 8 magnitudes. Though the surface brightness profile does not appear to be dominated by the AGN, the galaxy has very blue colors that do appear to be produced by the AGN.

astro-ph/9904367,astro-ph,"The implications of the massive, X-ray selected cluster of galaxies MS1054--03 at equation are discussed in light of the hypothesis that the primordial density fluctuations may be nongaussian. We generalize the Press-Schechter (PS) formalism to the nongaussian case, and calculate the likelihood that a cluster as massive as MS1054 would appear in the EMSS. The probability of finding an MS1054-like cluster depends only on equation and the extent of primordial nongaussianity. We quantify the latter by adopting a specific functional form for the PDF, denoted equation which tends to Gaussianity for equation and show how equation is related to the more familiar statistic equation the probability of equation fluctuations for a given PDF relative to a Gaussian. We find that Gaussian initial density fluctuations are consistent with the data on MS1054 only if equation For equation a significant degree of nongaussianity is required, unless the mass of MS1054 has been substantially overestimated by X-ray and weak lensing data. The required amount of nongaussianity is a rapidly increasing function of equation for equation with equation (equation) at the upper end of this range. For a fiducial equation equation universe, favored by several lines of evidence we obtain an upper limit equation corresponding to a equation This finding is consistent with the conclusions of Koyama, Soda, & Taruya (1999), who applied the generalized PS formalism to low (equation) and intermediate (equation) redshift cluster data sets.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9901285,astro-ph,"We discuss the interpretation of transient, unpulsed radio emission detected from the unique pulsar/Be-star binary system PSR B1259-63. Extensive monitoring of the 1994 and 1997 periastron passages has shown that the source flares over a 100-day interval around periastron, varying on time-scales as short as a day and peaking at 60 mJy (~100 times the apastron flux density) at 1.4 GHz. Interpreting the emission as synchrotron radiation, we show that (i) the observed variations in flux density are too large to be caused by the shock interaction between the pulsar wind and an isotropic, radiatively driven, Be-star wind, and (ii) the radio emitting electrons do not originate from the pulsar wind. We argue instead that the radio electrons originate from the circumstellar disk of the Be star and are accelerated at two epochs, one before and one after periastron, when the pulsar passes through the disk. A simple model incorporating two epochs of impulsive acceleration followed by synchrotron cooling reproduces the essential features of the radio light curve and spectrum and is consistent with the system geometry inferred from pulsed radio data.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9910321,astro-ph,"With their rapid, violent variability and broad featureless continuum emission, blazars have puzzled astronomers for over two decades. Today blazars represent the only extragalactic objects detected in high-energy gamma-rays. Their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are characteristically double-humped, with lower-energy emission originating as synchrotron radiation in a relativistically beamed jet, and higher-energy emission due to inverse-Compton processes. This has accentuated the biases inherent in any survey to favor objects which are bright in the survey band, and should serve as a cautionary note both to those designing new surveys as well as theorists attempting to model blazar properties. The location of the synchrotron peak determines which blazar population is dominant at GeV and TeV energies. At GeV energies, low-energy peaked, high luminosity objects, which have high equation ratios, dominate, while at TeV energies, high-energy peaked objects are all that is seen. I review the differences between low-energy peaked and high-energy peaked blazars, and models to explain those differences. I also look at efforts to bridge the gap between these classes with new surveys. Two new surveys have detected a large population of high-energy peaked emission line blazars (FSRQ), with properties somewhat different from previously known objects. This discovery has the potential to revolutionize blazar physics in a way comparable to the discovery of X-ray selected BL Lacs ten years ago by \it Einstein.

astro-ph/9901100,astro-ph,"We present the results of modelling the distribution of gas properties in the galaxy groups HCG51, HCG62 and NGC5044, and in the poor cluster AWM7, using both ASCA SIS and ROSAT data. The spectral quality of the ASCA data allows the radial distribution in the abundances of several elements to be resolved. In all systems apart from HCG51, we see both central cooling flows, and a general decline in metal abundances with radius. The ratio of iron to alpha-element abundances varies significantly, and in comparison with theoretical supernova yields, indicates a significant contribution to the metal abundance of the intergalactic medium (IGM) from type Ia supernovae. This is seen both within the groups, and also throughout much of the cluster AWM7. The total energy input into the IGM from supernovae can be calculated from our results, and is typically 20-40 per cent of the thermal energy of the gas, mostly from SNe II. Our results support the idea that the SN II ejecta have been more widely distributed in the IGM, probably due to the action of galaxy winds, and the lower iron mass to light ratio in groups suggests that some of this enriched gas has been lost altogether from the shallower potential wells of the smaller systems.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9904056,astro-ph,"Using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) we have imaged the fields around five promising pulsar candidates to search for radio pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). We have used the ATCA in its pulsar gating mode; this enables an image to be formed containing only off-pulse visibilities, thereby dramatically improving the sensitivity to any underlying PWN. Data from the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope were also used to provide sensitivity on larger spatial scales. This survey found a faint new PWN around PSR B0906-49; here we report on non-detections of PWNe towards PSRs B1046-58, B1055-52, B1610-50 and J1105-6107. Our radio observations of the field around PSR B1055-52 argue against previous claims of an extended X-ray and radio PWNe associated with the pulsar. If these pulsars power unseen, compact radio PWN, upper limits on the radio flux indicate that less than 1e-6 of their spin-down energy is used to power this emission. Alternatively PSR B1046-58 and PSR B1610-50 may have relativistic winds similar to other young pulsars and the unseen PWN is resolved and fainter than our surface brightness sensitivity threshold. We can then determine upper limits on the local ISM density of 2.2e-3 cm-3 and 1e-2 cm-3, respectively. Furthermore we constrain the spatial velocities of these pulsars to be less than ~450 km/s and thus rule out the association of PSR B1610-50 with SNR G332.400.1 (Kes 32).

astro-ph/9907330,astro-ph,"We construct detailed vertical structure models of irradiated accretion disks around T Tauri stars with interstellar medium dust uniformly mixed with gas. The dependence of the structure and emission properties on mass accretion rate, viscosity parameter, and disk radius is explored using these models. The theoretical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and images for all inclinations are compared with observations of the entire population of Classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) and Class I objects in Taurus. In particular, we find that the median near-infrared fluxes can be explained within the errors with the most recent values for the median accretion rates for CTTS. We further show that the majority of the Class I sources in Taurus cannot be Class II sources viewed edge-on because they are too luminous and their colors would be consistent with disks seen only in a narrow range of inclinations. Our models appear to be too geometrically thick at large radii, as suggested by: (a) larger far-infrared disk emission than in the typical SEDs of T Tauri stars; (b) wider dark dust lanes in the model images than in the images of HH30 and HK Tau/c; and (c) larger predicted number of stars extincted by edge-on disks than consistent with current surveys.

The contrast between the rest-frame far-red (8200-9800A) and near-UV (2900-3900A) morphologies suggests that the central regions of the galaxy are heavily obscured by dust and that the galaxy is most likely an interacting or disturbed system. We also present new photometry of this object at 450, 850 and 1350 microns obtained using SCUBA on the JCMT. The rest-frame SED of this ERO is best understood in terms of a highly reddened stellar population with ongoing star formation, as originally suggested by Graham & Dey (1996). The new sub-mm data presented here indicate that the remarkable similarity to ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) such as Arp220 extends into the rest-frame far-IR which bears the signature of thermal emission from dust. ERO J1645024626.4 is extremely luminous (7E12 Lsun) and dusty (M[dust] = 7E8 Msun). If its luminosity is powered by young hot stars, then ERO J1645024626.4 is forming stars at the prodigious rate of 1000-2000 Msun/yr. We conclude that it is a distant analogue of the nearby ULIRG population, the more distant or less luminous counterparts of which may be missed by even the deepest existing optical surveys.

astro-ph/9906101,astro-ph,"We determine simple analytical conditions for combined radiative and thermal equilibrium between the X-ray emitting plasma and cold reprocessor in active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galactic black holes (GBH). These conditions determine the pressure at the transition zone, which is not arbitrary in the static situation. The conditions for static solution are derived analytically for different forms of plasma heating and for cooling provided by Compton cooling, bremsstrahlung, and (optionally) advective cooling.   We conclude that if Compton heating is the only heating mechanism, we always achieve static equilibrium between the phases. For constant volume heating and radiatively cooled plasma the static solution is never achieved and evaporation or condensation takes place. However, static solutions with no evaporation/condensation are found for radiative cooling supplemented with lateral advection. Similar results are obtained for a two-temperature plasma. In the case of a general prescription of mechanical heating (equation) of radiatively-cooled one-temperature plasma, we found that static solution is only possible, when equation.   Such conditions apply to all models, like disc/corona solutions, ADAF flows at their outer ADAF/disc boundary or cold clumps embedded in a hot medium.

We evaluate the dipolar and higher order harmonic structure in 4 X-ray colours. The estimated dipole anisotropy of the unresolved flux appears to be consistent with a combination of the Compton-Getting effect due to the Local Group motion (dipole amplitude Delta = 0.0042) and remaining large scale structure (0.0023 <~ Delta <~ 0.0085), in good agreement with the expectations of Cold Dark Matter models. The observed anisotropy does however also suggest a non-negligible Galactic contribution which is more complex than current, simple models of >2 keV Galactic X-ray emission. Comparison of the soft and hard colour maps with a harmonic analysis of the 1.5 keV ROSAT all-sky data qualitatively suggests that at least a third of the faint, unresolved ~ 18 deg scale structure in the HEAO1-A2 data may be Galactic in origin. However, the effect on measured flux dipoles is small (<~3%).

Assuming a realistic letterV \approx 300 km/s yields a shape parameter letter ~ 0.25 and normalisation b letter8 ~ 0.75; if letterV is as high as 600 km/s then letter = 0.5 is only marginally excluded. There is little evidence for any `preferred scale' in the power spectrum or non-Gaussian behaviour in the distribution of large-scale power.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9906146,astro-ph,"We have commenced a 21-cm survey of the entire southern sky (letter < 0 degrees, -1200 km/s < v < 12700 km/s) which is 'blind', i.e. unbiased by previous optical information. In the present paper we report on the results of a pilot project which is based on data from this all-sky survey. The project was carried out on an area of 600 square degrees centred on the nearby Centaurus A (Cen A) group of galaxies at a mean velocity of v ~ 500 km/s. This was recently the subject of a separate and thorough optical survey.   We found 10 new group members to add to the 21 galaxies already known in the Cen A group: five of these are previously uncatalogued galaxies, while five were previously catalogued but not known to be associated with the group.   We found optical counterparts for all the HI detections, most of them intrinsically very faint low surface brightness dwarfs. The new group members add approximately 6% to the HI mass of the group and 4% to its light. The HI mass function, derived from all the known group galaxies in the interval 107 \Msun of HI to 109 \Msun of HI, has a faint-end slope of 1.30 /- 0.15, allowing us to rule out a slope of 1.7 at 95% confidence. Even if the number in the lowest mass bin is increased by 50%, the slope only increases to 1.45 /- 0.15.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9902325,astro-ph,"X-ray reflection spectra are an important component in the X-ray spectra of many active galactic nuclei and Galactic black hole candidates. It is likely that reflection takes place from highly ionized surfaces of the accretion disc in some cases. This can lead to strong Comptonization of the emergent iron, and other, absorption and emission features. We present such reflection spectra here, computed in a self-consistent manner with the method described by Ross and Fabian. In particular we emphasise the range where the ionization parameter (the flux to density ratio) letter is around and above 104. Such spectra may be relevant to the observed spectral features found in black hole candidates such as Cygnus X-1 in the low/hard state.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9909046,astro-ph,"We are carrying out an international, multi-wavelength program to determine the fundamental properties and independent distance estimates of selected eclipsing binaries in the LMC and SMC. Eclipsing binaries with well-defined double-line radial velocity curves and light curves provide valuable information on orbital and physical properties of their component stars. The study of stars in the LMC and SMC where the metal abundances are significantly lower than solar provides an important opportunity to test stellar atmosphere, interior and evolution models, and opacities. For the first time, we can also measure direct M-L relations for stars outside our Galaxy. In this paper we concentrate on the determination of the orbital and physical properties of HV 2274 from analyses of light curves and new radial velocity curves formed from HST/GHRS observations. From UV/optical spectrophotometry of HV 2274 obtained with HST/FOS, the temperatures and the metallicity of the stars were found, as well as the interstellar extinction of the system. The values of mass, absolute radius, and effective temperature, for the primary and secondary stars are: 12.2(7) Mo, 9.9(2) Ro, 23000(180) K, and 11.4(7) Mo, 9.0(2) Ro, 23110(180) K, respectively. The age of the system (17(2) Myr), helium abundance (Y=0.26(3)) and a lower limit of the convective core overshooting parameter of 0.2 were obtained from fitting the stellar data with evolution models. The apsidal motion analysis corroborates that some amount of convective overshooting (0.2-0.5) is needed.",1999,[],5

A key feature of the model is jet-sidedness, which can now be determined for about 80% of the FRII sources in the 3CRR complete sample. It is shown that a simple asymmetric relativistic model can account for a wide range of observational data, and that the relativistic and intrinsic asymmetry effects are of comparable importance. The mean translational speed of the lobes is 0.12c with a standard deviation 0.04c. The results are in agreement with an orientation-based unified scheme in which the critical angle separating the radio galaxies from the radio quasars is about 50 degrees.",1999,[],5

In this paper we present high sensitivity images at arcsecond resolution of the 18 objects showing extended structure in our images, and of another source from the FIRST (Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm) survey (Becker et al. 1995). In general our high sensitivity images reveal an amount of extended emission larger than previously reported.

astro-ph/9907297,astro-ph,"We report the discovery with the proportional counter array (PCA) onboard the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) of a decrease in the frequency of X-ray brightness oscillations in the cooling tail of an X-ray burst from 4U 1636-53. This is the first direct evidence for a spin down of the pulsations seen during thermonuclear bursts. We find that the spin down episode is correlated with the appearance in this burst of an extended tail of emission. We present both time resolved energy and variability spectra during this burst and compare them with results from a second burst which shows neither a spin down episode nor an extended tail. A spectral evolution study of the 'spin down' burst reveals a secondary signature of weak radius expansion, not seen in other bursts, and correlated with the spin down episode, which may indicate a secondary thermonuclear energy release. We interpret the spin down episode in the context of an angular momentum conserving shell, which is reexpanded and therefore spun down by an additional thermonuclear energy release which could also explain the extended X-ray tail.",1999,[],5

In order to minimize non-linear effects and to deal with ill-sampled regions we smooth both fields using a Gaussian window with radii ranging between equation. The density and velocity fields within equation exhibit similarities, qualitatively consistent with gravitational instability theory and a linear biasing relation between clusters and mass. The random and systematic errors are evaluated with the help of mock catalogs. Quantitative comparisons within a volume containing equation independent samples yield equation, where equation is the cluster biasing parameter at equation.

astro-ph/9901083,astro-ph,"It is well known that the accretion disk around a magnetized compact star can penetrate inside the magnetospheric boundary, so the magnetospheric radius equation does not represent the true inner edge equation of the disk; but controversies exist in the literature concerning the relation between equation and equation. In the model of Ghosh & Lamb, the width of the boundary layer is given by equation, or equation, while Li & Wickramasinghe recently argued that equation could be significantly smaller than equation in the case of a slow rotator. Here we show that if the star is able to absorb the angular momentum of disk plasma at equation, appropriate for binary X-ray pulsars, the inner disk radius can be constrained by equation, and the star reaches spin equilibrium with a relatively large value of the fastness parameter (equation). For accreting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), equation is generally close to the stellar radius equation so that the toroidal field cannot transfer the spin-up torque efficiently to the star. In this case the critical fastness parameter becomes smaller, but equation is still near equation.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9901375,astro-ph,"III Zw 2 is a spiral galaxy with an optical spectrum and faint extended radio structure typical of a Seyfert galaxy, but also with an extremely variable, blazar-like radio core. We have now discovered a new radio flare where the source has brightened more than twenty-fold within less than two years. A broad-band radio spectrum between 1.4 and 666 GHz shows a textbook-like synchrotron spectrum peaking at 43 GHz, with a self-absorbed synchrotron spectral index 2.5 at frequencies below 43 GHz and an optically thin spectral index -0.75 at frequencies above 43 GHz. The outburst spectrum can be well fitted by two homogenous, spherical components with equipartition sizes of 0.1 and 0.2 pc at 43 and 15 GHz, and with magnetic fields of 0.4 and 1 Gauss. VLBA observations at 43 GHz confirm this double structure and these sizes. Time scale arguments suggest that the emitting regions are shocks which are continuously accelerating particles. This could be explained by a frustrated jet scenario with very compact hotspots. Similar millimeter-peaked spectrum (MPS) sources could have escaped our attention because of their low flux density at typical survey frequencies and their strong variability.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9908185,astro-ph,"Two-dimensional (axially symmetric) numerical hydrodynamical calculations of accretion flows which cannot cool through emission of radiation are presented. The calculations begin from an equilibrium configuration consisting of a thick torus with constant specific angular momentum. Accretion is induced by the addition of a small anomalous azimuthal shear stress which is characterized by a function letter. We study the flows generated as the amplitude and form of letter are varied. A spherical polar grid which spans more than two orders of magnitude in radius is used to resolve the flow over a wide range of spatial scales. We find that convection in the inner regions produces significant outward mass motions that carry away both the energy liberated by, and a large fraction of the mass participating in, the accretion flow. Although the instantaneous structure of the flow is complex and dominated by convective eddies, long time averages of the dynamical variables show remarkable correspondence to certain steady-state solutions. Near the equatorial plane, the radial profiles of the time-averaged variables are power-laws with an index that depends on the radial scaling of the shear stress. We find that regardless of the adiabatic index of the gas, or the form or magnitude of the shear stress, the mass inflow rate is a strongly increasing function of radius, and is everywhere nearly exactly balanced by mass outflow. The net mass accretion rate through the disc is only a fraction of the rate at which mass is supplied to the inflow at large radii, and is given by the local, viscous accretion rate associated with the flow properties near the central object.",1999,[],5

In consort with 13000 galaxies in a similarly defined low redshift sample from the Las Campanas Redshift survey we find that the comoving correlation can be described as xi(rz) = (r00/r)gamma (1z)-(3e) with r00=5.08 /- 0.08/h Mpc, e=0.02 /- 0.23 and gamma=1.81 /- 0.03 over the z=0.03 to 0.65 redshift range in a cosmology with OmegaM=0.2, Lambda=0.

We combine the model fits from 44 VLBI observations of 3C345 made at 8 different frequencies between 2.3 and 100GHz. We calculate the turnover frequency, turnover flux density, integrated 4-25GHz flux and 4-25GHz luminosity of the core and the moving features. The core has an estimated mean luminosity of 7.1/-3.5 * 1042 erg/s; the estimated total luminosity of 3C345 on parsec scales is ~3*1043 erg/s (about 1% of the observed luminosity of the source between the radio to infrared regimes). The spectral changes in the core can be reconciled with a shock or dense plasma condensation traveling through the region where the jet becomes optically thin. We are able to describe the evolution of the core spectrum by a sequence of 5 flare-like events characterized by an exponential rise and decay of the particle number density of the material injected into the jet. The same model is also capable of predicting the changes in the flux density observed in the core. The flares occur approximately every 3.5-4 years, roughly correlating with appearances of new moving features in the jet.",1999,[],5

We show that the relative redshifts of different ionization states of metals in the ICM provide a unique probe of the three-dimensional matter distribution. An examination of the reported peculiar velocities of cD galaxies in well studied Abell clusters reveals they are typically redshifted by an average of equation km/s. This can be achieved by gravity with the addition of a steep central potential associated with the cD galaxy.

These corrections for nonlinear effects are essential in order to use the the cosmological redshift-space distortion as a cosmological test. We perform a feasibility test to derive constraints from the future catalogues of high-redshift quasars using our theoretical modeling and results of N-body simulations.

astro-ph/9912504,astro-ph,"The interplay between the ISM and the massive stars formed in clusters and, more generally, in recent events of star formation is reviewed via the global effects each has on the other. The pre-existing environment affects the properties of the massive stars, the duration of the star-forming event and could potentially affect the IMF. The collective effect of massive-star winds and supernova explosions creates a structured ISM by forming bubbles, supershells and, in more extreme cases, by inducing large-scale gas outflows. Gas/dust removal may quench star formation in young stellar clusters. Conversely, supernova-driven shocks may trigger star formation in molecular clouds surrounding the stellar clusters. Metal ejection from the massive stars is responsible for the pollution of the ISM and, if the metal-rich gas can escape the galaxy's gravitational potential, of the IGM. The environment where stellar clusters form is populated by a diffuse stellar population which contributes between 50% and 80% of the total UV light. The investigation of the nature of the diffuse UV light is the subject of a study employing HST STIS spectroscopy, whose preliminary results are presented and briefly discussed.",1999,[],5

We present initial results for a 34 sq.deg. area spanning Orion 1b, 1a and the B Cloud. Using variability as our main selection criterion we derive much cleaner samples than with the usual single-epoch photometric selection, allowing us to attain a much higher efficiency in follow up spectroscopy and resulting in an preliminary list of 74 new low-mass (~ 0.4 Msun) pre-main sequence stars.   Though preliminary, this list of new T Tauri stars already suggests that the fraction of accreting young stars in 1a is much lower than in 1b, which would be expected if 1a is indeed older than 1b.

astro-ph/9904362,astro-ph,"We examine recent results of two kinds of microlensing experiments intended to detect galactic dark matter objects, and we suggest that the lack of short period star-microlensing events observed for stars near the Galaxy does not preclude either the 'rogue planets' identified from quasar-microlensing by Schild 1996 as the missing-mass of a lens galaxy, or the clumps of such objects predicted by the new Gibson 1996-2000 hydro-gravitational theory as the inner-halo galactic dark matter. We point out that such micro-brown-dwarfs in nonlinear accretional cascades to form stars give intermittent lognormal number density np distributions. Hence, star-microlensing searches that focus on a small fraction of the sky and assume a uniform distribution for np are subject to undersampling errors. Sparse independent samples give modes smaller than means of the highly skewed lognormal distributions expected. Quasar-microlensing searches with higher optical depths are less affected by intermittency. We attempt to reconcile the results of the star-microlensing and quasar-microlensing studies.

The spin--down, induced by dipole losses and the interaction with the ambient medium, is tracked together with the dynamical evolution in the Galactic potential, allowing for the determination of the fraction of stars which are, at present, in each of the four possible stages: Ejector, Propeller, Accretor, and Georotator. Taking from the ROSAT All Sky Survey an upper limit of equation accreting neutron stars within equation pc from the Sun, we infer a lower bound for the mean kick velocity, equation equation corresponding to a velocity dispersion equation km sequation. The same conclusion is reached for both a constant magnetic field (equation G) and a magnetic field decaying exponentially with a timescale equation yr.

In the second part of the contribution the emphasis is on the stellar populations of Galactic dSphs. Recent results for the ages of the oldest populations are presented. These data, together with similar recent results for Galactic halo and LMC globular clusters, indicate that regardless of the subsequent star formation history, the initial epoch of star formation was well synchronized throughout the entire proto-Galactic halo. The implications of the first high dispersion studies of element abundance ratios in Galactic dSph red giants are also discussed.

astro-ph/9903180,astro-ph,"The rapid variability of blazars in almost all wavelengths is now well established. Two days of observations were conducted at the Palomar Observatory during the nights of 25 and 26 February 1997 with the 5-meter Hale telescope, in order to search for rapid variability in the near-infrared (NIR) bands J, H, Ks for a selection of eight blazars. With the possible exception of 1156295 (4C 29.45), no intraday or day-to-day variability was observed during these two nights. However, for these eight blazars, we have measured the NIR luminosities and spectral indices. It has recently been reported that the gamma-ray emission is better correlated with the near-infrared luminosity than with the X-ray luminosity. This correlation is suggested as a general property of blazars because hot dust is the main source of soft photons which are scattered off the relativistic jets of electrons to produce the gamma rays by inverse Compton scattering. We thus used this relationship to estimate the gamma-ray luminosity.",1999,[],5

Observations in the 21 cm line of the H I `halos' around the Taurus molecular gas show many features (broad asymmetric profiles, velocity shifts of H I relative to equationCO) predicted by our MHD numerical simulations, in which large-scale H I streams collide to produce dense filamentary structures. This rapid evolution is possible because the H I flows producing and disrupting the cloud have much higher velocities (5-10 kms) than present in the molecular gas resulting from the colliding flows. The simulations suggest that such flows can occur from the global ISM turbulence without requiring a single triggering event such as a SN explosion.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9910413,astro-ph,"We present results from a BeppoSAX observation of the rich cluster Abell 3266. The broad band spectrum (2-50 keV) of the cluster, when fitted with an optically thin thermal emission model, yields a temperature of 8.1 /- 0.2 keV and a metal abundance of 0.17 /- 0.02 in solar units, and with no evidence of a hard X-ray excess in the PDS spectrum. By performing a spatially resolved spectral analysis we find that the projected temperature drops with increasing radius, going from ~ 10 keV at the cluster core to ~ 5 keV at about 1.5 Mpc. Our BeppoSAX temperature profile is in good agreement with the ASCA temperature profile of Markevitch et al. (1998). From our two-dimensional temperature map we find that the gradient is observed in all azimuthal directions. The temperature gradient may have been caused by a recent merger event also responsible for a velocity dispersion gradient measured in the optical band. The projected metal abundance profile and two-dimensional map are both consistent with being constant.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9903420,astro-ph,"Techniques for inferring the radial and geometric form of dark matter halos and the results they have produced to date are reviewed. Dark halos appear to extend to at least ~50 kpc with total enclosed masses that rise linearly with radius R. Whether this behavior can be extrapolated to distances as large as 200 kpc and beyond is controversial; results at this radius are model-dependent. Observationally, the geometrical form of the dark halo can be characterized by the equatorial axis ratio b/a (ovalness) and vertical-to-equatorial axis ratio c/a (flattening) of the total density. Different techniques consistently yield b/a > 0.7 (and thus b/a > 0.9 for the potential) at R~20 kpc, with more axisymmetric values, b/a >~ 0.8, being more likely. Results are less consistent for the vertical flattening, perhaps due to the difference in the spatial regions probed by different techniques or inappropriate assumptions. Techniques that probe furthest from the stellar plane z~15 kpc consistently implicate substantially flattened c/a = 0.5 /- 0.2 dark halos. These axis ratios are in acceptable agreement with expectations from N-body simulations of cold dark matter mixed with ~10% dissipational gas.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9905265,astro-ph,"We determined the separations of the radio sources in the triangle formed by the BL Lac objects 1803784 and 2007777, and the QSO 1928738 from intercontinental interferometric observations carried out in November 1991 at the frequencies of 2.3 and 8.4 GHz simultaneously. We successfully connected differenced phase delays over 7o on the sky at 8.4 GHz at an epoch of maximum solar activity. The effects of the ionosphere on these VLBI data were mostly removed by estimates of the total electron content from observations of GPS satellites. The comparison of the estimated separation of QSO 1928738 and BL 2007777 with previous such estimates obtained from data at different epochs leads us to a particular alignment of the maps of QSO 1928738 at different epochs relative to those of BL 2007777, although with significant uncertainty. For this alignment, the jet components of QSO 1928738 show a mean proper motion of 0.32/-0.10 mas/yr and also suggest an identification for the position of the core of this radio source.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9904403,astro-ph,"The two anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) with well-sampled timing histories, 1E 1048.1-5937 and 1E 2259586, are known to spin down irregularly, with `bumps' superimposed on an overall linear trend. Here we show that if AXPs are non-accreting magnetars, i.e. isolated neutron stars with surface magnetic fields B0 > 1010 T, then they spin down electromagnetically in exactly the manner observed, due to an effect called `radiative precession'. Internal hydromagnetic stresses deform the star, creating a fractional difference epsilon=(I3-I1)/I1 ~ 10-8 between the principal moments of inertia I1 and I3; the resulting Eulerian precession couples to an oscillating component of the electromagnetic torque associated with the near-zone radiation fields, and the star executes an anharmonic wobble with period taupr ~ 2 pi / epsilon Omega(t) ~ 10 yr, where Omega(t) is the rotation frequency as a function of time t. We solve Euler's equations for a biaxial magnet rotating in vacuo; show that the computed Omega(t) matches the measured timing histories of 1E 1048.1-5937 and 1E 2259586; predict Omega(t) for the next 20 years for both objects; predict a statistical relation between <d(Omega)/dt> and taupr, to be tested as the population of known AXPs grows; and hypothesize that radiative precession will be observed in future X-ray timing of soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs).",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9911278,astro-ph,"Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) require mass accretion onto the central engine. On large galactic scales, torques from a stellar bar can efficiently remove angular momentum from gas, and cause it to move inwards along two hydrodynamical shocks on the leading edges of the bar. Inflowing gas settles on near-circular orbits around the Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR), and forms a nuclear ring, about 1 kpc in size. A secondary bar inside the main one, with its own pair of shocks, has been proposed to drive further inflow, and thus feed the AGN in a manner similar to the inflow on large scales. Here, we report results of high resolution hydrodynamical simulations, where we examine the nature of the nuclear ring, and check how efficient double bars can be in fueling AGNs.",1999,[],5

In this paper we discuss the correlation between the luminosities of the radio, optical and X-ray cores in these objects, and argue that all three components have a common origin at the base of the relativistic jets. In unified models, FRI radio galaxies should appear as dimmed, redshifted versions of BL Lac objects.

astro-ph/9904181,astro-ph,"We study the spectral signatures arising from cooling and recombination of an interstellar medium whose equilibrium state has been altered over \sim 100 pc by the radiation of a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) and its afterglow. We identify signatures in the line diagnostics which are indicative of a photo-ionized GRB remnant which is \la 5 x 104 years old . We estimate that at least a few such remnants should be detectable in the Virgo cluster of galaxies. If the gamma-ray emission from GRBs is beamed to a fraction fb of their sky, then the expected number of Virgo remnants is larger by a factor of fb-1. Virgo remnants can be resolved with arcsecond imaging, and are likely to be center-filled using narrow-band filters of high ionization lines (such as [O III] letter5007 or He II letter4686), and limb-brightened for low-ionization lines (such as [S II] letter6717). The non-relativistic blast wave might be visible separately, since it does not reach the outer edge of these young photo-ionized remnants. The remnants should show evidence for ionization cones if the prompt or afterglow UV emission from GRBs is beamed.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9910553,astro-ph,"The volume around the SN 1987A contains a variety of structures, not just the three rings glowing in recombination lines. Many of these are revealed by light echoes, so are mapped in three dimensions by our optical imaging of the SN environs. The rings reside in a bipolar nebula containing them at its waist and crowns, and which is itself contained in a larger, diffuse nebula with a detectable equatorial overdensity. This diffuse nebula terminates in a denser wall which likely marks the inner edge of a bubble blown by the progenitor's main sequence wind. Along with mapping these structures, we measure spectroscopically the velocity of the gas, revealing, for instance, kinematic ages for the inner and outer rings in close agreement with each other.

Rapid X-ray variability is detected with a factor of two change in count rate within one day and 20% variability within about three hours, which practically rules out any significant contribution of scattered X-rays. We present for the first time a detailed, self-consistent modeling of the ROSAT PSPC and ASCA spectrum of IRAS133492438 in terms of a warm absorber including dust. It turns out that both a dust-free and a dusty single-component warm absorber fail to explain the ROSAT, ASCA, and optical data simultaneously.

astro-ph/9906167,astro-ph,"We report the detection of the 62 micron feature of crystalline water ice in emission towards the bow-shaped Herbig-Haro object HH 7. Significant amounts of far infrared continuum emission are also detected between 10 and 200 micron, so that Herbig-Haro objects cease to be pure emission-line objects at FIR wavelengths. The formation of crystalline water ice mantles requires grain temperatures T > 100 K at the time of mantle formation, suggesting that we are seeing material processed by the HH 7 shock front. The deduced ice mass is \~2e-5 solar masses corresponding to a water column density N~ 1e18 cm-3; an estimate of the [H2O]/[H] abundance yields values close to the interstellar gas-phase oxygen abundance. The relatively high dust temperature and the copious amounts of gas-phase water needed to produce the observed quantity of crystalline water ice, suggest a scenario where both dissociative and non-dissociative shocks co-exist. The timescale for ice mantle formation is of the order of ~400 years, so that the importance of gas-phase water cooling as a shock diagnostic may be greatly diminished.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9907299,astro-ph,"The thermodynamics of the diffuse, X-ray emitting gas in clusters of galaxies is linked to the entropy level of the intra cluster medium. In particular, models that successfully reproduce the properties of local X-ray clusters and groups require the presence of a minimum value for the entropy in the center of X-ray halos. Such a minimum entropy is most likely generated by non-gravitational processes, in order to produce the observed break in self-similarity of the scaling relations of X-ray halos. At present there is no consensus on the level, the source or the time evolution of this excess entropy. In this paper we describe a strategy to investigate the physics of the heating processes acting in groups and clusters. We show that the best way to extract information from the local data is the observation of the entropy profile at large radii in nearby X-ray halos (z~0.1), both at the upper and lower extremes of the cluster mass scale. The spatially and spectrally resolved observation of such X-ray halos provides information on the mechanism of the heating. We demonstrate how measurements of the size of constant entropy (adiabatic) cores in clusters and groups can directly constrain heating models, and the minimum entropy value. We also consider two specific experiments: the detection of the shock fronts expected at the virial boundary of rich clusters, and the detection of the isentropic, low surface-brightness emission extending to radii larger than the virial ones in low mass clusters and groups. Such observations will be a crucial probe of both the physics of clusters and the relationship of non-gravitational processes to the thermodynamics of the intergalactic medium.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9908099,astro-ph,"We study the internal response of a galaxy to an unbound encounter and present a survey of orbital parameters covering typical encounters in different galactic environments. Overall, we conclude that relatively weak encounters by low-mass interloping galaxies can cause observable distortions in the primaries. The resulting asymmetries may persist long after the interloper is evident. We focus our attention on the production of structure in dark halos and in cluster ellipticals. Any distortion produced in a dark halo can distort the embedded stellar disk, possibly leading to the formation of lopsided and warped disks. Features excited in an elliptical are directly observable and we predict that asymmetries in the morphologies of these systems can be produced by relatively small perturbers. We use these detailed results to predict the distribution of the equation parameter defined by Abraham et al. and the shift between the center of mass of the primary system and the position of the peak of density for a range of environments. We find that high-density, low-velocity dispersion environments are more likely to host galaxies with significant asymmetries. Our distribution for the equation parameter is in good agreement with the range spanned by the observed values for local galaxy clusters and for distant galaxies in the MDS and in the HDF.Finally, we propose a generalized asymmetry parameter equation which provides detailed information on the radial structure of the asymmetry produced by the mechanism explored in our work.

The `virtual maps' resulting from this model can be compared with observed maps to obtain estimates for a range of source properties from the model. These properties include parameters describing the gas density distribution of the source environment, the energy transport rate of the jets and the orientation angle of the source jet axis with respect to the line of sight. The model is tested using radio maps of Cygnus A for which there are independent measurements of some of these parameters available in the literature. The model estimates agree well with these observations. Varying the resolution of the radio maps used in thecomparison does not change the results significantly.",1999,[],5

We discuss the selection criteria of the resulting `7CQ' sample of radio-loud quasars.

astro-ph/9902243,astro-ph,"Observed spectra of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and luminous X-ray binaries in our Galaxy suggest that both hot (~109 K) and cold (~106 K) plasma components exist close to the central accreting black hole. Hard X-ray component of the spectra is usually explained by Compton upscattering of optical/UV photons from optically thick cold plasma by hot electrons. Observations also indicate that some of these objects are quite efficient in converting gravitational energy of accretion matter into radiation. Existing theoretical models have difficulties in explaining the two plasma components and high intensity of hard X-rays. Most of the models assume that the hot component emerges from the cold one due to some kind of instability, but no one offers a satisfactory physical explanation for this. Here we propose a solution to these difficulties that reverses what was imagined previously: in our model the hot component forms first and afterward it cools down to form the cold component. In our model, accretion flow has initially a small angular momentum, and thus it has a quasi-spherical geometry at large radii. Close to the black hole, the accreting matter is heated up in shocks that form due to the action of the centrifugal force. The hot post-shock matter is very efficiently cooled down by Comptonization of low energy photons and condensates into a thin and cold accretion disk. The thin disk emits the low energy photons which cool the hot component.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9910218,astro-ph,"We present the result of 27 ASCA observations of 26 radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) from the PG survey. All the RQQs were detected except 2 BALQSOs. We find the variability characteristics of the sources to be consistent with Seyf-1s. A powerlaw offers an acceptable description of the time-averaged spectra in the 2-10 keV (RQQ-frame) band for all but 1 dataset. The photon indices vary from object to object over the range 1.5~<Gamma(2-10 keV)~<3 with a mean Gamma(2-10keV)~2 and dispersion ~=0.25. The distribution of Gamma(2-10 keV is therefore similar to that observed in other RQ AGN, and seems unrelated to X-ray luminosity. No single model adequately describes the full 0.6-10 keV (obs-frame) continuum of all the RQQs. ~50% of the sources can be described by a single powerlaw (or with only very subtle deviations). All but one of the remaining datasets have convex spectra (flattening to higher energies). The exception is PG 1411442, in which a substantial column density obscures ~98% of the continuum. We find only 5 (or 6) of 14 objects with z<~0.25 to have a 'soft excess' at energies <~1 keV, but find no universal shape for these spectral components. The spectrum of PG 1244026 contains an emission feature at ~1 keV. The detection rate of absorption due to ionized material in these RQQs is lower than in Seyf-1s. In part, this may be due to selection effects. However, when detected, the absorbers in the RQQs exhibit a similar range of column density and ionization parameter as Seyf-1s. We find evidence of Fe K-shell emission in at least 8 RQQs. These are all low-luminosity objects, and the line parameters are consistent with other low-luminosity RQ AGN. However we find a trend whereby the profile and strength of the Fe K-shell emission changes as a function of luminosity.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9908049,astro-ph,"Magnetic connections to the plunging region can exert stresses on the inner edge of an accretion disk around a black hole. We recompute the relativistic corrections to the thin-disk dynamics equations when these stresses take the form of a time-steady torque on the inner edge of the disk. The additional dissipation associated with these stresses is concentrated relatively close outside the marginally stable orbit, scaling as r to the -7/2 at large radius. As a result of these additional stresses: spin-up of the central black hole is retarded; the maximum spin-equilibrium accretion efficiency is 36%, and occurs at a/M=0.94; the disk spectrum is extended toward higher frequencies; line profiles (such as Fe K-alpha) are broadened if the line emissivity scales with local flux; limb-brightening, especially at the higher frequencies, is enhanced; and the returning radiation fraction is substantially increased, up to 58%. This last effect creates possible explanations for both synchronized continuum fluctuations in AGN, and polarization rises shortward of the Lyman edge in quasars. We show that no matter what additional stresses occur, when a/M < 0.36, the second law of black hole dynamics sets an absolute upper bound on the accretion efficiency.",1999,[],5

Combining published results at other far-infrared and millimeter wavelengths with the present data, we are able to estimate the temperature of the dust, finding relatively low values, averaging 50K. From the spectral energy distribution, we derive dust masses of a few 108 Msun and luminosities of 4-33x1012 Lsun (uncorrected for any magnification) implying substantial star formation activity. Thus both the temperature and dust masses are not very different from those of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies.

(1999) and Maraschi et al. (1999), focusing on the flare of April 1998, which was simultaneously observed also at TeV energies. The detailed study of the flare in different energy bands reveals a few very important new results: (a) hard photons lag the soft ones by 2-3 ks *a behavior opposite to what is normally found in High energy peak BL Lacs X-ray spectra*; (b) the flux decay of the flare can be intrinsically achromatic if a stationary underlying emission component is present. Moreover the spectral evolution during the flare has been followed by extracting X-ray spectra on few ks intervals, allowing to detect for the first time the peak of the synchrotron component shifting to higher energies during the rising phase, and then receding. The spectral analysis confirms the delay in the flare at the higher energies, as above a few keV the spectrum changes only after the peak of the outburst has occurred. The spectral and temporal information obtained challenge the simplest models currently adopted for the (synchrotron) emission and most importantly provide clues on the particle acceleration process.

We show that a parity contribution of the gravitational waves and adiabatic density perturbations into the large-scale temperature anisotropy, T/S equation, is a common feature of equation-inflation; the maximum values of T/S (basically not larger than 10) are reached in models where (i) the local spectrum shape of density perturbations is flat or slightly red (equation), and (ii) the residual potential energy of the inflaton is near the GUT scale (equation). The conditions to find large T/S in the paradigm of cosmic inflation and the relationship of T/S to the ratio of the power spectra, equation, and to the inflationary equation and Hubble parameters, are discussed.

astro-ph/9901252,astro-ph,"What can we learn from the somewhat arduous study of old stellar populations in nearby galaxies? Unless the nearby universe is subtly anomalous, it should contain a relatively normal selection of galaxies whose histories are representative of field galaxies in general throughout the Universe. We can therefore take advantage of our ability to resolve local galaxies into individual stars to directly, and accurately, measure star formation histories. The star formation histories are determined from numerical models, based on stellar evolution tracks, of colour-magnitude diagrams. The most accurate information on star formation rates extending back to the earliest epoches can be obtained from the structure of the main sequence. However, the oldest main sequence turnoffs are very faint, and it is often necessary to use the brighter, more evolved, populations to infer the star formation history at older times. A complete star formation history can be compared with the spectroscopic properties of galaxies seen over a large range of lookback times in redshift surveys. There is considerable evidence that the faint blue galaxies seen in large numbers in cosmological surveys are the progenitors of the late-type irregular galaxies seen in copious numbers in the Local Group, and beyond. We consider how the 'Madau-diagram', the star formation history of the Universe, would look if the Local Group were to be considered representative of the Universe as a whole.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9908103,astro-ph,"Several lines of evidence suggest that cold, dense gas clouds make a substantial contribution to the total mass of dark halos. If so then physical collisions between clouds must occur; these cause strong, radiative shocks to propagate through the cold gas, with the startling implication that all 'dark' halos must be luminous. The expected luminosity is a strong function of halo velocity dispersion, and should contribute a significant fraction of the observed X-ray emission from clusters of galaxies, if dark halos are predominantly made of cold gas.   Existing data do not exclude this possibility; indeed two particular expectations of the luminous-halo model are borne out in the X-ray data, and thus give support to the cold-cloud dark matter model. First we find a luminosity-temperature correlation of the form L proportional to T to the power 11/4, as seen in recent analyses of cluster samples. Secondly the anticipated spectra have substantially more power at low energies than isothermal bremsstrahlung spectra, and might account for the observed 'excess' EUV emission seen from some clusters. The successes of the luminous-halo model are particularly remarkable because the theory has no free parameters or ad hoc elements. The model can be tested by the X-ray satellite Chandra, which should resolve the Virgo cluster into 10,000 point-like, transient X-ray sources. Non-detection of any such sources by Chandra can constrain the contribution of cold gas clouds to below 1% of the total matter density in the Universe, assuming Virgo to be representative.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9909474,astro-ph,"We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) infrared images of four gravitational lens systems from the JVAS/CLASS gravitational lens survey and compare the new infrared HST pictures with previously published WFPC2 HST optical images and radio maps. Apart from the wealth of information that we get from the flux ratios and accurate positions and separations of the components of the lens systems that we can use as inputs for better constraints on the lens models we are able to discriminate between reddening and optical/radio microlensing as the possible cause of differences observed in the flux ratios of the components across the three wavelength bands. Substantial reddening has been known to be present in the lens system B1600434 and has been further confirmed by the present infrared data. In the two systems B0712472 and B1030074 microlensing has been pinpointed down as the main cause of the flux ratio discrepancy both in the optical/infrared and in the radio, the radio possibly caused by the substructure revealed in the lensing galaxies. In B0218357 however the results are still not conclusive. If we are actually seeing the two ""true"" components of the lens system then the flux ratio differences are attributed to a combination of microlensing and reddening or alternatively due to some variability in at least one of the images. Otherwise the second ""true"" component of B0218357 maybe completely absorbed by a molecular cloud and the anomalous flux density ratios and large difference in separation between the optical/infrared and radio that we see can be explained by emission from either a foreground object or from part of the lensing galaxy.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9907036,astro-ph,"The infrared-luminous galaxy NGC3256 is a classic example of a merger induced nuclear starburst system. We find here that it is the most X-ray luminous star-forming galaxy yet detected (~1042 ergs/s). Long-slit optical spectroscopy and a deep, high-resolution ROSAT X-ray image show that the starburst is driving a ""superwind"" which accounts for ~20% of the observed soft (kT~0.3 keV) X-ray emission. Our model for the broadband X-ray emission of NGC3256 contains two additional components: a warm thermal plasma (kT~0.8 keV) associated with the central starburst, and a hard power-law component with an energy index of ~0.7. We find that the input of mechanical energy from the starburst is more than sufficient to sustain the observed level of emission. We also examine possible origins for the power-law component, concluding that neither a buried AGN nor the expected population of high-mass X-ray binaries can account for this emission. Inverse-Compton scattering, involving the galaxy's copious flux of infrared photons and the relativistic electrons produced by supernovae, is likely to make a substantial contribution to the hard X-ray flux. Such a model is consistent with the observed radio and IR fluxes and the radio and X-ray spectral indices. We explore the role of X-ray-luminous starbursts in the production of the cosmic X-ray background radiation. The number counts and spectral index distribution of the faint radio source population, thought to be dominated by star-forming galaxies, suggest that a significant fraction of the hard X-ray background could arise from starbursts at moderate redshift.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9910060,astro-ph,"We present multi-frequency radio observations from the afterglow of GRB 980519 beginning 7.2 hours after the gamma-ray burst and ending 63 days later. The fast decline in the optical and X-ray light curves for this burst has been interpreted either as afterglow emission originating from a collimated outflow -- a jet -- or the result of a blast wave propagating into a medium whose density is shaped by the wind of an evolved massive star. These two models predict divergent behavior for the radio afterglow, and therefore, radio observations are capable, in principle, of discriminating between the two. We show that a wind model describes the subsequent evolution of the radio afterglow rather well. However, we see strong modulation of the light curve, which we interpret as diffractive scintillation. These variations prevent us from decisively rejecting the jet model.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9907433,astro-ph,"We present the results from a series of two-dimensional core-collapse simulations using a rotating progenitor star. We find that the convection in these simulations is less vigorous because a) rotation weakens the core bounce which seeds the neutrino-driven convection and b) the angular momentum profile in the rotating core stabilizes against convection. The limited convection leads to explosions which occur later and are weaker than the explosions produced from the collapse of non-rotating cores. However, because the convection is constrained to the polar regions, when the explosion occurs, it is stronger along the polar axis. This asymmetric explosion can explain the polarization measurements of core-collapse supernovae. These asymmetries also provide a natural mechanism to mix the products of nucleosynthesis out into the helium and hydrogen layers of the star. We also discuss the role the collapse of these rotating stars play on the generation of magnetic fields and neutron star kicks. Given a range of progenitor rotation periods, we predict a range of supernova energies for the same progenitor mass. The critical mass for black hole formation also depends upon the rotation speed of the progenitor.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9903139,astro-ph,"The emission of 21-cm radiation from a neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) at high redshift is discussed in connection with the thermal and ionization history of the universe. The physical mechanisms that make such radiation detectable against the cosmic microwave background include Lyalpha coupling of the hydrogen spin temperature to the kinetic temperature of the gas and preheating of the IGM by the first generation of stars and quasars. Three different signatures are investigated in detail: (a) the fluctuations in the redshifted 21-cm emission induced by the gas density inhomogeneities that develop at early times in cold dark matter (CDM) dominated cosmologies; (b) the sharp absorption feature in the radio sky due to the rapid rise of the Lyalpha continuum background that marks the birth of the first UV sources in the universe; and (c) the 21-cm emission and absorption shells that are generated on several Mpc scales around the first bright quasars. Future radio observations with projected facilities like the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and the Square Kilometer Array may shed light on the power spectrum of density fluctuations at z>5, and map the end of the ""dark ages"", i.e. the transition from the post-recombination universe to one populated with radiation sources.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9906502,astro-ph,"We present ground-based images of the z=1.824 radio galaxy 3C 256 in the standard BVRIJHK filters and an interference filter centered at 8800A, a Hubble Space Telescope image in a filter dominated by Ly-alpha emission (F336W), and spectra covering rest-frame wavelengths from Ly-alpha to [O III] 5007. Together with published polarimetry observations, we use these to decompose the overall spectral energy distribution into nebular continuum emission, scattered quasar light, and stellar emission. The nebular continuum and scattered light together comprise half (one third) of the V-band (K-band) light within a 4-arcsec aperture, and are responsible for the strong alignment between the optical/near-infrared light and the radio emission. The stellar emission is dominated by a population estimated to be 100-200 Myr old (assuming a Salpeter IMF), and formed in a short burst with a peak star formation rate of 1-4x103 Msun/yr. The total stellar mass is estimated to be no more than 2x1011 Msun, which is far less than other luminous radio galaxies at similar redshifts, and suggests that 3C 256 will undergo further star formation or mergers.",1999,[],5

In combination with published optical and ultraviolet spectra, we have used these data to assemble the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the galaxy's nucleus. Interestingly, the SED of NGC 4395 differs markedly from the SEDs of both quasars and typical low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, which may be a manifestation of the different physical conditions (i.e., black hole masses, accretion rates, and/or accretion modes) that exist in these objects. The nuclear X-ray source in NGC 4395 is variable and has an observed luminosity of just ~ 1038 ergs/s.

In this paper we present a neural network based estimator system which performs well the frequency extraction in unevenly sampled signals. It uses an unsupervised Hebbian nonlinear neural algorithm to extract, from the interpolated signal, the principal components which, in turn, are used by the MUSIC frequency estimator algorithm to extract the frequencies.

astro-ph/9910030,astro-ph,"A recent observation with the Hipparcos satellite and some numerical simulations imply that the interaction between an oblate halo and a disc is inappropriate for the persistence of galactic warps. Then, we have compared the time evolution of galactic warps in a prolate halo with that in an oblate halo. The haloes were approximated as fixed potentials, while the discs were represented by N-body particles. We have found that the warping in the oblate halo continues to wind up, and finally disappears. On the other hand, for the prolate halo model, the precession rate of the outer disc increases when the precession of the outer disc recedes from that of the inner disc, and vice versa. Consequently, the warping in the prolate halo persisted to the end of the simulation by retaining the alignment of the line of nodes of the warped disc. Therefore, our results suggest that prolate haloes could sustain galactic warps. The physical mechanism of the persistence of warp is discussed on the basis of the torque between a halo and a disc and that between the inner and outer regions of the disc.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9910059,astro-ph,"We have carried out a study to simulate distant clusters of galaxies in deep ground-based optical images.

In typical conditions of equation 1-arcsec seeing, the combination of confusion and incompleteness causes a considerable underestimation of the true surface density of equation galaxies. We argue that the actual surface density of equation galaxies may be several times greater than that estimated by previous ground-based studies, consistent with the surface density of such objects found in the HDF.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9908304,astro-ph,"The cosmic infrared background (CIB) radiation is the cosmic repository for energy release throughout the history of the universe. Using the all-sky data from the COBE DIRBE instrument at wavelengths 1.25 - 100 mic we attempt to measure the CIB fluctuations. In the near-IR, foreground emission is dominated by small scale structure due to stars in the Galaxy. There we find a strong correlation between the amplitude of the fluctuations and Galactic latitude after removing bright foreground stars. Using data outside the Galactic plane (equation) and away from the center (equation) we extrapolate the amplitude of the fluctuations to cosecequation. We find a positive intercept of equation nW/m2/sr at 1.25, 2.2,3.5 and 4.9 mic respectively, where the errors are the range of 92% confidence limits. For color subtracted maps between band 1 and 2 we find the isotropic part of the fluctuations at equation nW/m2/sr. Based on detailed numerical and analytic models, this residual is not likely to originate from the Galaxy, our clipping algorithm, or instrumental noise. We demonstrate that the residuals from the fit used in the extrapolation are distributed isotropically and suggest that this extra variance may result from structure in the CIB. For equation, a power-spectrum analysis yields firm upper limits of equation 6, 2.5, 0.8, 0.5 nW/m2/sr at 1.25, 2.2, 3.5 and 4.9 mic respectively.

We then review the current theories of protoplanet migration in the context of these models, focusing on the gaseous disk-protoplanet tidal interaction. According to these theories, the migration timescale may be shorter than the planetary formation timescale.

The global ASCA and ROSAT spectra imply a cooling rate of 214 (100,-91) equation yrequation. The PSPC X-ray surface brightness profile and the ASCA data suggest a somewhat higher cooling rate. We determine the gravitational mass and gas mass as a function of radius. The total gravitating mass within 1.2 Mpc is equation equation, of which 20% is in the form of hot gas. There is a region of elevated temperature 1.5-5 arcmin to the west of the cluster center. The south-southwest region of the cluster also shows excess emission in the ROSAT PSPC X-ray image, aligned with the major axis of the optical cD galaxy in the center of the cluster.

astro-ph/9907031,astro-ph,"We propose a new instrumental concept for long-baseline optical single-mode interferometry using integrated optics which were developed for telecommunication. Visible and infrared multi-aperture interferometry requires many optical functions (spatial filtering, beam combination, photometric calibration, polarization control) to detect astronomical signals at very high angular resolution. Since the 80's, integrated optics on planar substrate have become available for telecommunication applications with multiple optical functions like power dividing, coupling, multiplexing, etc. We present the concept of an optical / infrared interferometric instrument based on this new technology. The main advantage is to provide an interferometric combination unit on a single optical chip. Integrated optics are compact, provide stability, low sensitivity to external constrains like temperature, pressure or mechanical stresses, no optical alignment except for coupling, simplicity and intrinsic polarization control. The integrated optics devices are inexpensive compared to devices that have the same functionalities in bulk optics. We think integrated optics will fundamentally change single-mode interferometry. Integrated optics devices are in particular well-suited for interferometric combination of numerous beams to achieve aperture synthesis imaging or for space-based interferometers where stability and a minimum of optical alignments are wished.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9907232,astro-ph,"If a gamma ray burst with strong UV emission occurs in a molecular cloud, there will be observable consequences resulting from excitation of the surrounding H2. The UV pulse from the GRB will pump H2 into vibrationally-excited levels which produce strong absorption at wavelengths < 1650 A. As a result, both the prompt flash and later afterglow will exhibit strong absorption shortward of 1650 A, with specific spectroscopic features. Such a cutoff in the emission from GRB 980329 may already have been observed by Fruchter et al.; if so, GRB 980329 was at redshift 3.0 < z < 4.4 . BVRI photometry of GRB 990510 could also be explained by H2 absorption if GRB 990510 is at redshift 1.6 < z < 2.3. The fluorescence accompanying the UV pumping of the H2 will result in UV emission from the GRB which can extend over days or months, depending on parameters of the ambient medium and beaming of the GRB flash. The 7.5-13.6 eV fluorescent luminosity is \sim 1041.7 erg/s for standard estimates of the parameters of the GRB and the ambient medium.

astro-ph/9908114,astro-ph,"We compare the central mass concentration of Cold Dark Matter halos found in cosmological N-body simulations with constraints derived from the Milky Way disk dynamics and from the Tully-Fisher relation. For currently favored values of the cosmological parameters (equation; equation; equation; COBE- and cluster abundance-normalized equation; Big-Bang nucleosynthesis equation), we find that halos with circular velocities comparable to the rotation speed of the Galaxy have typically \it three times more dark matter inside the solar circle than inferred from observations of Galactic dynamics. Such high central concentrations of dark matter on the scale of galaxy disks also imply that stellar mass-to-light ratios much lower than expected from population synthesis models must be assumed in order to reproduce the zero-point of the Tully-Fisher relation. Indeed, even under the extreme assumption that \it all baryons in a dark halo are turned into stars, disks with conventional equation-band stellar mass-to-light ratios (equation) are about two magnitudes fainter than observed at a given rotation speed. We examine several modifications to the equationCDM model that may account for these discrepancies and conclude that agreement can only be accomplished at the expense of renouncing other major successes of the model. Reproducing the observed properties of disk galaxies thus appears to demand substantial revision to the currently most successful model of structure formation.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9906164,astro-ph,"A theory is developed for the dynamics of eccentric perturbations equation of a disk galaxy residing in a spherical dark matter halo and including a spherical bulge component. The disk is represented as a large number equation of rings with shifted centers and with perturbed azimuthal matter distributions. Account is taken of the dynamics of the shift of the matter at the galaxy's center which may include a massive black hole. The gravitational interactions between the rings and between the rings and the center is fully accounted for, but the halo and bulge components are treated as passive gravitational field sources. Equations of motion and a Lagrangian are derived for the ring  center system, and these lead to total energy and total angular momentum constants of the motion. We study the eccentric dynamics of a disk with an exponential surface density distribution represented by a large number of rings. The inner part of the disk is found to be strongly unstable. Angular momentum of the rings is transferred outward and to the central mass if present, and a trailing one-armed spiral wave is formed in the disk. We also analyze a disk with a modified exponential density distribution where the density of the inner part of the disk is reduced. In this case we find much slower, linear growth of the eccentric motion. A trailing one-armed spiral wave forms in the disk and becomes more tightly wrapped as time increases. The motion of the central mass if present is small compared with that of the disk.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9904046,astro-ph,"This paper summarises an investigation of the statistical properties of orbits escaping from three different two-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian systems which exhibit global stochasticity. Each H=H0eH', with H0 integrable and eH' a nonintegrable correction, not necessarily small. For e below a critical e0 escapes are impossible energetically. For somewhat higher values, escape is allowed energetically but many orbits never escape and the escape probability P for a generic orbit ensemble decays exponentially. At or near a critical e1>e0, there is an abrupt qualitative change in behaviour. Above e1, P typically exhibits (1) a rapid evolution towards a nonzero P0(e) followed by (2) a much slower subsequent decay towards zero which, in at least one case, is well fit by a power law P=const x tm, with m=0.35-0.40. In all three cases, P0 and the time T required to converge towards P0 scales in e-e1, i.e., P0=const x (e-e1)a and T=const x (e-e1)b, and T also scales in the size r of the region sampled for initial conditions, i.e., T=const x r-d. To within statistical uncertainties, the best fit values of the critical exponents are the same for all three potentials, namely: a=0.5, b=0.4, and d=0.1, and satisfy a-b-d=0. The transitional behaviour observed near e1 is attributed to the breakdown of some especially significant KAM tori or cantori.

The data show polarization evolution of several spectral features at levels from 0.5% to above 4%. The observed line polarization is intrinsic to the supernovae and not of interstellar origin. These data suggest that the the distribution of ejected matter is highly aspherical. In the case of SN 1998S, the minimum major to minor axis ratio must be larger than 2.5 to 1 if the polarization is 3% from an oblate spheroidal ejecta seen edge on. A well-defined symmetry axis can be deduced from spectropolarimetry for the peculiar Type IIn supernova SN 1998S but the Type IIB events SN 1993J and SN 1996cb seem to possess much more complicated geometries with polarization position angles showing larger irregular variations across spectral features; the latter may be associated with large scale clumpiness of the ejecta. The observed degree of polarization of the Type Ic SN 1997X is above 5%. The data reveal a trend that the degree of polarization increases with decreasing envelope mass and with the depth within the ejecta. We speculate that Type IIB, Type Ib, and Type Ic may be very similar events viewed from different aspect angles.   The high axial ratio of the ejecta is difficult to explain in terms of the conventional neutrino driven core-collapse models for Type II explosions. Highly asymmetric explosion mechanisms such as the formation of bipolar jets during core-collapse may be a necessary ingredient for models of all core-collapse supernovae.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9907360,astro-ph,"Since the discovery of kHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) in neutron star binaries, the difference between peak frequencies of two modes in the upper part of the spectrum, i.e. Delta (omega)=omegah-omegaK has been studied extensively. The idea that the difference Delta(omega) is constant and (as a beat frequency) is related to the rotational frequency of the neutron star has been tested previously. The observed decrease of Delta(omega) when omegah and omegak increase has weakened the beat frequency interpretation. We put forward a different paradigm: a Keplerian oscillator under the influence of the Coriolis force. For such an oscillator, omegah and the assumed Keplerian frequency omegak hold an upper hybrid frequency relation: omega2h-omega2K=4*Omega2, where Omega is the rotational frequency of the star's magnetosphere near the equatorial plane. For three sources (Sco X-1, 4U 1608-52 and 4U 1702-429), we demonstrate that the solid body rotation Omega=Omega0=const. is a good first order approximation. Within the second order approximation, the slow variation of Omega as a function of omegaK reveals the structure of the magnetospheric differential rotation. For Sco X-1, the QPO have frequencies approximately 45 and 90 Hz which we interpret as the 1st and 2nd harmonics of the lower branch of the Keplerian oscillations for the rotator with vector Omega not aligned with the normal of the disk: omegaL/2 pi=(Omega/pi)(omegaK/omegah)sin(delta) where delta is the angle between vector Omega and the vector normal to the disk.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9904336,astro-ph,"Characterizing the shape and evolution of pulsar radio emission beams is important for understanding the observed emission. The various attempts by earlier workers investigating beam shapes have resulted in widely different conclusions. Using a carefully selected subset of the recently published multifrequency polarimetry observations of 300 radio pulsars (Gould & Lyne, 1998), we attempt to model the shape of pulsar beams. Assuming that the beam shape is elliptical, in general, and that it may depend on the angle between the rotation and the magnetic axes, we seek a consistent model where we also solve for the dependence of the beam size on frequency. From the six-frequency data on conal triple and multiple component profiles, we show that a) the pulsar emission beams follow a nested cone structure with at least three distinct cones, although only one or more of the cones may be active in a given pulsar; b) each emission cone is illuminated in the form of an annular ring of width typically about 20% of the cone radius.   Although some slight preference is evident for a model where the beam is circular for an aligned rotator & latitudinally compressed for an orthogonal rotator, the possibility that the beam shape is circular at all inclinations is found to be equally consistent with the data. While the overall size scales as equation (where equation is the pulsar period) as expected from the notion of dipolar open field lines, we see no evidence in support of the beam shape evolution with pulsar period.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9902026,astro-ph,"We add 20, 6 and 3.6 cm wavelength VLA observations of two WATs, 1231674 and 1433553, to existing VLA data at 6 and 20 cm, in order to study the variations of spectral index as a function of position. We apply the spectral tomography process that we introduced in our analysis of 3C67, 3C190 and 3C449. Both spectral tomography and polarization maps indicate that there are two distinct extended components in each source. As in the case of 3C449, we find that each source has a flat spectrum jet surrounded by a steeper spectrum sheath. The steep components tend to be more highly polarized than the flat components. We discuss a number of possibilities for the dynamics of the jet/sheath systems, and the evolution of their relativistic electron populations. While the exact nature of these two coaxial components is still uncertain, their existence requires new models of jets in FR I sources and may also have implications for the dichotomy between FR Is and FR IIs.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9903304,astro-ph,"The hydrodynamics of a variant of classical Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion is investigated: a totally absorbing sphere moves at various Mach numbers (3 and 10) relative to a medium, which is taken to be an ideal gas having a density gradient (of 3%, 20% or 100% over one accretion radius) perpendicular to the relative motion. Similarly to the 3D models published previously, both with velocity gradients and without, the models with a density gradient presented here exhibit non-stationary flow patterns, although the Mach cone remains fairly stable. The accretion rates of mass, linear and angular momenta do not fluctuate as strongly as published previously for 2D models. No obvious trend of the dependency of mass accretion rate fluctuations on the density gradient can be discerned. The average specific angular momentum accreted is roughly between zero and 70% of the total angular momentum available in the accretion cylinder in the cases where the average is prograde. Due to the large fluctuations during accretion, the average angular momentum of some models is retrograde by up to 25%. Small gradients hardly influence the average accretion rates as compared to accretion from a homogeneous medium, while very large ones succeed to dominate and form an accretion flow in which the sense of rotation is not inverted.",1999,[],5

In particular, we are successful in reproducing the properties of the LBG DSF 2237116 C2 with a model describing a young equation spheroid.

astro-ph/9904332,astro-ph,"We use a new fiber spectroscopic survey of 12 nearby, poor groups of galaxies to examine the dynamics and evolution of galaxies in these common, but poorly studied, environments. Some of our conclusions are: (1) The nine groups in our sample with diffuse X-ray emission are in fact bound systems with at least 20-50 group members with absolute magnitudes as faint as MB ~ -14  5 log h. (2) Galaxies in each X-ray-detected group have not all merged together because a significant fraction of the group mass lies outside of the galaxies and in a common halo, thereby reducing the rate of galaxy-galaxy interactions. (3) The similarity of the recent star formation histories and the fraction of early type galaxies in some poor groups to those in rich clusters suggests that cluster-specific environmental effects may not play a dominant role in the recent evolution of cluster galaxies. The evolution of group and cluster members may be driven instead by galaxy-galaxy interactions, which are likely to occur with equal frequency in field groups and in groups that have recently fallen into clusters (i.e., subclusters).",1999,[],5

They have found that such arcs would be expected far less frequently than observed (by an order of magnitude) in the currently favored model for the universe, with a large cosmological constant equation. Here we analyze whether including the effect of cluster galaxies on the likelihood of clusters to generate long-arc images of background galaxies can change the statistics. Taking into account a variety of constraints on the properties of cluster galaxies, we find that there are not enough sufficiently massive galaxies in a cluster for them to significantly enhance the cross section of clusters to generate long arcs. We find that cluster galaxies typically enhance the cross section by only equation.",1999,[],5

Seven simulations in large boxes for five cosmological models with COBE normalized CDM-like power spectra are studied. The wall-like Super Large Scale Structure with parameters similar to the observed one is found for the OCDM and LCDM models with Omegam h = 0.3 & 0.245. In these simulations, the rich structure elements with a typical value for the largest extension of \~(30 - 50) h-1 Mpc incorporate ~40% of matter with overdensity of about 10 above the mean. These rich elements are formed due to the anisotropic nonlinear compression of sheets with original size of ~(15 - 25) h-1 Mpc. They surround low-density regions with a typical diameter ~(50 - 70) h-1 Mpc.   The statistical characteristics of these structures are found to be approximately consistent with observations and theoretical expectations. The cosmological models with higher matter density letterm=1 in CDM with Harrison-Zeldovich or tilted power spectra cannot reproduce the characteristics of the observed galaxy distribution due to the very strong disruption of the rich structure elements.

astro-ph/9904132,astro-ph,"The evolution of rotating stars with zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) masses in the range 8 to 25 Msun is followed through all stages of stable evolution. The initial angular momentum is chosen such that the star's equatorial rotational velocity on the ZAMS ranges from zero to ~ 70 % of break-up. Redistribution of angular momentum and chemical species are then followed as a consequence of rotationally induced circulation and instablities. The effects of the centrifugal force on the stellar structure are included. Uncertain mixing efficiencies are gauged by observations. We find, as noted in previous work, that rotation increases the helium core masses and enriches the stellar envelopes with products of hydrogen burning. We determine, for the first time, the angular momentum distribution in typical presupernova stars along with their detailed chemical structure. Angular momentum loss due to (non-magnetic) stellar winds and the redistribution of angular momentum during core hydrogen burning are of crucial importance for the specific angular momentum of the core. Neglecting magnetic fields, we find angular momentum transport from the core to the envelope to be unimportant after core helium burning. We obtain specific angular momenta for the iron core and overlaying material of 1E16...1E17 erg s. These values are insensitive to the initial angular momentum. They are small enough to avoid triaxial deformations of the iron core before it collapses, but could lead to neutron stars which rotate close to break-up. They are also in the range required for the collapsar model of gamma-ray bursts. The apparent discrepancy with the measured rotation rates of young pulsars is discussed.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9903187,astro-ph,"Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) have remained a puzzle for many high-energy astrophysicists since their discovery in 1967. With the advent of the X-ray satellites BeppoSAX and RossiXTE, it has been possible to carry out deep multi-wavelength observations of the counterparts associated with the GRBs just within a few hours of occurence, thanks to the observation of the fading X-ray emission that follows the more energetic gamma-ray photons once the GRB event has ended. The fact that this emission (the afterglow) extends at longer wavelengths, has led to the discovery of the first optical/IR/radio counterparts in 1997-98, greatly improving our understanding of these sources. Now it is widely accepted that GRBs originate at cosmological distances but while the observed afterglow satisfies the predictions of the relativistic fireball models, the central engines that power these extraordinary events remain still unknown.

astro-ph/9908251,astro-ph,"We have investigated the properties of the stellar mass function in the globular cluster NGC6397 using a large set of HST observations that include WFPC2 images in V and I, obtained at ~4' and 10' radial distances, and a series of deep images in the J and H bands obtained with the NIC2 and NIC3 cameras of NICMOS pointed to regions located ~4.5' and ~3.2' from the center. These observations span the region from ~1 to ~3 times the cluster's half-light radius. All luminosity functions, derived from color magniutde diagrams, increase with decreasing luminosity up to a peak at MI~8.5 or MH~7 and then precipitously drop well before photometric incompleteness becomes significant. Within the observational uncertainties, at MI~12 or MH~10.5 (~0.09 Msun) the luminosity functions are compatible with zero. By applying the best available mass- luminosity relation appropriate to the metallicity of NGC6397 to both the optical and IR data, we obtain a mass function that shows a break in slope at \~0.3 Msun. No single exponent power-law distribution is compatible with these data, regardless of the value of the exponent. We find that a dynamical model of the cluster can simultaneously reproduce all the luminosity functions observed throughout the cluster only if the IMF rises as m**-1.6 in the range 0.8-0.3 Msun and then drops as m**0.2 below ~0.3 Msun.

astro-ph/9910174,astro-ph,"I demonstrate that the two unexpected results in the local Universe: 1) anomalous intrinsic (V-I)0 colors of the clump giants and RR Lyrae stars in the Galactic center, and 2) very short distances to the Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC) as inferred from clump giants, are connected with each other. The (V-I)0 anomaly is partially resolved by using the photometry from the phase-II of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) rather than phase-I. The need for V- or I-magnitude-based change in the bulge (V-I)0 is one option to explain the remaining color discrepancy. Such change may originate in a coefficient of selective extinction AV/E(V-I) smaller than typically assumed. Application of the (V-I)0 correction (independent of its source) doubles the slope of the absolute magnitude - metallicity relation for clump giants, so that MI(RC) = -0.23  0.19[Fe/H]. Consequently, the estimates of the clump distances to the LMC and SMC are affected. Udalski's (1998c) distance modulus of muLMC = 18.18 /- 0.06 increases to muLMC = 18.27 /- 0.07.

This result is hard to reconcile with suggestions that the bulk of the emission is simple quasi-blackbody, cooling radiation from an isolated neutron star. Furthermore, archived EINSTEIN and ROSAT datasets spanning 18 years confirm that this source manifests long-term variability, to a lesser degree. This provides a natural explanation for difficulties encountered in reproducing the original EINSTEIN detection of 1E 161348-5055.

The loose aggregates have a hierarchical structure in both space and time that resembles interstellar turbulence, suggesting that these stars form in only a few turbulent crossing times with positions that map out the previous gas distribution. Dense clusters, on the other hand, are often well mixed, as if self-gravitational motion has erased the initial fine structure. Nevertheless, some of the youngest dense clusters also show sub-clumping, so it may be that all stellar clustering is related to turbulence. Some of the densest clusters may also be triggered. The evidence for mass segregation of the stars inside clusters is reviewed, along with various explanations for this effect. Other aspects of the theory of cluster formation are reviewed as well, including many specific proposals for cluster formation mechanisms. The conditions for the formation of bound clusters are discussed. Critical star formation efficiencies can be as low as 10% if the gas removal process is slow and the stars are born at sub-virial speeds.

Three spectra of this prototypical Seyfert 2 galaxy were obtained through a 12 arcsec diameter aperture centered on different locations near the nucleus. The first pointing (A1) was centered west of the optical nucleus; the nucleus was on the eastern edge of the aperture. The second (A2) was centered southwest of the optical nucleus with the nucleus well inside the aperture. The third (B) was centered on the ionization cone, with the nucleus on the southwestern edge of the aperture. While all three aperture locations have spectra similar to the Astro-1 observations of Kriss et al., these new spatially resolved observations localize the source of the far-UV line and continuum emission. The ionization cone (B) has both brighter emission lines and continuum than the nucleus (A2). A1 is fainter than either A2 or B in both lines and continuum. The far-UV emission lines observed with HUT have a spatial distribution that most similar to [O III] 5007, but appear to be more extended and offset to the northeast along the axis of the radio jet. This supports the previous conclusion of Kriss et al. that the bright C III 977 and N III 991 arises in shock-heated gas. The UV continuum radiation has a more extended spatial distribution than the line-emitting gas. At wavelengths longward of 1200 A the inferred continuum distribution is consistent with that seen in archival HST/WFPC2 F218W images, and it appears to contain a substantial contribution from starlight.

astro-ph/9901338,astro-ph,"According to the internal-external shocks model for equation-ray bursts (GRBs), the GRB is produced by internal shocks within a relativistic flow while the afterglow is produced by external shocks with the ISM. We explore the early afterglow emission. For short GRBs the peak of the afterglow will be delayed, typically, by few dozens of seconds after the burst. For long GRBs the early afterglow emission will overlap the GRB signal. We calculate the expected spectrum and the light curves of the early afterglow in the optical, X-ray and equation-ray bands. These characteristics provide a way to discriminate between late internal shocks emission (part of the GRB) and the early afterglow signal. If such a delayed emission, with the characteristics of the early afterglow, will be detected it can be used both to prove the internal shock scenario as producing the GRB, as well as to measure the initial Lorentz factor of the relativistic flow. The reverse shock, at its peak, contains energy which is comparable to that of the GRB itself, but has a much lower temperature than that of the forward shock so it radiates at considerably lower frequencies. The reverse shock dominates the early optical emission, and an optical flash brighter than 15th magnitude, is expected together with the forward shock peak at x-rays or equation-rays. If this optical flash is not observed, strong limitations can be put on the baryonic contents of the relativistic shell deriving the GRBs, leading to a magnetically dominated energy density.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9901069,astro-ph,"This paper concentrates on four key tools for performing star cluster simulations developed during the last decade which are sufficient to handle all the relevant dynamical aspects. First we discuss briefly the Hermite integration scheme which is simple to use and highly efficient for advancing the single particles. The main numerical challenge is in dealing with weakly and strongly perturbed hard binaries. A new treatment of the classical Kustaanheimo-Stiefel two-body regularization has proved to be more accurate for studying binaries than previous algorithms based on divided differences or Hermite integration. This formulation employs a Taylor series expansion combined with the Stumpff functions, still with one force evaluation per step, which gives exact solutions for unperturbed motion and is at least comparable to the polynomial methods for large perturbations. Strong interactions between hard binaries and single stars or other binaries are studied by chain regularization which ensures a non-biased outcome for chaotic motions. A new semi-analytical stability criterion for hierarchical systems has been adopted and the long-term effects on the inner binary are now treated by averaging techniques for cases of interest. These modifications describe consistent changes of the orbital variables due to large Kozai cycles and tidal dissipation.

astro-ph/9907358,astro-ph,"In the standard picture of isolated star formation, dense 'starless' cores are formed out of magnetic molecular clouds due to ambipolar diffusion. Under the simplest spherical geometry, I demonstrate that 'starless' cores formed this way naturally exhibit a large scale inward motion, whose size and speed are comparable to those detected recently by Taffala et al. and Williams et al. in 'starless' core L1544. My model clouds have a relatively low mass (of order 10 equation) and low field strength (of order 10 equationG) to begin with. They evolve into a density profile with a central plateau surrounded by a power-law envelope, as found previously. The density in the envelope decreases with radius more steeply than those found by Mouschovias and collaborators for the more strongly magnetized, disk-like clouds.   At high enough densities, dust grains become dynamically important by greatly enhancing the coupling between magnetic field and the neutral cloud matter. The trapping of magnetic flux associated with the enhanced coupling leads, in the spherical geometry, to a rapid assemblage of mass by the central protostar, which exacerbates the so-called 'luminosity problem' in star formation.",1999,[],5

The X-ray emission most likely originates from the eclipsing binary itself, rather than from the other visual component of the system. The X-ray light curves could be modulated with the orbital period of the eclipsing binary, with a hint for a different orbital modulation of the cooler and hotter plasma. The X-ray spectrum is characterized by hot plasma, with the Fe K complex at 6.7 keV clearly detected in the MECS spectrum, and it is well fitted by a 2-temperature optically thin plasma model with low metal abundances (equation).

The scatter around the FP is similar for all six clusters. We find that the slope of the FP for the intermediate redshift clusters is slightly different from the one found for the Coma cluster and other nearby clusters. This may either be caused by selection effects for the intermediate redshift clusters or by differences in the evolution of low luminosity galaxies and high luminosity galaxies. The mass-to-light (M/L) ratios, as measured from the FP, change with redshift. Using the data for all five intermediate redshift clusters, we find that the M/L ratios for photometry calibrated to Gunn r change with redshift as Delta log M/Lr = (-0.26-0.06) Delta z for q0=0.5. This is consistent with the previously published analysis for CL002416, CL135862 and MS2053-04. For q0=0.5 the results are consistent with passive evolution of a stellar population which formed at a redshift larger than five. For q0=0.15 the formation redshift must be larger than 1.7. Our new data for A665 and A2218 confirm the gradual and slow evolution of the bright E and S0 galaxies. However, possible star formation in E and S0 galaxies during the last 3-4 Gyr of the history of the Universe, as well as the selection effects complicate the interpretation of the data.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9901229,astro-ph,"The large-scale gradient of the interstellar medium (ISM) density distribution essentially affects the evolution of Supernova remnants (SNRs). In a non-uniform ISM, the shape of SNR becomes essentially non-spherical, and distributions of gas parameters inside the remnant become strongly anisotropic. The well-known self-similar Sedov solutions may not be applied to modelling such non-spherical objects. Therefore we propose a new approximate analytical method for full hydrodynamical description of 3D point-like explosions in non-uniform media with arbitrary density distribution. On the basis of this method, we investigate the general properties of evolution of 2D non-spherical adiabatic SNRs in ISM with large-scale density gradient. It is shown that the real shape of adiabatic SNR becomes more non-spherical with age, but the visible shape remains close to spherical even for strong real asymmetry (ratio of maximal to minimal shock radii) and surface brightness contrast. It is shown also that the values of the parameters of X-ray radiation from the entire SNR (luminosity, spectral index) are close to those in the Sedov case with the same initial data. However, the surface distribution of the X-ray emission parameters is very sensitive to the initial density distribution around the SN progenitor. Therefore, the X-ray maps give important information about physical conditions inside and outside of the non-spherical SNR.",1999,[],5

Images with < 9 arcsecond (170 pc) resolution of these nearly face-on, late-type galaxies were obtained using the LW2 (6.75 mu) and LW3 (15 mu) ISOCAM filters. Though their global Inu(6.75 mu)/Inu(15 mu) flux ratios are similar and typical of normal galaxies, they show distinct trends of this color ratio with mid-infrared surface brightness. We find that Inu(6.75 mu)/Inu(15 mu) ~< 1 only occurs for regions of intense heating activity where the continuum rises at 15 micron and where PAH destruction can play an important role. The shape of the color-surface brightness trend also appears to depend, to the second-order, on the hardness of the ionizing radiation. We discuss these findings in the context of a two-component model for the phases of the interstellar medium and suggest that star formation intensity is largely responsible for the mid-infrared surface brightness and colors within normal galaxies, whereas differences in dust column density are the primary drivers of variations in the mid-infrared surface brightness between the disks of normal galaxies.",1999,[],5

A pronounced, well-defined, flare with hour-scale variability was observed simultaneously in X-rays and very high energy gamma-rays. These data provide the first evidence that the X-ray and TeV intensities are well correlated on time-scales of hours. While the rise of the flare occurred on a similar time-scale in the two wavebands, the decay of the flare was much more rapid in gamma rays, providing the first clear indication that the X-ray and gamma-ray emission may not be completely correlated in Markarian 421.",1999,[],5

If a strong beaming effect is the cause of the extreme observation properties, one would expect that these properties would be correlated with each other. Based on the relativistic beaming model, relationships between the polarization and the magnitude variation in brightness, as well as the core- dominance parameter are derived and used statistically to compare with the observational data of a BL Lacertae object sample. The statistical results are consistent with these correlations, which suggests that the polarization, the variation, and the core-dominance parameter are possible indications of the beaming effect.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9902284,astro-ph,"We present ground-based 3 micron spectra of obscured Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs). We identify the carbon stars on the basis of the 3.1 micron absorption by HCN and C2H2 molecules.   We show evidence for the existence of carbon stars up to the highest AGB luminosities (Mbol=-7 mag, for a distance modulus to the LMC of 18.7 mag). This proves that Hot Bottom Burning (HBB) cannot, in itself, prevent massive AGB stars from becoming carbon star before leaving the AGB. It also sets an upper limit to the distance modulus of the Large Magellanic Cloud of 18.8 mag.   The equivalent width of the absorption band decreases with redder (K-L) colour when the dust continuum emission becomes stronger than the photospheric emission. Carbon stars with similar (K-L) appear to have equally strong 3 micron absorption in the MCs and the Milky Way. We discuss the implications for the carbon and nitrogen enrichment of the stellar photosphere of carbon stars.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9911339,astro-ph,"We present stellar structure and atmosphere models of metal-free stars and examine them from a cosmological point of view. Metal-free stars exhibit high effective temperatures and small sizes relative to metal-enriched stars of equal mass. These unique physical characteristics enhance the ionizing photon production by metal-free stars, particularly in the He II (E > = 4 Ryd) continuum. The star formation rate of metal-free stars necessary to reionize the hydrogen in the universe by z = 5 is consistent with the inferred star formation rate at that epoch. However, the hard stellar spectra are inconsistent with the observations of He II opacity in the IGM at z ~ 3, indicating that the period of metal-free star formation ended before that epoch. We examine the effects of these stars on the ionization balance of the IGM, the radiative feedback of the first luminous objects, and the extragalactic radiation field. We comment on the prospects for detecting metal-free stellar populations with the 1640 A and 4686 A recombination lines of He II.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9910495,astro-ph,"One of the least understood aspects of white dwarf evolution is the process by which they are formed. We are aided, however, by the fact that many H- and He-deficient pre-white dwarfs (PWDs) are multiperiodic g-mode pulsators. Pulsations in PWDs provide a unique opportunity to probe their interiors, which are otherwise inaccesible to direct observation. Until now, however, the nature of the pulsation mechanism, the precise boundaries of the instability strip, and the mass distribution of the PWDs were complete mysteries. These problems must be addressed before we can apply knowledge of pulsating PWDs to improve understanding of white dwarf formation. This paper lays the groundwork for future theoretical investigations of these stars. In recent years, Whole Earth Telescope observations led to determination of mass and luminosity for the majority of the (non-central star) PWD pulsators. With these observations, we identify the common properties and trends PWDs exhibit as a class. We find that pulsators of low mass have higher luminosity, suggesting the range of instability is highly mass-dependent. The observed trend of decreasing periods with decreasing luminosity matches a decrease in the maximum (standing-wave) g-mode period across the instability strip. We show that the red edge can be caused by the lengthening of the driving timescale beyond the maximum sustainable period. This result is general for ionization-based driving mechanisms, and it explains the mass-dependence of the red edge. The observed form of the mass-dependence provides a vital starting point for future theoretical investigations of the driving mechanism. We also show that the blue edge probably remains undetected because of selection effects arising from rapid evolution.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9902205,astro-ph,"A summary is given of the high-lights during the Reykjavik Midsummer Symposium on Non-Linear Phenomena in Accretion Discs around Black Holes. Such high-lights include the recent advances on understanding: 1) the accretion disc solution branch dominated by advection (i.e., advection dominated accretion flows, ADAFs), 2) the importance of magnetic fields in many different respects, most importantly being responsible for the self-sustained MHD-turbulence giving rise to the disc viscosity, and 3) the details of the radiation processes giving rise to the X/gamma-ray continuum originating close to the black hole. Some old advances are unfortunately also necessary to discuss here. It is pointed out to the accretion disc research community, that many of the research papers published on ADAFs 1994-1997 do not accurately present the history of ADAF research. Some of the results that were presented as new and original actually appeared in a paper by Ichimaru already in 1977. Also not quoted are the papers from the 1970's and 1980's calculating the temperature structure of and the spectra from quasi-spherical accretion flows onto black holes. As the ADAFs are close to being quasi-spherical, the resulting spectra of ADAFs and quasi-spherical flows are almost identical. Further of the recent ADAF results are therefore not new results as is sometimes claimed. In spite of all the recent progress of various aspects of accretion flows around black holes, many of the research lines have still not been merged providing potential for further dramatic progress in coming years.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9911516,astro-ph,"Quiescence and burst emission and relativistic particle winds of soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) have been widely interpreted to result from ultrastrongly magnetized neutron stars. In this magnetar model, the magnetic energy and gravitational energy of the neutron stars are suggested as the energy sources of all the emission and winds. However, Harding, Contopoulos & Kazanas (1999) have shown that the magnetic field should be only ~ 3 x 1013 G in order to match the characteristic spin-down timescale of SGR 1806-20 and its SNR age. Here we argue that if the magnetic field is indeed so weak, the previously suggested energy sources seem problematic. We further propose a plausible model in which SGR pulsars are young strange stars with superconducting cores and with a poloidal magnetic field of ~ 3 x 1013 G. In this model, the movement of the flux tubes not only leads to crustal cracking of the stars, giving rise to deconfinement of crustal matter to strange matter, but also to movement of internal magnetic toruses with the flux tubes. The former process will result in burst and quiescence emission and the latter process will produce steady relativistic winds which will power the surrounding supernova remnants.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9911364,astro-ph,"Observational aspects of solar flares relevant to the acceleration process of electrons and protons are reviewed and it is shown that most of these observations can be explained by the interaction with flare plasma of a power law energy distribution of electrons (and protons) that are injected at the top of a flaring loop, in the so-called thick target model. Some new observations that do not agree with this model are described and it is shown that these can be explained most naturally if most of the energy released by the reconnection process goes first into the generation of plasma turbulence, which accelerates, scatters and traps the ambient electrons near the top of the loop stochastically. The resultant bremsstrahlung photon spectral and spatial distributions agree with the new observations. This model is also justified by some theoretical arguments. Results from numerical evaluation of the spectra of the accelerated electrons and their bremsstrahlung emission are compared with observations and shown how one can constrain the model parameters describing the flare plasma and the spectrum and the energy density of the turbulence.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9907024,astro-ph,"The Press--Schechter, excursion set approach allows one to make predictions about the shape and evolution of the mass function of bound objects. It combines the assumption that objects collapse spherically with the assumption that the initial density fluctuations were Gaussian and small. While the predicted mass function is reasonably accurate at the high mass end, it has more low mass objects than are seen in simulations of hierarchical clustering. This discrepancy can be reduced substantially if bound structures are assumed to form from an ellipsoidal, rather than a spherical collapse. In the spherical model, a region collapses if the initial density within it exceeds a threshold value, deltasc. This value is independent of the initial size of the region, and since the mass of the collapsed object is related to its initial size, deltasc is independent of final mass. In the ellipsoidal model, the collapse of a region depends on the surrounding shear field, as well as on its initial overdensity. Therefore, there is a relation between the density threshold value required for collapse, and the mass of the final object. We provide a fitting function to this deltaec(m) relation for initially Gaussian fields which simplifies the inclusion of ellipsoidal dynamics in the excursion set approach. We discuss the relation between the excursion set predictions and the halo distribution in high resolution N-body simulations, and show that our simple parametrization of the ellipsoidal collapse model represents a significant improvement on the spherical model on an object-by-object basis. Finally, we show that the associated statistical predictions, the mass function and the large scale halo-to-mass bias relation, are also more accurate than the standard predictions.",1999,[],5

We present evidence rejecting the possibility that this line is the result of instrumental artifacts, or a serendipitous source. The most likely explanation is blueshifted Fe-K emission (the EW is 300/-200 eV, QSO frame). Bulk velocities of the order of 0.75c are implied by the data. We show that Fe-K line photons originating in an accretion disk and Compton-scattering off a leptonic can account for the emission line.

astro-ph/9912434,astro-ph,"The high stellar densities in young compact star clusters, such as the star cluster R 136 in the 30 Doradus region, may lead to a large number of stellar collisions. Such collisions were recently found to be much more frequent than previous estimates. The number of collisions scales with the number of stars for clusters with the same initial relaxation time. These collisions take place in a few million years. The collision products may finally collapse into massive black holes. The fraction of the total mass in the star cluster which ends up in a single massive object scales with the total mass of the cluster and its relaxation time. This mass fraction is rather constant, within a factor two or so.

astro-ph/9908285,astro-ph,"Long-slit spectroscopic observations of line-strengths and kinematics made along the minor axes of four spiral bulges are reported. Comparisons are made between central line-strengths in spiral bulges and those in other morphological types. The bulges are found to have central line-strengths comparable with those of single stellar populations (SSPs) of approximately solar abundance or above. Negative radial gradients are observed in line-strengths, similar to those in elliptical galaxies. The bulge data are consistent with correlations between Mg2, and central velocity dispersion observed in elliptical galaxiess. In contrast to elliptical galaxies, central line-strengths lie within the loci defining the range of <Fe> and Mg2 achieved by Worthey's (1994) solar abundance ratio, SSPs. The implication of solar abundance ratios indicates differences in the star formation histories of spiral bulges and elliptical galaxies. A 'single zone with in- fall' model of galactic chemical evolution, using Worthey's (1994) SSPs, is used to constrain possible star formation histories in our sample. We show that <Fe>, Mg2 and Hbeta line-strengths observed in these bulges cannot be reproduced using primordial collapse models of formation but can be reproduced by models with extended in-fall of gas and star formation (2-17 Gyr) in the region modelled. One galaxy (NGC 5689) shows a central population with luminosity weighted average age of ~5 Gyr, supporting the idea of extended star formation.

astro-ph/9912230,astro-ph,"This paper is the second in a series, studying the optical properties of a sample of mid-IR Warm Seyfert galaxies and a control sample of mid-IR Cold galaxies. The present paper is devoted to aperture photometry. We discuss nuclear (within the central 2 kpc) and disk optical properties and their correlations with IR properties. We find a transition in the observed optical and IR properties from the Cold to the Warm Seyfert 2 and Seyfert 1 samples, with a partial overlap between the first two. This is in the sense of: (i) increasing nuclear optical luminosities and bluer nuclear colours (ii) decreasing disk optical luminosities and sizes (iii) increasing 25 micron luminosities, decreasing far-IR excess L(IR)/L(B) and IR-loudness a(V,25) or a(V,60) and bluer a(25,60) and a(12,100) colours. We interpret these results as indicating larger dust content, and disk star formation for Seyfert 2s, while the optical properties of Seyfert 1s are mostly dominated by their nuclei. The 25 micron emission of the Warm sample is mainly due to the AGN thermal component, although in Seyfert 2s it is probably further enhanced by disk star formation. Their far-IR (60-100 micron) luminosity on the other hand, traces mainly emission at large scales (host disks). In the Cold galaxies, the bulk of IR emission at all wavelengths appears to be dominated by dust in their disks.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9901081,astro-ph,"The axisymmetric 3-D MHD outflow of a cold plasma from a magnetized and rotating astrophysical object is numerically simulated with the purpose of investigating the outflow's magnetocentrifugal acceleration and eventual collimation. Gravity and thermal pressure are neglected while a split-monopole is used to describe the initial magnetic field configuration. It is found that the stationary final state depends critically on a single parameter alpha expressing the ratio of the corotating speed at the Alfven distance to the initial flow speed along the initial monopole-like magnetic fieldlines. Several angular velocity laws have been used for relativistic and nonrelativistic outflows. The acceleration of the flow is most effective at the equatorial plane and the terminal flow speed depends linearly on alpha. Significant flow collimation is found in nonrelativistic efficient magnetic rotators corresponding to relatively larger than 1 values of alpha while very weak collimation occurs in inefficient magnetic rotators with values of alpha smaller than about 1. Part of the flow around the rotation and magnetic axis is cylindrically collimated while the remaining part obtains radial asymptotics. The transverse radius of the jet is inversely proportional to alpha while the density in the jet grows linearly with alpha. For alpha greater than about 5 the magnitude of the flow in the jet remains below the fast MHD wave speed everywhere. In relativistic outflows, no collimation is found in the supersonic region for parameters typical for radio pulsars. All above results verify the main conclusions of general theoretical studies on the magnetic acceleration and collimation of outflows from magnetic rotators and extend previous numerical simulations to large stellar distances.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9906219,astro-ph,"A recent model for the stellar initial mass function (IMF), in which the stellar masses are randomly sampled down to the thermal Jeans mass from hierarchically structured pre-stellar clouds, predicts that regions of ultra-cold CO gas, such as those recently found in nearby galaxies by Allen and collaborators, should make an abundance of Brown Dwarfs with relatively few normal stars. This result comes from the low value of the thermal Jeans mass, considering that the hierarchical cloud model always gives the Salpeter IMF slope above this lower mass limit. The ultracold CO clouds in the inner disk of M31 have T~3K and pressures that are probably 10 times higher than in the solar neighborhood. This gives a mass at the peak of the IMF equal to 0.01 Msun, well below the Brown Dwarf limit of 0.08 Msun. Using a functional approximation to the IMF, the ultracold clouds would have 50% of the star-like mass and 90% of the objects below the Brown Dwarf limit.

We assume that the universe is spatially flat, with a cosmological constant, and that structure formed from adiabatic initial fluctuations with a Harrison-Zel'dovich power spectrum. The nucleosynthesis value Omegab=0.019/h2 is adopted. We use the full three- and four- dimensional likelihood functions for each data set and marginalise these to two- and one- dimensional distributions in a Bayesian way, integrating over the other parameters. It is shown that the three data sets are in excellent agreement, with a best fit point of Omegam= 1-OmegaLambda=0.36, h=0.54, sigma8=0.74, and bIRAS=1.08. This point is within one sigma of the minimum for each data set alone.

Without invoking any asymmetry for the stellar wind and taking into account the effects of a moving central star, an asymmetric halo is formed as a consequence of the interaction with the ISM.   We found that the asymmetries caused by the interaction take place from the beginning of the evolution and have an enormous influence on the formation of the halo.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9904203,astro-ph,"As a consequence of improved S/N, spectral resolution and wavelength coverage various authors have introduced, without strong justification, new emitting regions to account for various emission line profile differences in AGN. The so-called CIVlambda1549 intermediate line region (ILR) appears to be especially ill-defined. We present observational evidence that suggests the ILR is statistically indistinguishable from the classical narrow line region (NLR). We present the results of theoretical models showing that a smooth density gradient in the NLR can produce CIV and Balmer emission lines with different widths. The putative ILR component has often been included with the broad line profile in studies of CIV BLR properties. Failure to account for the composite nature of CIV emission, and for the presence of sometimes appreciable NLR CIV emission, has important consequences for our understanding of the BLR.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9911454,astro-ph,"We have studied the parsec-scale structure of the quasar 3C345 at letterletter 1.3, 2, 3.6, and 6 cm, using total intensity and linear polarization images from 3 epochs of VLBA observations made in 1995.84, 1996.41, and 1996.81. The images show an unresolved ""core"" and a radio jet extending over distances up to 25 milliarcseconds. At 1.3 and 2 cm, images of the linearly polarized emission reveal an alignment of the electric vector with the extremely curved inner section of the jet. At 6 cm, the jet shows strong fractional polarization (m~15%), with the electric vector being oriented perpendicular to the jet. This is consistent with the existence of a transition from the shock-dominated to the plasma interaction-dominated emission regimes in the jet, occurring at a distance of ~1.5 milliarcseconds from the ""core"".",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9901047,astro-ph,"Identifications are sought for 12 sub-mm sources detected by Eales et al (1998). Six are securely identified, two have probable identifications and four remain unidentified with IAB > 25. Spectroscopic and estimated photometric redshifts indicate that four of the sources have z < 1, and four have 1 < z < 3, with the remaining four empty field sources probably lying at z > 3. The spectral energy distributions of the identifications are consistent with those of high extinction starbursts such as Arp 220. The far-IR luminosities of the sources at z > 0.5 are of order 3 x 1012 h50-2 Lsun, i.e. slightly larger than that of Arp 220. Based on this small sample, the cumulative bolometric luminosity function shows strong evolution to z ~ 1, but weaker or possibly even negative evolution beyond. The redshift dependence of the far-IR luminosity density does not appear, at this early stage, to be inconsistent with that seen in the ultraviolet luminosity density. Assuming that the energy source in the far-IR is massive stars, the total luminous output from star-formation in the Universe is probably dominated by the far-IR emission. The detected systems have individual star-formation rates (exceeding 300 h50-2 MO yr-1) that are much higher than seen in the ultraviolet selected samples, and which are sufficient to form substantial stellar populations on dynamical timescales of 108 yr. The association with merger-like morphologies and the obvious presence of dust makes it attractive to identify these systems as forming the metal-rich spheroid population, in which case we would infer that much of this activity has occurred relatively recently, at z ~ 2.",1999,[],5

With the aim of understanding such interstellar clouds better, the present study models the case of two embedded sources. A radiative transfer scheme has been developed to deal with an uniform density dust cloud in a cylindrical geometry, which includes isotropic scattering in addition to the emission and absorption processes. This scheme has been applied to the Galactic star forming region associated with IRAS 191811349, which shows observational evidence for two embedded energy sources. Two independent modelling approaches have been adopted, viz., to fit the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) best; or to fit the various radial profiles best, as a function of wavelength.

The lower mass limit is well suited for comparison with white dwarf companions of millisecond pulsars (MSP). The derived cooling ages are of the order of 109 yrs due to residual nuclear burning. The cooling ages are consistent with age estimations of MSP systems based on the pulsars' spin-down. For example, for the system PSR 10125307 we derived a white dwarf cooling age of 6 /-1 Gyr in good agreement with the spin-down age of 7 Gyr. For the companion mass we found M=0.19 /- 0.02 Msun.

This is suggested by the uniformity and extent of the haloes, given that spatial diffusion is slow and that radiative losses limit particle lifetimes. Stochastic acceleration by plasma turbulence is the most likely mechanism. Alfven wave turbulence has been suggested as the means of acceleration, but it is too slow to be important in the cluster environment. We propose, instead, that acceleration occurs via strong lower-hybrid wave turbulence.

astro-ph/9901279,astro-ph,"The interaction of the heliosphere with interstellar clouds has attracted interest since the late 1920's, both with a view to explaining apparent quasi-periodic climate ""catastrophes"" as well as periodic mass extinctions. Until recently, however, models describing the solar wind - local interstellar medium (LISM) interaction self-consistently had not been developed. Here, we describe the results of a two-dimensional (2D) simulation of the interaction between the heliosphere and an interstellar cloud with the same properties as currently, except that the neutral H density is increased from the present value of n(H) ~ 0.2 cm-3 to 10 cm-3. The mutual interaction of interstellar neutral hydrogen and plasma is included. The heliospheric cavity is reduced considerably in size (approximately 10 - 14 AU to the termination shock in the upstream direction) and is highly dynamical. The interplanetary environment at the orbit of the Earth changes markedly, with the density of interstellar H increasing to ~2 cm-3. The termination shock itself experiences periods where it disappears, reforms and disappears again. Considerable mixing of the shocked solar wind and LISM occurs due to Rayleigh-Taylor-like instabilities at the nose, driven by ion-neutral friction. Implications for two anomalously high concentrations of 10Be found in Antarctic ice cores 33 kya and 60 kya, and the absence of prior similar events, are discussed in terms of density enhancements in the surrounding interstellar cloud. The calculation presented here supports past speculation that the galactic environment of the Sun moderates the interplanetary environment at the orbit of the Earth, and possibly also the terrestrial climate.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9904025,astro-ph,"Recent observations show that the temporal decay of the R-band afterglow from GRB 990123 steepened about 2.5 days after the burst. We here propose a possible explanation for such a steepening: a shock expanding in a dense medium has undergone the transition from a relativistic phase to a nonrelativistic phase. We find that this model is consistent with the observations if the medium density is about equation. By fitting our model to the observed optical and X-ray afterglow quantitatively, we further infer the electron and magnetic energy fractions of the shocked medium and find these two parameters are about 0.1 and equation respectively. The former parameter is near the equipartition value while the latter is about six orders of magnitude smaller than inferred from the GRB 970508 afterglow. We also discuss possibilities that the dense medium can be produced.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9903236,astro-ph,"We report on observations of the field of GRB~970508 made in early August 1998, 454 days after outburst, with the STIS CCD camera onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. The images, taken in open filter (50CCD) mode, clearly reveal the presence of a galaxy which was obscured in earlier (June 1997) HST images by emission from the optical transient (OT). The galaxy is regular in shape: after correcting for the HST/STIS PSF, it is well-fitted by an exponential disk with a scale length of 0.""046 /- 0.""006 and an ellipticity of 0.70 /- 0.07. All observations are marginally consistent with a continuous decline in OT emission as t-1.3 beginning two days after outburst; however, we find no direct evidence in the image for emission from the OT, and the surface brightness profile of the galaxy is most regular if we assume that the OT emission is negligible, suggesting that the OT may have faded more rapidly at late times than is predicted by the power-law decay. Due to the wide bandwidth of the STIS clear mode, the estimated magnitude of the galaxy is dependent on the galaxy spectrum that is assumed. Using colors obtained from late-time ground-based observations to constrain the spectrum, we find V = 25.4 /- 0.15, a few tenths of a magnitude brighter than earlier ground-based estimates that were obtained by observing the total light of the galaxy and the OT and then subtracting the estimated OT brightness assuming it fades as a single power-law. This again suggests that the OT may have faded faster at late time than the power-law predicts. The position of the OT agrees with that of the isophotal center of the galaxy to 0.""01. This remarkable agreement raises the possibility that the GRB may have been associated with either an active galactic nucleus or a nuclear starburst.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9912067,astro-ph,"Candidate clusters of galaxies drawn from the sample identified from the moderately deep I-band data of the ESO Imaging Survey (EIS), have been used for follow-up optical/infrared imaging and spectroscopic observations. The observations were conducted to assess the nature of these candidates over a large range of redshifts. Currently, 163 EIS candidates have (V-I) colors, 15 have (I-K) and 65 cluster fields have been observed spectroscopically. From a preliminary analysis of these data, we find that > 65% of the candidates studied show strong evidence of being real physical associations, over the redshift range 0.2<z<1.1. The evidence in some cases comes directly from spectroscopic measurements, in others indirectly from the detection of overdensities of objects with either the same color or the same photometric redshift, or from a combination of color and spectroscopic information. Preliminary results also suggest that the redshift derived from the matched-filter algorithm is a reasonable measure of the cluster's redshift, possibly overestimating it by Delta z ~0.1, at least for systems at z<0.7. Overdensities of red objects have been detected in over 100 candidates, 38 of which with estimated redshifts >0.6, and six candidates in the interval 0.45<z<0.81 have either been identified directly from measured redshifts or have been confirmed by the measurement of at least one redshift for galaxies located along a red-sequence typical of cluster early-type galaxies. Lastly, five candidates among those already observed in the infrared have (I-Ks) colors consistent with them being in the redshift interval 0.8<z<1.1.

The R-band isophotal map of this spiral shows that the bulge structure is elongated perpendicularly to the major axis of the disk. At the same time a central stellar velocity gradient is found along the major axis of the bulge. We also present the Sa NGC 4672 as good candidate of a spiral hosting a bulge and a disk orthogonally decoupled with respect to one other. This decoupling of the two fundamental components of a visible galaxy suggests that the disk could represent a second event in the history of early-type spirals.,1999,[],5

The contrast between the two models anticipated and parallels current tensions in the interpretation of interstellar structure, as well as intergalactic Lyman alpha clouds.

astro-ph/9907220,astro-ph,"We present a semi-analytic model for the thermal and ionization history of the universe at 1000 >~ z >~ 3. This model incorporates much of the essential physics included in full-scale hydrodynamical simulations, such as (1) gravitational collapse and virialization; (2) star/quasar formation and subsequent ionizing radiation; (3) heating and cooling; (4) atomic and molecular physics of hydrogen; and (5) the feedback relationships between these processes. In addition, we model the process of reheating and reionization using two separate phases, self-consistently calculating the filling factor of each phase. Thus radiative transfer is treated more accurately than simulations to date have done: we allow to lowest order for both the inhomogeneity of the sources and the sinks of radiation. After calibrating and checking the results of this model against a hydrodynamical simulation, we apply our model to a variety of Gaussian and non-Gaussian CDM-dominated cosmological models. Our major conclusions include: (1) the epoch of reheating depends most strongly on the power spectrum of density fluctuations at small scales; (2) because of the effects of gas clumping, full reionization occurs at z ~ 10 in all models; (3) the CMBR polarization and the stars and quasars to baryons ratio are strong potential discrimants between different assumed power spectra; (4) the formation of galactic spheroids may be regulated by the evolution of reheating through feedback, so that the Jeams mass tracks the non-linear mass scale; and (5) the evolution of the bias of luminous objects can potentially discriminate strongly between Gaussian and non-Gaussian PDFs.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9911181,astro-ph,"In October 1997 daily monitoring observations of the Crab pulsar at 327 MHz and 610 MHz with an 85ft telescope in Green Bank, WV showed a jump in the dispersion by 0.12 cm-3 pc.

In the months before this event faint ghost emission, a replica of the pulse, was detected with a nearly frequency independent delay that quadratically diminished to zero. There was also a curious shift in the phase, a slowdown, at all frequencies at the time of the dispersion jump. I attribute most of these phenomena to the perturbing optics of a plasma prism that is located in the filamentary interface between the synchrotron nebula and the supernova ejecta and which crosses the line of sight over a period of months.

astro-ph/9910021,astro-ph,"We report high-resolution CO(1-0) observations in the central 6 kpc of the LINER galaxy NGC 5005 with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory millimeter array. Molecular gas is distributed in three components - a ring at a radius of about 3 kpc, a strong central condensation, and a stream to the northwest of the nucleus but inside the 3 kpc ring. The central condensation is a disk of about 1 kpc radius with a molecular gas mass of 2 x 109 Msun. The stream between the 3 kpc ring and the nuclear disk lies on a straight dust lane seen in the optical. If this material moves in the plane of the galaxy, it has a velocity offset by up to ~ 150 km/s from galactic rotation. We suggest that an optically inconspicuous stellar bar lying within the 3 kpc ring can explain the observed gas dynamics. This bar is expected to connect the nuclear disk and the ring along the position angle of the northwest stream. A position-velocity cut in this direction reveals features which match the characteristic motions of gas in a barred potential. Our model indicates that gas in the northwest stream is on an x1 orbit at the bar's leading edge; it is falling into the nucleus with a large noncircular velocity, and will eventually contribute about 2 x 108 Msun to the nuclear disk. If most of this material merges with the disk on its first passage of pericenter, the gas accretion rate during the collision will be 50 Msun/yr. We associate the nuclear disk with an inner 2:1 Lindblad resonance, and the 3 kpc ring with an inner 4:1 Lindblad resonance. The high rate of bar-driven inflow and the irregular appearance of the northwest stream suggest that a major fueling event is in progress in NGC 5005. Such episodic (rather than continuous) gas supply can regulate the triggering of starburst and accretion activity in galactic nuclei. (abridged)",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9907423,astro-ph,"We combine morphological classifications from deep HST imaging of a sample of 3 clusters at z=0.31 and a further 9 clusters at z=0.37-0.56 with existing spectroscopic observations of their E and S0 populations, to study the relative spectral properties of these two galaxy types. We have also used similar data for the Coma cluster as a present day bench-mark with which to compare our data at higher redshift. The data span the range where strong evolution is claimed in the proportion of S0 galaxies within rich clusters. Techniques have been recently developed to analyse the strengths of absorption lines in the spectra of local, passive galaxies to separate the effects of age & metallicity and hence date the ages of the most recent, substantial star formation episode in these galaxies. We have applied these techniques to the co-added spectra of the distant cluster galaxies to determine the relative ages of the E and S0 populations. We find no statistically significant difference between the luminosity-weighted ages of the E and S0 galaxies in these clusters. The precision of this measurement would indicate that any recent star formation in the cluster S0s at z=0.31 could have involved bursts of no more than ~11% (by mass) in strength in no more than half of these galaxies. Our results, in conjunction with other work, suggest that the progenitors of S0 galaxies in rich clusters are mostly early-type spirals who, through interactions with the cluster environment, have had their star formation truncated. This indicates a relatively unspectacular origin for the missing S0 population at high redshift.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9910142,astro-ph,"During a Hubble time, cluster galaxies may undergo several mutual encounters close enough to gravitationally perturb their hot, X-ray emitting gas flows. We ran several 2D, time dependent hydrodynamical models to investigate the effects of such perturbations on the gas flow inside elliptical galaxies. In particular, we studied in detail the modifications occurring in the scenario proposed by D'Ercole et al. (1989), in which the galactic interstellar medium produced by the aging galactic stellar population, is heated by SNIa at a decreasing rate. We find that, although the tidal interaction in our models lasts less than 1 Gyr, its effect extends over several Gyrs. The tidally induced turbulent flows create dense filaments which cool quickly and accrete onto the galactic center, producing large spikes in the global Lx. Once this mechanism starts, it is fed by gravity and amplified by SNIa. In cooling flow models without supernovae the amplitude of the Lx fluctuations due to the tidal interaction is substantially reduced. We conclude that, if SNIa significantly contribute to the energetics of the gas flows in ellipticals, then the observed spread in the Lx-Lb diagram may be caused, at least in part, by this mechanism. On the contrary, tidal interactions cannot be responsible for the observed spread if the pure cooling flow scenario applies (abridged).",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9909158,astro-ph,"Radial velocity surveys are examined in terms of eigenmode analysis within the framework of CDM-like family of models. Rich surveys such as MARK III and SFI, which consist of more than equation radial velocities, are found to have a few tens of modes that are not noise dominated. Poor surveys, which have only a few tens of radial velocities, are noise dominated across the eigenmode spectrum. In particular, the bulk velocity of such surveys has been found to be dominated by the more noisy modes. The MARK III and SFI are well fitted by a tilted flat CDM model found by a maximum likelihood analysis and a equation statistics . However, a mode-by-mode inspection shows that a substantial fraction of the modes lie outside the equation confidence level.

astro-ph/9912063,astro-ph,"There has been increasing evidence that at least some GRBs are emission beamed. The beamed GRB afterglow evolution has been discussed by several authors in the ultra-relativistic case.   It has been shown that the dynamics of the blast wave will be significantly modified by the sideways expansion, and there may be a sharp break in the afterglow light curves under certain circumstances. However, this is true only when the fireball is still relativistic. Here we present an analytical approach to the evolution of the beamed GRB blast wave expanding in the surrounding medium (density equation) in the non-relativistic case, our purpose is to explore whether the sideways expansion will strongly affect the blast wave evolution as in the relativistic case. We find that the blast wave evolution is strongly dependent on the speed of the sideways expansion. If it expands with the sound speed, then the jet angle equation increases with time as equation, which means that the sideways expansion has little effect on the afterglow light curves, the flux equation for equation and equation for equation.It is clear that the light curve of equation is not always steeper than that of equation, as in the relativistic case.We also show that if the expansion speed is a constant, then the jet angle equation, and the radius equation, in this case the sideways expansion has the most significant effect on the blast wave evolution, the flux equation independent of equation, and we expect that there should be a smooth and gradual break in the light curve.",1999,[],5

We have detected the 5.6-day orbital period in Lomb-Scargle periodograms of both light curves and hardness ratios when Cyg X-1 was in the hard state. This detection was made with improved sensitivity and temporal coverage compared with previous detections by other X-ray missions. The folded light curves and hardness ratios show a broad intensity dip accompanied by spectral hardening centered on superior conjunction of the X-ray source. The dip has a duration of about 27% of the orbital period and depth ranging from 8% to 23% of the non-dip intensities in three energy bands. Variability on time scales of hours is often evident within the broad dip in the unfolded data. In contrast, no feature at the orbital period is evident in the periodograms or folded light curves for the soft state. Absorption of X-rays by a stellar wind from the companion star can reproduce the observed X-ray orbital modulations in the hard state. To explain the low orbital modulation in the soft-state data, a reduction of the wind density during the soft state would be required.

This event is characterized by unusual properties: its strength increases, and its duration decreases with wavelength, and it peaks earlier at 20cm than at 3.6 and 6cm. We discuss several generic models (a `standard' shock-in-jet model, a precessing beam, free-free-absorption in a foreground screen, interstellar scattering, and gravitational microlensing), and explore whether they can account for our observations. Most attempts at explaining the data on 0235164 require an extremely small source size, which can be reconciled with the equation K inverse Compton limit only when the Doppler factor of the bulk flow is of order 100.

astro-ph/9904370,astro-ph,"The masses of the central black holes in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) can be estimated using the broad emission-lines as a probe of the virial mass.

Compiling a sample of AGNs with reliable central masses and bulge magnitudes we find an average black-hole-to-bulge mass ratio of 0.0003, a factor of 20 less than the value found for normal galaxies and for bright quasars. This lower ratio is more consistent with the back hole mass density predicted from quasar light, and is similar to the central black hole/bulge mass ratio in our Galaxy. We argue that the black hole/bulge mass ratio actually has a significantly larger range than indicated by mssive black holes detected in normal galaxies (using stellar dynamics) and in bright quasars, which may be biased towards large black holes.

astro-ph/9910323,astro-ph,"(Abridged) We report multi-epoch VLBI observations of the source PKS 1741-038 as it underwent an extreme scattering event. Observations at four epochs were obtained, and images were produced at three of these. During the event the source consisted of a dominant, compact component, essentially identical to the structure seen outside the event. However, the source's diameter increased slightly at 13 cm during the ESE. An increase in the source's diameter is inconsistent with a simple refractive model. We also see no evidence for ESE-induced substructure within the source or the formation of multiple images, as would occur in a strongly refractive lens. However, a model in which the decrease in flux density during the ESE occurs solely because of stochastic broadening within the lens requires a larger broadening diameter during the ESE than is observed. Thus, the ESE toward 1741-038 involved both stochastic broadening and refractive defocussing within the lens. If the structure responsible for the ESE has a size of order 1 AU, the level of scattering within an ESE lens may be a factor of 107 larger than that in the ambient medium. A filamentary structure could reduce the difference between the strength of scattering in the lens and ambient medium, but we conclude that, if ESEs arise from filamentary structures, they occur when the filamentary structures are seen lengthwise. We predict the amount of pulse broadening that would result from a comparable lens passing in front of a pulsar. The pulse broadening would be no more than 1.1 microseconds, consistent with the lack of pulse broadening detected during ESEs toward the pulsars PSR B193721 and PSR J1643-1224.",1999,[],5

A further 6% show only [NII] with H-alpha in absorption. We find no evidence for an increase in the frequency of line emission with X-ray luminosity. Purely X-ray selected clusters at low redshift have a higher probability of containing line emission. The more H-alpha luminous galaxies have larger emission-line regions and show a higher ratio of Balmer to forbidden line emission, although there is a continuous trend of ionization behaviour across four decades in H-alpha luminosity. Galaxies with the more luminous line emission show a significantly bluer continuum, whereas lower-luminosity and [NII]-only line emitters have continua that differ little from those of non-line emitting dominant galaxies. Values of the Balmer decrement in the more luminous systems commonly imply intrinsic reddening of E(B-V)~0.3, and when this is corrected for, the excess blue light can be characterized by a population of massive young stars, which can also provide sufficient photoionization to produce the observed H-alpha luminosity. The lower H-alpha luminosity systems show a higher ionization state and few massive stars, requiring instead the introduction of a harder source of photoionization.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9908191,astro-ph,"We present results of correlation studies, examining the association between the peak of the nu Fnu spectrum of gamma ray bursts, Ep, with the burst's energy fluence and photon peak flux. We discuss methods to account for data truncation in Ep and fluence or flux when performing the correlation analyses.   However, because bursts near the detector threshold are not usually able to provide reliable spectral parameters, we focus on results for the brightest bursts in which we can better understand the selection effects relevant to Ep and burst strength.   We find that there is a strong correlation between total fluence and Ep. We discuss these results in terms of both cosmological and intrinsic effects.   In particular, we show that for realistic distributions of the burst parameters, cosmological expansion alone cannot account for the correlation between Ep and total fluence; the observed correlation is likely a result of an intrinsic relation between the burst rest-frame peak energy and the total radiated energy. We investigate this latter scenario in the context of synchrotron radiation from external and internal shock models of GRBs. We find that the internal shock model is consistent with our interpretation of the correlation, while the external shock model cannot easily explain this intrinsic relation between peak energy and burst radiated energy.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9912086,astro-ph,"We present the results of a study aimed at determining the 12C/13C ratio in two samples of planetary nebulae (PNe) by means of millimeter wave observations of 12CO and 13CO. The first group includes six PNe which have been observed in the 3He hyperfine transition by Balser et al. (1997); the other group consists of 22 nebulae with rich molecular envelopes. We have determined the carbon isotopic ratio in 14 objects, 9 of which are new detections. The results indicate a range of values of 12C/13C between 9 and 23. We estimate the mass of the progenitors of the PNe of our sample and combine this information with the derived 12C/13C isotopic ratios to test the predictions of stellar nucleosynthesis models.   We find that the majority of PNe have isotopic ratios below the values expected from current standard asymptotic giant branch models in the mass range of interest. We suggest that the progenitors of the PNe must have undergone a non-standard mixing process during their red giant phase and/or asymptotic giant phase, resulting in a significant enhancement of the 13C abundance in the surface layers. Our study confirms a similar behaviour inferred from spectroscopic observations of field population II stars and globular cluster giants, and extends it to the final stages of stellar evolution. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results on models of Galactic chemical evolution of 3He and 12C/13C.",1999,[],5

We obtained a new spectrum of AXJ0341.4-4453 extending to 9600 Angstroms which reveals broad Balmer lines and other characteristics of Seyfert 1 galaxies. The FWHM of broad H-beta is at least 1600 km/s, while [O III]5007 has FWHM = 730 km/s. The flux ratio [O III]5007/H-beta = 1. Thus, AXJ0341.4-4453 is by definition a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy, or perhaps a moderately reddened Seyfert 1 galaxy, but it is not a Type 2 QSO. Although examples of the latter have long been sought, particularly in connection with the problem of the X-ray background, there is still virtually no evidence for the existence of any Type 2 QSO among X-ray selected samples.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9904333,astro-ph,"Disk accretion onto a slowly rotating neutron star with a weak magnetic field equation gauss is considered in a wide range of luminosities equation where equation is the Eddington luminosity. We construct a theory for the deceleration of rotation and the spread of matter over the stellar surface in the shallow-water approximation. The rotation slows down due to friction against the dense underlying layers. The deceleration of Keplerian rotation and the energy release take place on the stellar surface in a latitudinal belt whose meridional width rises with increasing equation The combined effect of centrifugal force and radiation pressure gives rise to two latitudinal rings of enhanced brightness which are symmetric around the equator in the upper and lower hemispheres. They lie near the edges of differentially rotating and radiating upper and lower belts. The bright rings shift from the equatorial zone to higher latitudes when the luminosity equation rises. The ring zones are characterized by a minimum surface density and, accordingly, by a maximum meridional spread velocity. At a low accretion rate and luminosity, the released energy is removed through the comptonization of low-frequency photons.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9902186,astro-ph,"We present model light curves for accreting Black Hole Candidates (BHC) based on a recently proposed model for their spectro-temporal properties. According to this model, the observed light curves and aperiodic variability of BHC are due to a series of soft photon injections at random (Poisson) intervals near the compact object and their reprocessing into hard radiation in an extended but non-uniform hot plasma corona surrounding the compact object. We argue that the majority of the timing characteristics of these light curves are due to the stochastic nature of the Comptonization process in the extended corona, whose properties, most notably its radial density dependence, are imprinted in them. We compute the corresponding Power Spectral Densities (PSD), autocorrelation functions, time skewness of the light curves and time lags between the light curves of the sources at different photon energies and compare our results to observation. Our model light curves compare well with observations, providing good fits to their overall morphology, as manifest by the autocorrelation and skewness functions. The lags and PSDs of the model light curves are also in good agreement with those observed (the model can even accommodate the presence of QPOs). Finally, while most of the variability power resides at time scales equation a few seconds, at the same time, the model allows also for shots of a few msec in duration, in accordance with observation. We suggest that refinements of this type of model along with spectral and phase lag information can be used to probe the structure of this class of high energy sources.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9906051,astro-ph,"When measuring diameters of partially resolved sources like planetary nebulae, H II regions or galaxies, often a technique called gaussian deconvolution is used. This technique yields a gaussian diameter which subsequently has to be multiplied with a conversion factor to obtain the true angular diameter of the source. This conversion factor is a function of the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the beam. It also depends on the intrinsic surface brightness distribution of the source.   In this paper the theory behind this technique will be studied. This study will be restricted to circularly symmetric geometries and beams. First an implicit equation will be derived, from which the conversion factor for a given surface brightness distribution and beam size can be solved. Explicit expressions for the conversion factor will be derived from this equation which are valid in cases where the beam size is larger than the intrinsic size of the source. A more detailed discussion will be given for two simple geometries: a circular constant surface brightness disk and a spherical constant emissivity shell with arbitrary inner radius. The theory is subsequently used to construct a new technique for determining the FWHM of an arbitrary observed surface brightness distribution.   Usually the FWHM of the source and beam are measured using gaussian fits, but second moments can also be used. The alternative use of second moments in this context is studied here for the first time and it is found that in this case the conversion factor has a different value which is independent of the beam size. In the limit for infinitely large beam sizes, the values of the conversion factors for both techniques are equal.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9906374,astro-ph,"We present X-ray observations of two young energetic radio pulsars, PSRs B1046-58 and B1610-50, and their surroundings, using archival data from the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA).   The energetic pulsar PSR B1046-58 is detected in X-rays with a significance of 4.5 sigma. The unabsorbed flux, estimated assuming a power-law spectrum and a neutral hydrogen column density NH of 5E21 cm-2 is (2.5 /- 0.3) x 10E-13 ergs/cm2/s in the 2-10 keV band. Pulsed emission is not detected; the pulsed fraction is less than 31% at the 90% confidence level for a 50% duty cycle. We argue that the emission is best explained as originating from a pulsar-powered synchrotron nebula. The X-ray counterpart of the pulsar is the only hard source within the 95% error region of the previously unidentified gamma-ray source 3EG J1048-5840. This evidence supports the results of Kaspi et al. (1999), who in a companion paper, suggest that PSR B1046-58 is the counterpart to 3EG J1048-5840.   X-ray emission from PSR B1610-50 is not detected. Using similar assumptions as above, the derived 3 sigma upper limit for the unabsorbed 2-10 keV X-ray flux is 1.5E-13 ergs/cm2/s. We use the flux limit to estimate the pulsar's velocity to be less than ~170 km/s, casting doubt on a previously reported association between PSR B1610-50 and supernova remnant Kes 32. Kes 32 is detected, as is evident from the correlation between X-ray and radio emission. The ASCA images of PSR B1610-50 are dominated by mirror-scattered emission from the X-ray-bright supernova remnant RCW 103, located 33' away.

astro-ph/9908355,astro-ph,"How elliptical galaxy dynamics relate to galaxy structure, stellar populations, spiral galaxies and environment are reviewed. The evidence assembled shows that most, if not all, galaxies originally classified as gE contain disks within them. Taken together, the existing evidence are most consistent with the gravitational, hierarchical, clustering, merging (HCM) concept that all galaxies, including gE, are formed from the combination of much smaller galaxies. Within the HCM picture, the evidence also strongly suggests that the subunits which go into forming galaxies must be related in specific ways both to the mass of the galaxy they will form, and to the environment in which the galaxy forms. Despite the extensive data that we now have on galaxies that can constrain their formation history, the lack of a physical understanding of the stellar initial mass function prevents us from developing realistic physical models for galaxy formation.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9906332,astro-ph,"(abridged) We present STARDUST, a new self-consistent modelling of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies from far-UV to radio wavelengths. In order to derive the SEDs in this broad spectral range, we first couple spectrophotometric and (closed-box) chemical evolutions to account for metallicity effects on the spectra of synthetic stellar populations. We then use a phenomenological fit for the metal-dependent extinction curve and a simple geometric distribution of the dust to compute the optical depth of galaxies and the corresponding obscuration curve. This enables us to calculate the fraction of stellar light reprocessed in the infrared range. In a final step, we define a dust model with various components and we fix the weights of these components in order to reproduce the IRAS correlation of IR colours with total IR luminosities. This allows us to compute far-IR SEDs that phenomenologically mimic observed trends. We are able to predict the spectral evolution of galaxies in a broad wavelength range, and we can reproduce the observed SEDs of local spirals, starbursts, luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) and ultra luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). This modelling is so far kept as simple as possible and depends on a small number of free parameters, namely the initial mass function (IMF), star formation rate (SFR) time scale, gas density, and galaxy age, as well as on more refined assumptions on dust properties and the presence (or absence) of gas inflows/outflows.",1999,[],5

A companion paper extends these calculations into the M giant regime. Colors are tabulated for Johnson U-V and B-V; Cousins V-R and V-I; Johnson-Glass V-K, J-K and H-K; and CIT/CTIO V-K, J-K, H-K and CO. We have developed these color-temperature (CT) relations by convolving synthetic spectra with photometric filter-transmission-profiles. The synthetic spectra have been computed with the SSG spectral synthesis code using MARCS stellar atmosphere models as input. Both of these codes have been improved substantially, especially at low temperatures, through the incorporation of new opacity data. The resulting synthetic colors have been put onto the observational systems by applying color calibrations derived from models and photometry of field stars which have Teffs determined by the infrared-flux method. The color calibrations have zero points and slopes which change most of the original synthetic colors by less than 0.02 mag and 5%, respectively. The adopted Teff scale (Bell & Gustafsson 1989) is confirmed by the extraordinary agreement between the predicted and observed angular diameters of the field stars. We have also derived empirical CT relations from the field-star photometry. Except for the coolest dwarfs (Teff < 5000 K), our calibrated, solar-metallicity model colors are found to match these and other empirical relations quite well. Our calibrated, 4 Gyr, solar-metallicity isochrone also provides a good match to color-magnitude diagrams of M67. We regard this as evidence that our calibrated colors can be applied to many astrophysical problems, including modelling the integrated light of galaxies. (abridged)",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9903002,astro-ph,"We compute statistical properties of weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure in three Cold Dark Matter models. We use a PequationM equation-body code to simulate the formation and evolution of large-scale structure in the universe. We perform equation ray-tracing experiments for each model using the multiple lens-plane algorithm. From the results of these experiments, we calculate the probability distribution functions (PDF) of the convergences, shears, and magnifications, and their root-mean-square (rms) values. We find that the rms values of the convergence and shear agree with the predictions of a nonlinear analytical model. We also find that the PDFs of the magnifications equation have a peak at values slightly smaller than equation, and are strongly skewed toward large magnifications. In particular, for the high-density model, a power-law tail appears in the magnification distribution at large magnifications for sources at redshifts equation. The rms values of the magnifications essentially agree with the nonlinear analytical predictions for sources at low redshift, but exceed these predictions for high redshift sources, once the power-law tail appears.   We study the effect of magnification bias on the luminosity functions of high-redshift quasars, using the calculated PDFs of the magnifications. We show that the magnification bias is moderate in the absence of the power-law tail in the magnification distribution, but depends strongly on the value of the density parameter. In presence of the power-law tail, the bias becomes considerable, especially at the bright end of the luminosity functions.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9908098,astro-ph,"Monte Carlo simulations show that the pulse profile of Cherenkov photons measured near the core of an extensive air shower is sensitive to the secondary muon/electron ratio of the cascade. Cherenkov pulses can easily be measured with a single large area mirror viewed by a photomultiplier tube subtending a small field of view (~1 degree). Even for such a simple experiment, exposed to EAS from a range of core locations and arrival directions, strong statistical differences are shown to exist between the pulse parameter distributions of primary protons and those of heavier primary particles. A range of primary energies can be investigated by varying the zenith angle of observations. In this paper, results from simulations of primaries in the energy range 20TeV to 400TeV are presented, although in principle the technique could be extended to include the knee of the spectrum. At the lower end of this energy range results can be compared to direct measurements of the composition, while measurements at the upper end can augment results from existing ground based experiments.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9911245,astro-ph,"Microlensing in Q22370305 between 1985 and 1995 (eg. Irwin et al. 1989; Corrigan et al. 1991; Ostensen et al. 1996) has been interpreted in two different ways; as microlensing by stellar mass objects of a continuum source having dimensions significantly smaller than the microlens Einstein radius (ER) (eg. Wambsganss, Paczynski & Schneider 1990; Rauch & Blandford 1991), and as microlensing by very low mass objects of a source as large as 5 ER (Refsdal & Stabell 1993; Haugan 1996). In this paper we present evidence in favour of a small source. Limits on the source size (in units of ER) are obtained from the combination of limits on the number of microlens Einstein radii crossed by the source during the monitoring period with two separate light-curve features. Firstly, recently published monitoring data (Wozniak et al. 2000; OGLE web page) show large variations (~0.8-1.5 magnitudes) between image brightnesses over a period of 700 days or ~15% of the monitoring period. Secondly, the 1988 peak in the image A light-curve had a duration that is a small fraction (<0.02) of the monitoring period. Such rapid microlensing rises and short microlensing peaks only occur for small sources. We find that the observed large-rapid variation limits the source size to be <0.2 ER (95% confidence). The width of the light-curve peak provides a stronger constraint of <0.02 ER (99% confidence). The Einstein radius (projected into the source plane) of the average microlens mass (m) in Q22370305 is ER ~ 1017\sqrtm cm.

All sources have been detected up to \~ 100 keV and their spectral characteristics derived with good accuracy. Although the results obtained from the detailed analysis of individual sources indicate some 'source-by-source' differences, we show in the following that all spectra are consistent, at least qualitatively, with what expected from a '0th-order' version of unified models. Indeed, a simple test on these data indicates that these Seyfert 2 galaxies are on average intrinsically very similar to Seyfert 1 galaxies (i.e., steep at E>10 keV) and that the main difference can be ascribed to a different amount of absorbing matter along the line of sight (i.e. different inclinations of our line of sight with respect to a putative molecular torus or different thicknesses of the tori).",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9912079,astro-ph,"The rotational transitions of carbon monoxide (CO) are the primary means of investigating the density and velocity structure of the molecular interstellar medium. Here we study the lowest four rotational transitions of CO towards high-latitude translucent molecular clouds (HLCs). We report new observations of the J = (4-3), (2-1), and (1-0) transitions of CO towards eight high-latitude clouds. The new observations are combined with data from the literature to show that the emission from all observed CO transitions is linearly correlated. This implies that the excitation conditions which lead to emission in these transitions are uniform throughout the clouds. Observed 13CO/12CO (1-0) integrated intensity ratios are generally much greater than the expected abundance ratio of the two species, indicating that the regions which emit 12CO (1-0) radiation are optically thick. We develop a statistical method to compare the observed line ratios with models of CO excitation and radiative transfer. This enables us to determine the most likely portion of the physical parameter space which is compatible with the observations. The model enables us to rule out CO gas temperatures greater than 30K since the most likely high-temperature configurations are 1 pc-sized structures aligned along the line of sight. The most probable solution is a high density and low temperature (HDLT) solution. The CO cell size is approximately 0.01 pc (2000 AU).

The availability of panoramic near-infrared detectors on large telescopes provides the opportunity to undertake surveys capable of establishing the importance of extinction by dust on the observed population of quasars. We introduce an efficient method for selecting K-band, flux-limited samples of quasars, termed 'KX' by analogy with the UVX method. This method exploits the difference between the power-law nature of quasar spectra and the convex spectra of stars: quasars are relatively brighter than stars at both short wavelengths (the UVX method) and long wavelengths (the KX method).

astro-ph/9908267,astro-ph,"Recent images of the disks of dust around the young stars HR 4796A and Fomalhaut show, in each case, a double-lobed feature that may be asymmetric (one lobe may be brighter than the other). A symmetric double-lobed structure is that expected from a disk of dust with a central hole that is observed nearly edge-on (i.e., close to the plane of the disk). This paper shows how the gravitational influence of a second body in the system with an eccentric orbit would cause a brightness asymmetry in such a disk by imposing a ""forced eccentricity"" on the orbits of the constituent dust particles, thus shifting the center of symmetry of the disk away from the star and causing the dust near the forced pericenter of the perturbed disk to glow. Dynamic modeling of the HR 4796 disk shows that its 5% brightness asymmetry could be the result of a forced eccentricity as small as 0.02 imposed on the disk by either the binary companion HR 4796B, or by an unseen planet close to the inner edge of the disk. Since it is likely that a forced eccentricity of 0.01 or higher would be imposed on a disk in a system in which there are planets, but no binary companion, the corresponding asymmetry in the disk's structure could serve as a sensitive indicator of these planets that might otherwise remain undetected.",1999,[],5

When galaxies are separated by colors - red galaxies with colors in the rest frame (U-V)o > 1.4, and blue galaxies with (U-V)o =< 1.4 - the strongest orbital segregation is found. Therefore, the segregation we found seems to modify more efficiently the star formation activity than the internal shape of the galaxies. When we compare the orbits of early-type galaxies at intermediate-redshift with those for z=0, they seem to develop significant changes getting much more eccentric. A different behavior is observed in the late-type galaxies, which present no-significant evolution in their orbit shapes.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9908169,astro-ph,"The use of supernovae of Type Ia for the determination of accurate distances rests upon the empirical Phillips relation, in which the brightest events are the broadest in time. Implications of new data upon the homogeneity of light curves under the operation of a stretch in time, of the parabolic luminosity increase at the earliest times, and of the time from explosion to maximum light are discussed. The early luminosity is in excellent agreement with predictions (Arnett 1982), and the lack of prominent higher modes of diffusion constrain progenitor and explosion models. Difficulties with reproducing the observed rise time are restricted to radiative transfer models (e.g., Hoeflich and Khokhlov), and probably due to an overestimate of thermal photon escape due to inadequate line lists. Because of the strong dependence of luminosity on 56Ni mass, some simple models can give a Phillips relation of the correct sense.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9904230,astro-ph,"The theory of gravitational structure formation in astrophysics and cosmology is revised based on real fluid behavior and turbulent mixing theory. Gibson's 1996-1998 theory balances fluid mechanical forces with gravitational forces and density diffusivity with gravitational diffusivity at critical viscous, turbulent, magnetic, and diffusion length scales termed Schwarz scales LSX. Condensation and void formation occurs on non-acoustic density nuclei produced by turbulent mixing for scales L>=LSXmax rather than on sound wave crests and troughs for L>=LJ as required by Jeans's 1902 linear acoustic theory. Schwarz scales LSX = LSV, LST, LSM, or LSD may be smaller or larger than Jeans's scale LJ. Thus, a very different ""nonlinear"" cosmology emerges to replace the currently accepted ""linear"" cosmology. According to the new theory, most of the inner halo dark matter of galaxies consists of planetary mass objects that formed soon after the plasma to neutral gas transition 300,000 years after the Big Bang. These objects are termed primordial fog particles (PFPs) and provide an explanation for Schild's 1996 ""rogue planets ... likely to be the missing mass"" of his observed quasar-lens galaxy, inferred from the twinkling frequencies of both quasar images and their phased difference.",1999,[],5

According to theoretical models, it can make up a significant fraction of the mass of the Universe. One possible form of galactic dark matter, Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), could be detected by their annihilation into monoenergetic gamma-ray line(s). This paper will demonstrate that the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST), scheduled for launch in 2005 by NASA, will be capable of searching for these gamma-ray lines in the energy range from 20 GeV to ~500 GeV and will be sufficiently sensitive to test a number of models.

astro-ph/9902250,astro-ph,"Mean ages and metal abundances are estimated for the stellar populations in a sample of 115 E and S0 galaxies in the central 64'x70' of the Coma cluster. The estimates are based on the line indices Mg2, <Fe> and Hbeta, and the mass-to-light ratios (M/L). Stellar population models from Vazdekis et al. were used to transform from the measured parameters to mean ages, [Mg/H] and [Fe/H]. Comparison of the ages derived from the Mg2-Hbeta diagram to those derived from the Mg2-M/L diagram gives an estimate of the variation in the fraction of dark matter. The distributions of the derived mean ages and abundances show that there are real variations in both the mean ages and in the abundances. We find an intrinsic rms scatter of [Mg/H], [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] of 0.2 dex, and an intrinsic rms scatter of the derived ages of 0.17 dex.   The slopes of the scaling relations between the global parameters for the galaxies (the Mg2-sigma relation, the <Fe>-sigma relation, the Hbeta-sigma relation) are consistent with the relation we find between the ages, the abundances and the velocity dispersions. The slope of the Fundamental Plane is steeper than predicted from the variations in the ages and abundances. Because of the correlation between the mean ages and the mean abundances, substantial variations in the ages and the abundances are possible while maintaining a low scatter of all the scaling relations.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9901232,astro-ph,We suggest that the low viscosity in close binary accretion disks during quiescence is due to magnetic fields from the companion star. In very late evolutionary phase the companion stars become brown dwarfs and have cooled down to such low a temperature that this process cannot work anymore. The extremely low viscosity in WZ Sge stars supports this connection between companion stars and viscosity. We further suggest that magnetic activity in such very cool stars is cut off by their poor electric conductivity.,1999,[],5
astro-ph/9909450,astro-ph,"We investigate the X-ray properties of the powerful radio galaxy Hercules A (3C 348) using ROSAT HRI, PSPC and ASCA observations. The ASCA data are well fit by a thermal plasma model with a temperature of about 4.3 keV and abundances 0.4 solar. The HRI observation clearly reveals extended and elongated X-ray emission. For radii greater than 10 arcsec, the surface brightness profile perpendicular to the elongation is well fit by an isothermal beta--model with beta = 0.63 and a core radius of about 120 kpc. We derive a total mass of the putative cluster of 8.4e13 Msun and a gas mass fraction of about 18 per cent. The inner part of the surface brightness profile clealry reveals the presence of a point source, which contributes about 8 per cent to the total flux. The 0.1-2.4 keV luminosity of the point-like and the extended emission is 3.4e43 and 4.3e44 erg/s, respectively. After subtracting the cluster X-ray emission from the HRI image, residual structures are visible, which partly coincide with the radio jet and lobes.

astro-ph/9906027,astro-ph,"We study the distances and gravitational lensing in spherically symmetric inhomogeneous cosmological models consisting of inner and outer homogeneous regions which are connected by a single shell or double shells at the redshift equation. The density and Hubble parameters in the inner region are assumed to be smaller and larger, respectively, than those in the outer region. It is found that at the stage equation the distances from an observer in the inner void-like region are larger than the counterparts (with equal equation) in the corresponding homogeneous Friedmann models, and hence the magnitudes for the sources at this stage are larger. This effect of the void-like low-density region may explain the deviations of the observed [magnitude-redshift] relation of SNIa from the relation in homogeneous models, independently of the cosmological constant. When the position of the observer deviates from the center, moreover, it is shown that the distances are anisotropic and the images of remote sources are systematically deformed. The above relation at equation and this anisotropy will observationally distinguish the role of the above void-like region from that of the positive cosmological constant. The influence on the time-delay measurement is also discussed.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9911315,astro-ph,"We have analysed the optical luminosity-redshift distribution properties of bright QSOs, using a new large sample from the Hamburg/ESO survey. The sample provides insight into the hitherto poorly sampled bright tail of the luminosity function, allowing to monitor its evolution with redshift up to equation. The slope increases significantly towards higher equation, inconsistent with the predictions of pure luminosity evolution, but also with other recently proposed parameterisations. This phenomenon is opposite to what would be expected from gravitational lensing, showing that magnification bias does not significantly distort the QSO luminosity function within the redshift range covered. The space density of high-luminosity QSOs continues to increase up to the high-redshift limit of the survey, without indication of reduced evolution above equation. The sample also permits an improved estimate of the local (equation) luminosity function of QSOs and bright Seyfert~1 nuclei, over the luminosity range equation.

We present newly acquired optical spectrophotometric data for three Galactic planetary nebulae IC 418, NGC 2392, and NGC 3242 and combine them with UV data from the IUE Final Archive for identical positions in each nebula to determine accurate abundances of He, C, N, O, and Ne at one or more locations in each object. We then collect abundances of these elements for the entire sample and compare them with theoretical predictions of planetary nebula abundances from a grid of intermediate mass star models. We find some consistency between observations and theory, lending modest support to our current understanding of nucleosynthesis in stars below 8 Mo in birth mass. Overall, we believe that observed abundances agree with theoretical predictions to well within an order of magnitude but probably not better than within a factor of 2 or 3. But even this level of consistency between observation and theory enhances the validity of published intermediate-mass stellar yields of carbon and nitrogen in the study of the abundance evolution of these elements.",1999,[],5

We present a brief outline of the principal contributions and then give a general overview of two new areas of x-ray astronomy that have proven by RXTE to be very fruitful: accreting neutron stars with millisecond spin periods and microquasars.

astro-ph/9909483,astro-ph,"We present results of broad band BVRI observations of a sample of galaxies with a low surface brightness (LSB) disk and a bulge. These galaxies are well described as exponential disks and exponential bulges with no preferred value for either scale length or central surface brightness. The median B band disk scale length is 12.6 kpc (H(0) = 75 km s-1 Mpc-1) which is much larger than scale lengths of typical (disk dominated) LSB or high surface brightness (HSB) galaxies. Furthermore, the disk and bulge scale lengths are correlated, suggesting a coupling in the formation. Bulge dominated LSB galaxies are observed to be redder than disk dominated LSB galaxies and their bulge-to-disk ratios are increasing towards redder wavelengths. We find colors that are comparable to or bluer than HSB galaxies of the same morphological types. Bulge dominated LSB galaxies are therefore not faded HSB galaxies with no current star formation. We find that bulge dominated LSB galaxies fit in with the general trends defined by the HSB galaxies. The properties of these bulge dominated LSB galaxies show that LSB galaxies do not just come in two varieties. They cover the entire range in optical and morphological properties between late-type disk dominated LSBs and giant Malin-1-like LSBs. LSB galaxies thus also form a LSB Hubble sequence, parallel to the classical HSB one.",1999,[],5

The S-Z effect produces a generically non-Gaussian field and we compute the variance in the simulated temperature-anisotropy images, after convolution with the ATCA beam pattern, for different cosmological models. All the models are normalised to the 4-year \it COBE data. We find an increase in the simulated-sky temperature variance with increase in the cosmological density parameter equation.

astro-ph/9906324,astro-ph,"We consider supercritical accretion onto a compact object when the accretion rate exceeds its value derived from the Eddington limit: LEdd/c2. We use the scenario that was proposed by Shakura and Sunyaev (1973) for the supercritical regime, according to which matter flows out of the gas-disk surface under radiation pressure. An analytic solution of the accretion-disk structure is obtained for this scenario by using classical equations. An attempt is made to construct a model for nonconservative supercritical accretion with advection. To this end, we develop a numerical scheme for calculating the structure of an advective disk with mass outflow. The goal of solving the problem of a supercritical disk with mass loss is to explain accreting sources with outflowing envelopes, for example, SS 433 and galactic nuclei. The structure and observational manifestations of the envelope which forms around a supercritical disk are considered by taking into account bremsstrahlung absorption and Thomson scattering of photons.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9905092,astro-ph,"The observation that the extremely broad, blueshifted absorption troughs which characterize broad absorption line quasars (BALQs) occur exclusively in radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) suggests that this class of active galactic nuclei (AGN) may offer important clues to the radio-loud/radio-quiet (RL/RQ) dichotomy in quasars. Interestingly, there is also substantial observational evidence for similar, but lower velocity intrinsic absorption outflows in some Seyferts and radio-loud quasars (RLQs) as well. Theoretically, however, it is difficult to interpret this broad range of mass ejection phenomena in the context of the standard model for BALQs. Thus, a new model is considered here in which the thermal gas producing the blueshifted absorption troughs is associated with a poorly collimated outflow of weakly radio-emitting plasma -- in essence, a weak jet. This model provides an appropriate framework not only for assessing the possible connection between the BAL phenomenon in RQQs and related intrinsic absorption outflows in stronger radio sources and in less luminous sources, both of which are known to possess jet-like radio structure, but also for understanding the RL/RQ dichotomy in light of recent observations which indicate that at least some RQQs possess central engines that are capable of producing weak versions of the powerful radio jets characteristic of RLQs.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9910397,astro-ph,"We study contributions to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) bispectrum from non-Gaussianity induced by secondary anisotropies during reionization. Large-scale structure in the reionized epoch both gravitational lenses CMB photons and produces Doppler shifts in their temperature from scattering off electrons in infall. The resulting correlation is potentially observable through the CMB bispectrum. The second-order Ostriker-Vishniac also couples to a variety of linear secondary effects to produce a bispectrum. For the currently favored flat cosmological model with a low matter content and small optical depth in the reionized epoch equation, however, these bispectrum contributions are well below the detection threshold of MAP and at or below that of Planck, given their cosmic and noise variance limitations. At the upper end of this range, they can serve as an extra source of noise for measurements with Planck of either primordial nongaussianity or that induced by the correlation of gravitational lensing with the integrated Sachs-Wolfe and the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects. We include a discussion of the general properties of the CMB bispectrum, its configuration dependence for the various effects, and its computation in the Limber approximation and beyond.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9901242,astro-ph,"Given the recently deduced relationship between X-ray temperatures and stellar velocity dispersions (the ""T-sigma relation"") in an optically complete sample of elliptical galaxies (Davis & White 1996), we demonstrate that L>L* ellipticals contain substantial amounts of dark matter in general. We present constraints on the dark matter scale length and on the dark-to-luminous mass ratio within the optical half-light radius and within the entire galaxy. For example, we find that minimum values of dark matter core radii scale as rdm > 4(LV/3L*)3/4h-180 kpc and that the minimum dark matter mass fraction is >~20% within one optical effective radius re and is >~39-85% within 6re, depending on the stellar density profile and observed value of betaspec. We also confirm the prediction of Davis & White (1996) that the dark matter is characterized by velocity dispersions that are greater than those of the luminous stars: sigmadm2 ~ 1.4-2 sigma*2. The T-sigma relation implies a nearly constant mass-to-light ratio within six half-light radii: M/LV ~ 25h80 Msun/LVsun. This conflicts with the simplest extension of CDM theories of large scale structure formation to galactic scales; we consider a couple of modifications which can better account for the observed T-sigma relation.",1999,[],5

The NE region is ~13 arcmin from the galaxy centre, while the W region lies 10 arcmin out, and within the wispy low surface brightness outer regions of the galaxy. The fields are not crowded and contain few NGC 6822 stars. We discuss errors and uncertainties and find that the W region contains a main sequence that extends to stars of about 2 solar masses, with an age of about 200 Myr. The NE region has no main sequence or stars younger than 1 Gyr, but does contain some luminous red stars that are not matched in the W field. These stars are not clumped in the field.

The corresponding optical depth, averaged over four directions, is 0.38 (0.53, -0.15) 10-6. All three candidates have long Einstein radius crossing times (equation 70 to 100 days). For one of them, the lack of evidence for a parallax or a source size effect enabled us to constrain the lens-source % geometric configuration. Another candidate displays a modulation of the magnification, which is compatible with the lensing of a binary source.

astro-ph/9906064,astro-ph,"Although stellar SED models are constantly improving and seem to show similar differential tendencies as measured spectra, their absolute properties (eg. absolute flux in different wavelength regions) can still differ significantly from the measured ones. Therefore, it is necessary to ""color-calibrate"" the theoretical spectra to obtain realistic model-based stellar spectra, which can then be used for many purposes, such as population synthesis models. In order to calibrate a hybrid library (consisting of the Kurucz -, the Allard and Hauschild -, and the Scholz-models) of theoretical SEDs, UBVRIJHKLM photometric data of solar neighborhood stars were collected from the literature, and the solar metallicity models were calibrated using an algorithm developed by Cuisinier et. al. The corrections were then propagated through the whole grid of models, resulting in the ""semi-empirical"" models (available on ftp from the university of Basel). In order to extend the calibration to non-solar abundances, we have collected UBVRIJHKL photometric data from well-known Galactic globular clusters, covering a wide range of metallicities.

This sample comprises 19 High-energy cutoff BL Lacs objects (HBLs), 1 Low-energy cutoff BL Lac object (LBL) and 2 `intermediate' sources. Data for LBLs, which are mostly radio selected BL Lac objects (RBLs) are taken from the literature. It is shown that the radio--millimetre spectral indices (equation) of HBLs (equation) are slightly steeper than those of the LBLs (equation). A correlation exists between equation and 230 GHz luminosity. While this correlation could be an artefact of comparing two populations of BL Lac objects with intrinsically different radio properties it is also consistent with the predictions of existing unified schemes which relate BL Lac objects to Fanaroff- Riley class I radio galaxies. The HBLs have significantly flatter submillimetre- X-ray spectral indices (equation) than the LBLs (equation cf. equation)although the two intermediate sources also have intermediate values of equation. It is argued that this difference cannot be explained entirely by the viewing angle hypothesis and requires a difference in physical source parameters. The equation values for the HBLs are close to the canonical value found for large samples of radio sources and thus suggest that synchrotron radiation is the mechanism that produces the X-ray emission. As suggested by Padovani & Giommi, the inverse-Compton mechanism is likely to dominate in the LBLs requiring the synchrotron spectra of these sources to steepen or cutoff at lower frequencies than those of the HBLs.",1999,[],5

We suggest on the basis of some simple models that as much as half of this galaxy might have accreted from low-mass satellites, but no single one of the three classic modes of galaxy formation (accretion, disk mergers, in situ formation) can supply a fully satisfactory formation picture. Even when they are used in combination, strong challenges to these models remain. The principal anomaly in this GCS is essentially the complete lack of metal-rich clusters. If these were present in normal (M87-like) numbers in addition to the metal-poor ones that are already there, then the GCS in total would more closely resemble what we see in many other giant E galaxies.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9907272,astro-ph,"We present the results of our search for variable stars in the intermediate-age open cluster NGC 7789. We have found 45 variable stars: 35 eclipsing binaries, five pulsating variables and five miscellaneous variables. Most of the eclipsing binaries show W UMa type of variability, with periods shorter than one day. Four systems exhibit unusual behavior: two, V4276 and V6698, are probably RS CVn stars, another, V3283, is a possible cataclysmic binary. The nature of the fourth binary, V2130, is unclear: the system exhibits assymetric maxima. Among the pulsating variables two, V3407C and V4805 are background RR Lyrae stars and one, V6736, is a delta Scuti variable which is a blue straggler belonging to the cluster. Some of the miscellaneous variables may have periods longer than the five day timespan of our observations. We also present a color-magnitude diagram for the NGC 7789 open cluster, fairly complete down to V ~ 20. The relatively large number of variables found in the comparison field (14 compared to 31 in the cluster field) implies that objects not associated physically with the cluster can account for a significant number of variables identified in the cluster field, as well as in other globular and open clusters observed on a dense background/foreground of disk stars.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9907345,astro-ph,"SN1994D of type Ia has been suspected not to fit into the relation between decline rate, colour, and brightness. However, an individual distance of its host galaxy, NGC4526, other than that of the Virgo cluster, has not yet been published. We determined the distance by the method of globular cluster luminosity functions on the basis of HST archive data. A maximum-likelihood fit returns apparent turn-over magnitudes of 23.16-0.16mag in V and 21.96-0.09mag in I. The corresponding distance modulus is 30.4-0.3mag, where the error reflects our estimation of the absolute distance scale. The absolute magnitudes (not corrected for decline rate and colour) are -18.67-0.30mag, -18.62-0.30mag, and -18.40-0.30mag for B, V, and I, respectively. The corrected magnitudes are -18.69-0.31mag, -18.69-0.31mag, and -18.44-0.31mag.   Compared with other supernovae with reliably determined distances, SN1994D fits within the errors.

More specifically we compute the number counts of clusters of galaxies, Log equation -- Log equation relation, in X-ray and submm bands on the basis of the Press--Schechter theory. As an important step toward breaking the degeneracy among the viable cosmological models, we observed the most luminous X-ray cluster RXJ1347-1145 in three bands (21 and 43 GHz in the Nobeyama Radio Observatory, Japan, and 350 GHz in the J.

astro-ph/9903243,astro-ph,The Super Soft Source RX J0925.7--4758 was observed by BeppoSAX LECS and MECS on January 25--26 1997. The source was clearly detected by the LECS but only marginally detected by the MECS. We apply detailed Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (Non-LTE) models including metal line opacities to the observed LECS spectrum. We test whether the X-ray spectrum of RX J0925 is consistent with that of a white dwarf and put constraints upon the effective temperature and surface gravity by considering the presence or absence of spectral features such as absorption edges and line blends in the models and the observed spectrum. We find that models with effective temperatures above ~1e6 K or below \~7.5e5 K can be excluded. If we assume a single model component for RX J0925 we observe a significant discrepancy between the model and the data above the NeIX edge energy at 1.19 keV. This is consistent with earlier observations with ROSAT and ASCA. The only way to account for the emission above ~1.2 keV is by introducing a second spectral (plasma) component. This plasma component may be explained by a shocked wind originating from the compact object or from the irradiated companion star. If we assume log g = 9 then the derived luminosity is consistent with that of a nuclear burning white dwarf at a distance of ~4 kpc.,1999,[],5
astro-ph/9912265,astro-ph,"We present high quality near infrared Color Magnitude Diagrams of 10 Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs) spanning a wide metallicity range (-2.15<[Fe/H]<-0.2). This homogeneous data-base has been used to perform a detailed analysis of the Red Giant Branch (RGB), adopting a variety of observables to describe its physical and chemical properties.   First, a set of metallicity indicators have been measured, namely: (i) the RGB (J-K) and (V-K) colors at different magnitude levels; (ii) the RGB K magnitude at different colors; (iii) the RGB slope. For these parameters we present new calibrations in terms of both spectroscopic iron abundance and global metallicity, including the alpha-element enhancement. These relations can be used to derive a photometric estimate of the GC metal content from the RGB morphology and location.   Second, the location in luminosity of the main RGB features (namely, the Bump and the Tip) and their dependence on metallicity have been studied, yielding quantitative observational relationships.   Finally, adopting new transformations between the observational and theoretical quantities, the mean ridge lines for the clusters of our sample have been reported in the (MBol, Log(Te)) plane. This allows to study the RGB location in terms of effective temperature, bolometric luminosity of the main RGB features, and their calibrations with varying metallicity. Direct comparisons between up-dated theoretical models and observations show an excellent overall agreement.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9905156,astro-ph,"We investigated the structures on scales beyond the typical clusters of galaxies. These structures are crucial to understand the cosmic gravitational clustering in the pre-virialized stage, or quasilinear r\`egime. Based on the multi-resolution analysis of the discrete wavelet transformation, we got statistical available ensembles of equation-clusters, i.e. the structures on scale equation, in the range equation Mpc for both N-body simulation and the IRAS 1.2 Jy galaxy survey samples. If the mass-to-light ratio on scales larger than clusters asymptotically reaches a constant, we found that the abundances and correlations of these IRAS equation-clusters to be basically consistent with the predictions of the flat low-density CDM model (LCDM) and the open CDM model (OCDM), except the model-predicted abundance of equation Mpc clusters seems to be higher than IRAS data. The standard CDM (SCDM) gives too much power, and too weak correlations on all the scales. For a given equation, the amplitude of two-point correlation function of equation-clusters is increasing with their richness. However, for a given richness (defined by the mean separation of neighbor objects), the clustering strengths of both simulation and observation sample are found to be declining with equation when equation is larger than 3 - 4 equation Mpc. Therefore, the 'universal' increase of the correlation amplitude with the scale of objects from galaxies, groups, to poor, rich clusters is broken down for structures of equation Mpc. Supercluster should not be a member of the 'universal' increase family.",1999,[],5

Part of the data were also taken during moonshine thus providing a nearly continuous coverage for this object in the TeV-range. We have carried out a QPO analysis and found evidence for a 23 day periodicity. We applied the same analysis on the 'data by dwell' x-ray lightcurve from the RXTE/ASM database and found also evidence for the 23 day periodicity.

astro-ph/9902109,astro-ph,"We test the recently published all-sky reddening map of Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998 [SFD]) using the extinction study of a region in the Taurus dark cloud complex by Arce & Goodman (1999 [AG]). In their study, AG use four different techniques to measure the amount and structure of the extinction toward Taurus, and all four techniques agree very well. Thus we believe that the AG results are a truthful representation of the extinction in the region and can be used to test the reliability of the SFD reddening map. The results of our test show that the SFD all-sky reddening map, which is based on data from COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA, overestimates the reddening by a factor of 1.3 to 1.5 in regions of smooth extinction with AV > 0.5 mag. In some regions of steep extinction gradients the SFD map underestimates the reddening value, probably due to its low spatial resolution. We expect that the astronomical community will be using the SFD reddening map extensively. We offer this Letter as a cautionary note about using the SFD map in regions of high extinction (AV > 0.5 mag), as it might not be giving accurate reddening values there.",1999,[],5

We find that if SL ~ u', where u' is the rms amplitude of turbulent velocity fluctuations, the local flame propagation speed does not significantly deviate from SL even in the presence of velocity fluctuations on scales below the laminar flame thickness.

astro-ph/9903371,astro-ph,"A detailed study of the Star Formation History of the Sgr dSph galaxy is performed through the analysis of the data from the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy Survey (SDGS; Bellazzini, Ferraro & Buonanno 1999). Accurate statistical decontamination of the SDGS Color - Magnitude diagrams allow us to obtain many useful constraints on the age and metal content of the Sgr stellar populations in three different region of the galaxy.   A coarse metallicity distribution of Sgr stars is derived, ranging from [Fe/H]~ -2.0 to [Fe/H]~ -0.7, the upper limit being somewhat higher in the central region of the galaxy. A qualitative global fit to all the observed CMD features is attempted, and a general scheme for the Star Formation History of the Sgr is derived. According to this scheme, star formation began at very early time from a low metal content Inter Stellar Medium and lasted for several Gyr, coupled with progressive chemical enrichment. The Star Formation Rate (SFR) had a peak from 8 to 10 gyr ago when the mean metallicity was in the range -1.3<= [Fe/H] <= -0.7. After that maximum, the SFR rapidly decreased and very low rate star formation took place until ~1-0.5 Gyr ago.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9902346,astro-ph,"The HST archival UV imaging polarimetry data of NGC 1068 is re-examined. Through an extensive estimation of the observational errors, we discuss whether the distribution of the position angles (PAs) of polarization is simply centrosymmetric or not. Taking into account the effect of a bad focus at the time of the observation, we conclude that, within the accuracy of HST/FOC polarimetry, the PA distribution is completely centrosymmetric. This means that the UV polarization originates only from scattering of the radiation from a central point-like source.   However, our analysis shows that the most probable location of the nucleus is only ~0.'08 (~6pc) south from the brightest cloud called 'cloud B'. The error circle of 99% confidence level extends to cloud B and to 'cloud A' which is about 0.'2 south of cloud B. By this FOC observation, Cloud B is only marginally rejected as the nucleus.   Assuming that the UV flux is dominated by electron-scattered light, we have also derived a three-dimensional structure of the nuclear region.

In particular, the quest for obtaining unambiguous gamma-ray signatures of cosmic ray ion acceleration defines a 'Holy Grail' for observers and theorists alike. This review summarizes theoretical developments in the prediction of MeV-TeV gamma-rays from supernova remnants over the last five years, focusing on how global properties of models can impact, and be impacted by, hard gamma-ray observational programs, thereby probing the supernova remnant environment. Properties of central consideration include the maximum energy of accelerated particles, the density of the unshocked interstellar medium, the ambient magnetic field, and the relativistic electron-to-proton ratio.

astro-ph/9907301,astro-ph,"We suggest that the Baldwin Effect is a result of the spectral dependence of the line-driving ionizing continuum on the black hole mass. We derive a relationship between the mass of the central black hole and the broad emission line luminosity in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Assuming the UV spectrum of AGN is emitted from an optically thick medium we find an expression for the characteristic energy of the 'UV bump' in terms of the observable luminosity and emission-line width. We show empirically and analytically that the bump energy is anti-correlated with the black-hole mass and with the continuum luminosity. Our model reproduces the observed inverse correlation between equivalent width and continuum luminosity, yielding an explanation of the Baldwin effect from first principles. The model gives a good fit to the Baldwin Effect of the CIV line for a mean quasar EUV spectrum (Zheng et al. 1997) and for several model spectra. The model also predicts a correlation between the strength of the Baldwin Effect (the slope of the equivalent width as a function of luminosity) and the ionization potential, consistent with recent data.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9911105,astro-ph,"Gravitational, magnetic and superfluid forces can stress the crust of an evolving neutron star. Fracture of the crust under these stresses could affect the star's spin evolution and generate high-energy emission. We study the growth of strain in the crust of a spinning down, magnetized neutron star and examine the initiation of crust cracking (a \em starquake). In preliminary work (Link, Franco & Epstein 1998), we studied a homogeneous model of a neutron star. Here we extend this work by considering a more realistic model of a solid, homogeneous crust afloat on a liquid core. In the limits of astrophysical interest, our new results qualitatively agree with those from the simpler model: the stellar crust fractures under shear stress at the rotational equator, matter moves to higher latitudes and the star's oblateness is reduced. Magnetic stresses favor faults directed toward the magnetic poles. Thus our previous conclusions concerning the star's spin response still hold; namely, asymmetric redistribution of matter excites damped precession which could ultimately lead to an increase in the spin-down torque.

The Fe abundance for IRS 7 was found to be close to solar, [Fe/H] = -0.02 /- 0.13, and nearly identical to the Fe abundances we obtained for the nearby M supergiants alpha Ori and VV Cep. Analysis of the first and second overtone lines of CO was used to derive an effective temperature of 3600 /- 230 K, a microturbulent velocity of 3.0 /- 0.3 km/s, and a carbon abundance log epsilon(C) = 7.78 /- 0.13, or [C/H] = -0.77. In addition, we find a high depletion of 0.74 /- 0.32 dex in O and an enhancement of 0.92 /- 0.18 dex in N. These abundances are consistent with the dredge-up of CNO-cycle products but require deep mixing in excess of that predicted by standard models for red supergiants. In light of our measured solar Fe abundance for IRS 7, we discuss other indicators of metallicity at the Galactic Center, the interpretation of low-resolution near-infrared spectra of late-type giants and supergiants, including the need for caution in using such spectra as measures of metallicity, and the evolution of massive young stars at the Galactic Center.

astro-ph/9903133,astro-ph,"We report on a short optical monitoring programme of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 Galaxy IRAS 13224-3809. Previous X-ray observations of this object have shown persistent giant variability. The degree of variability at other wavelengths may then be used to constrain the conditions and emission processes within the nucleus. Optical variability is expected if the electron population responsible for the soft X-ray emission is changing rapidly and Compton-upscattering infrared photons in the nucleus, or if the mechanism responsible for X-ray emission causes all the emission processes to vary together. We find that there is no significant optical variability with a firm upper limit of 2 per cent and conclude that the primary soft X-ray emission region produces little of the observed optical emission. The X-ray and optical emission regions must be physically distinct and any reprocessing of X-rays into the optical waveband occurs some distance from the nucleus. The lack of optical variability indicates that the energy density of infrared radiation in the nucleus is at most equal to that of the ultraviolet radiation since little is upscattered into the optical waveband. The extremely large X-ray variability of IRAS 13224-3809 may be explained by relativistic boosting of more modest variations. Although such boosting enhances X-ray variability over optical variability, this only partially explains the lack of optical variability.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9905171,astro-ph,"The recently observed bright optical transients(OT) of high redshift GRBs indicate that they are in a violent dynamical state. We think it is reasonable to assume that the GRBs form in the environment of gravitationally collapsed halos of the cosmic matter field, and we investigate the basic parameters of the halos which are favored to host GRBs. If the harboring coefficient equation of GRBs per halo is weakly dependent on the mass of the halo, the redshift data of GRB OTs can yield significant constraints on the massive halos hosting GRBs. We show that, in the framework of popular cold dark matter (CDM) models, the GRB-favored environments are newly collapsed halos (i.e. their ages less than about equation yr) with masses around equation equation Mequation. In this scenario, low redshift GRBs, if they exist, could not have the same cosmic origin as the high redshift ones. To fit with the observed rate of GRBs, we conclude that each GRB halo can host probably no more than one GRB event on average. This result implies that GRBs may be related to the merging of the halos.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9910486,astro-ph,"Two optical candidates - a galaxy and a star, are found within the error circle of the X-ray source position of an ultra-soft X-ray source discovered with ROSAT. Optical spectroscopy of the two candidates reveals that a) the galaxy is a narrow-line Seyfert type 1 galaxy, and b) the star is a late A-type or an early F-type. The Fx/Fopt ratio is too high for the star to be the counterpart of the X-ray source, but consistent with that for an active galaxy. Although higher resolution X-ray imaging of the region is needed to definitely settle the question of the counterpart of the X-ray source, the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy is the best candidate. The spectral properties of the newly discovered narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy are also presented, including its extreme X-ray power law spectral (photon) index > 4.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9905110,astro-ph,"We present a detailed analysis of the detached eclipsing binary CD Tau. A large variety of observational data, in form of IR photometry, CORAVEL radial velocity observations and high-resolution spectra, are combined with the published light curves to derive accurate absolute dimensions and effective temperature of the components, as well as the metal abundance of the system. We obtain: MA=1.442(16) Mo, RA=1.798(17) Ro, TeffA=6200(50) K, MB=1.368(16) Msun, RB=1.584(20) Run and TeffB=6200(50) K. The metal content of the system is determined to be [Fe/H]=0.08(15) dex. In addition, the eclipsing binary has a K-type close visual companion at about 10-arcsec separation, which is shown to be physically linked, thus sharing a common origin. The effective temperature of the visual companion (Teff=5250(200) K) is determined from synthetic spectrum fitting, and its luminosity (log L/Lo=-0.27(6)), and therefore its radius (R=0.89(9) Ro), are obtained from comparison with the apparent magnitude of the eclipsing pair. The observed fundamental properties of the eclipsing components are compared with the predictions of evolutionary models, and we obtain good agreement for an age of 2.6 Gyr and a chemical composition of Z=0.026 and Y=0.26. Furthermore, we test the evolutionary models for solar-mass stars and we conclude that the physical properties of the visual companion are very accurately described by the same isochrone that fits the more massive components.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9902135,astro-ph,"The complex time WKB (CWKB) approximation has been an effective technique to understand particle production in curved as well as in flat spacetime. Earlier we obtained the standard results on particle production in time dependent gauge in various curved spacetime. In the present work we generalize the technique of CWKB to the equivalent problems in space dependent gauge. Using CWKB, we first obtain the gauge invariant result for particle production in Minkowski spacetime in strong electric field. We then carry out particle production in de-Sitter spacetime in space dependent gauge and obtain the same result that we obtained earlier in time dependent gauge. The results obtained for de-Sitter spacetime has a obvious extension to particle production in black hole spacetime. It is found that the origin of Planckian spectrum is due to repeated reflections between the turning points. As mentioned earlier, it is now explicitly shown that particle production is accompanied by rotation of currents.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9911475,astro-ph,"We present quasi-simultaneous ASCA and RXTE observations of the most luminous known AGN in the local (z<0.3) Universe, the recently discovered quasar PDS 456. Multiwavelength observations have been conducted which show that PDS 456 has a bolometric luminosity of 1047 erg/s peaking in the UV part of the spectrum. In the X-ray band the 2-10 keV (rest-frame) luminosity is 1045 erg/s. The broad-band X-ray spectrum obtained with ASCA and RXTE contains considerable complexity. The most striking feature observed is a very deep, ionised iron K edge, observed at 8.7 keV in the quasar rest-frame. We find that these features are consistent with reprocessing from highly ionised matter, probably the inner accretion disk. PDS 456 appeared to show a strong (factor of 2.1) outburst in just 17ksec, although non-intrinsic sources cannot be completely ruled out. If confirmed, this would be an unusual event for such a high-luminosity source, with the light-crossing-time corresponding to 2 Schwarzschild radii. The implication would be that flaring occurs within the very central regions, or else that PDS 456 is a `super-Eddington' or relativistically beamed system. Overall we conclude on the basis of the extreme blue/UV luminosity, the rapid X-ray variability and from the imprint of highly ionised material on the X-ray spectrum, that PDS 456 is a quasar with an unusually high accretion rate.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9909049,astro-ph,"An optical spectrum of the Elson et al. (1998) candidate luminous white dwarf in the young LMC cluster NGC1818 shows conclusively that it is not a degenerate star. A model atmosphere fit gives T=31,500K and log g=4.4, typical of a garden-variety main sequence B star. However, if it is a true LMC member then the star is under-luminous by almost three magnitudes. Its position in the cluster colour-magnitude diagram also rules out the possibility that this is an ordinary B star. The luminosity is, however, consistent with a ~0.5 solar mass post-AGB or post-EHB object, although if it has evolved via single star evolution from a high mass (7.6-9.0 solar masses) progenitor then we might expect it to have a much higher mass, equation. Alternatively, it has evolved in a close binary. In this case the object offers no implications for the maximum mass for white dwarf progenitors, or the initial-final mass relation. Finally, we suggest that it could in fact be an evolved member of the LMC disk, and merely projected by chance onto NGC1818. Spectroscopically, though, we cannot distinguish between these evolutionary states without higher resolution (echelle) data.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9902069,astro-ph,"We estimate the deformation of the cosmic microwave background radiation by the hot region ('cocoon') around a radio galaxy. A simple model is adopted for cocoon evolution while the jet is on, and a model of evolution is constructed after the jet is off. It is found that at low redshift the phase after the jet is off is longer than the lifetime of the jets. The Compton y-parameter generated by cocoons is calculated with a Press-Schechter number density evolution. The resultant value of y is of the same order as the COBE constraint. The Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect due to cocoons could therefore be a significant foreground source of small angular scale anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation.",1999,[],5

Line profile modeling indicates supersonic inward motions vin>0.34 km/s over an extended region L>12000AU. The high infall speed and large extent exceeds the predictions of most thermal ambipolar diffusion models and points to a more dynamical process for core formation.

The techniques include (i) the determination of the height of the shower maximum, which is then taken into account in the energy determination, and (ii) the determination of the location of the shower core with the additional constraint that the direction of the gamma rays is known a priori. This constraint can be applied for gamma-ray point sources, and results in a significant improvement in the localization of the shower core, which translates into better energy resolution. Combining both techniques, the HEGRA telescopes reach an energy resolution between 9% and 12%, over the entire energy range from 1 TeV to almost 100 TeV. Options for further improvements of the energy resolution are discussed.",1999,[],5

Much of this progress is described in these workshop proceedings. Here we update the review article, summarizing the topics discussed at the workshop as well as covering the recent literature. We follow the outline of the review, describing HI properties in Sect. 2 and 3, interactions between HVCs and other gas in Sect. 4, observations at wavelengths other than 21-cm in Sects. 5 and 6, absorption-line studies of metallicities and distances in Sects. 7 and 8, extra-galactic HVCs in Sect. 9, the Magellanic Stream in Sect. 10, and a discussion of HVC origins in Sect. 11.

For a thermal distribution of electrons with a kinetic temperature of 10 keV and a bulk peculiar velocity of 1000 km/s, the dominant corrections to the polarization induced by the primordial CMB quadrupole and the cluster peculiar velocity arise from electron thermal motion and are at the level of 10 per cent in each case, near the peak of the polarization signal.

astro-ph/9903411,astro-ph,"We incorporate quasars into an analytic model to describe the reheating and reionization of the universe. In combination with a previous study of galaxies and Lyman-equation clouds, we are able to provide a unified description of structure formation, verified against a large variety of observations. We also take into account the clumping of the baryonic gas in addition to the presence of collapsed objects. We consider two cosmologies: a critical universe with a CDM power-spectrum and an open universe with equation, equation. The derived quasar luminosity function agrees reasonably well with observations at equation and with constraints over larger redshifts from the HDF. The radiation produced by these objects at equation slowly reheats the universe which gets suddenly reionized at equation for the open universe (equation for the critical density universe). The UV background radiation simultaneously increases sharply to reach a maximum of equation at equation, but shows strong ionization edges until equation. The metallicity of the gas increases quickly at high equation and is already larger than equation at equation. The QSO number counts and the helium opacity constrain the reionization redshift to be equation. We confirm that a population of faint quasars is needed in order to satisfy the observations. Due to the low reionization redshift, the damping of CMB fluctuations is quite small, but future observations (e.g. with the NGST) of the multiplicity functions of radiation sources and of the HI and HeII opacities will strongly constrain scenarios in which reionization is due to QSOs.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9902029,astro-ph,"Models of Blazars based on the propagation of finite discontinuities or fronts in the Poynting flux jet from the innermost regions of an accretion disk around a black hole are discussed. Such fronts may be responsible for short time-scale (from less than hours to days) flares in different wavebands from high frequency radioband to TeV, with delay in low radio frequencies as a result of synchrotron self-absorption. The cases of magnetic fields of one and opposite polarities across the front are investigated. We find that annihilation of magnetic field in the front leads to higher energy spectrum of leptons and possibility of strong TeV flares. Electron-positron pairs form in most cases as a result of interaction between numerous synchrotron photons and SSC photons, and constitute the majority species, compared with the ions at subparsec scales. Frequent weak outbursts may be responsible for flickering core radiation in all wavebands, while the stronger outbursts may be observed as short time-scale flares.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9910497,astro-ph,"Using a combination of radio and optical imaging at 0.1\arcs to 0.2\arcs resolution with the VLA/MERLIN and HST has led to a breakthrough in our understanding of radio emission from distant (0.1<z<3) starburst galaxies. We have recently isolated a number of high redshift, dusty starburst galaxies that remain invisible in ground based images to IAB=25 and IAB=28.5 in the Hubble Deep Field. These galaxies appear as faint radio sources, often accompanied by very red counterparts (I-K > 4-6) and submillimeter sources with S > 2 mJy at 850 microns as measured with SCUBA on the JCMT. The far-infrared luminosities of these galaxies exceeds even the most intense starbursts found in the local universe (e.g., Arp 220), suggesting they are in the process of converting the bulk of their gass mass into stars.   These galaxies, completely absent in optical surveys, constitute 50% - 90% of the star-formation density in the distant Universe. Given the poor sub-mm resolution (15\arcs) of the SCUBA/JCMT images, we use the 0.2\arcs radio imaging as a surrogate in order to understand the nature of the dominant emission mechanism driving the FIR luminosity (AGN vs. star-formation). Upcoming developments in radio instrumentation (the Expanded VLA Array and Square Kilometer Array) will soon increase sensitivity and resolution orders of magnitude, providing a natural complement to parallel developments in sub-mm facilities (e.g., ALMA). With dual radio continuum and sub-mm surveys of the distant Universe, a census of galaxy evolution to the earliest cosmic epochs (z = 5-30) will soon be possible.",1999,[],5

The artificial sky brightness in each site at a given position on the sky is obtained by integration of the contributions produced by every surface area in the surroundings of the site. Each contribution is computed taking into account based on detailed models the propagation in the atmosphere of the upward light flux emitted by the area and measured by the Operational Linescan System of DMSP satellites.

astro-ph/9911447,astro-ph,"We combine predictions for several hierarchical cosmogonies with observational evidence on damped Lyman alpha systems to establish a correspondence between the high redshift galaxy population and the properties of damped Lyman alpha systems. We assume that high redshift galaxies and damped Lyman alpha systems are hosted by the same dark matter halos and require consistency between the predicted halo space density, the rate of incidence and the velocity width distribution of damped Lyman alpha systems, and the observed galaxy luminosity function at the bright end. We arrive at the following results: (1) predicted impact parameters between the damped absorption system and the luminous part of the absorbing galaxy are expected to be very small (0.3 - 1arcsec) for most galaxies; (2) luminosities of galaxies causing damped absorption are generally fainter than mR = 25 and damped Lyman alpha systems are predicted to sample preferentially the outer regions of galaxies at the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function at high redshift.

astro-ph/9909494,astro-ph,"High dynamic range imaging of submillimeter dust emission from the envelopes of eight young protostars in the Taurus and Perseus star-forming regions has been carried out using the SCUBA submillimeter camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Good correspondence between the spectral classifications of the protostars and the spatial distributions of their dust emission is observed, in the sense that those with cooler spectral energy distributions also have a larger fraction of the submillimeter flux originating in an extended envelope compared with a disk. This results from the cool sources having more massive envelopes rather than warm sources having larger disks. Azimuthally-averaged radial profiles of the dust emission are used to derive the power-law index of the envelope density distributions, p (defined by rho proportional to r-p), and most of the sources are found to have values of p consistent with those predicted by models of cloud collapse. However, the youngest protostars in our sample, L1527 and HH211-mm, deviate significantly from the theoretical predictions, exhibiting values of p somewhat lower than can be accounted for by existing models. For L1527 heating of the envelope by shocks where the outflow impinges on the surrounding medium may explain our result. For HH211-mm another explanation is needed, and one possibility is that a shallow density profile is being maintained in the outer envelope by magnetic fields and/or turbulence. If this is the case star formation must be determined by the rate at which the support is lost from the cloud, rather than the hydrodynamical properties of the envelope, such as the sound speed.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9909235,astro-ph,"We present results of a comprehensive study of the distribution of absorption dips with orbital phase in Cygnus X-1. Firstly, the distribution was obtained using archival data from all major X-ray observatories and corrected for the selection effect that phase zero (superior conjunction of the black hole) has been preferentially observed. Dip occurrence was seen to vary strongly with orbital phase letter, with a peak at letter ~ 0.95, i.e. was not symmetric about phase zero. Secondly, the RXTE ASM has provided continuous coverage of the Low State of Cygnus X-1 since Sept. 1996, and we have selected dip data based on increases in hardness ratio. The distribution, with much increased numbers of dip events, confirms that the peak is at letter ~ 0.95, and we report the discovery of a second peak at letter ~ 0.6. We attribute this peak to absorption in an accretion stream from the companion star HDE 226868. We have estimated the ionization parameter at different positions showing that radiative acceleration of the wind is suppressed by photoionization in particular regions in the binary system. To obtain the variation of column density with phase, we make estimates of neutral wind density for the extreme cases that acceleration of the wind is totally suppressed, or not suppressed at all. An accurate description will lie between these extremes. In each case, a strong variation of column density with orbital phase resulted, similar to the variation of dip occurrence. This provides evidence that formation of the blobs in the wind which lead to absorption dips depends on the density of the neutral component in the wind, suggesting possible mechanisms for blob growth.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9902226,astro-ph,"We discuss how to use tidal streams from globular clusters to measure the mass distribution of the Milky Way. Recent proper motion determinations for globular clusters from plate measurements and Hipparcos astrometry provide several good candidates for Galactic mass determinations in the intermediate halo, far above the Galactic disk, including Pal 5, NGC 4147, NGC 5024 (M53) and NGC 5466; the remaining Hipparcos clusters provide candidates for measurements several kpc above and below the disk. These clusters will help determine the profile and shape of the inner halo. To aid this effort, we present two methods of mass determination: one, a generalization of rotation-curve mass measurements, which gives the mass and potential from complete position-velocity observations for stream stars; and another using a simple chi2 estimator, which can be used when only projected positions and radial velocities are known for stream stars. We illustrate the use of the latter method using simulated tidal streams from Pal 5 and find that fairly accurate mass determinations are possible even for relatively poor data sets. Follow-up observations of clusters with proper motion determinations may reveal tidal streams; obtaining radial velocity measurements would enable accurate measurements of the mass distribution in the inner Galaxy.",1999,[],5

Larson's law (\citeyearLarson81) equation and the plausible assumption of virial equilibrium justify to consider fractals as a possible description of the ISM. In the following we investigate how self-gravitation, differential rotation and dissipation affect the matter distribution in galaxies. To this end we have performed 3D-simulations for self-gravitating local boxes embedded in a larger disk, extending the 2D-method of Toomre & Kalnajs (\citeyearToomre91) and Wisdom & Tremaine (\citeyearWisdom88).

astro-ph/9907386,astro-ph,"Relatively uniform light curves and spectral evolution of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have led to the use of SNe Ia as a 'standard candle' to determine cosmological parameters, such as the Hubble constant, the density parameter, and the cosmological constant. Whether a statistically significant value of the cosmological constant can be obtained depends on whether the peak luminosities of SNe Ia are sufficiently free from the effects of cosmic and galactic evolutions. Here we first review the single degenerate scenario for the Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf (WD) models of SNe Ia. We identify the progenitor's evolution and population with two channels: (1) the WDRG (red-giant) and (2) the WDMS (near main-sequence He-rich star) channels. In these channels, the strong wind from accreting white dwarfs plays a key role, which yields important age and metallicity effects on the evolution. We then address the questions whether the nature of SNe Ia depends systematically on environmental properties such as metallicity and age of the progenitor system and whether significant evolutionary effects exist. We suggest that the variation of the carbon mass fraction equation(C) in the CO WD (or the variation of the initial WD mass) causes the diversity of the brightness of SNe Ia. This model can explain the observed dependence of SNe Ia brighness on the galaxy types. Finally, applying the metallicity effect on the evolution of SN Ia progenitors, we make a prediction of the cosmic supernova rate history as a composite of the supernova rates in different types of galaxies.",1999,[],5

The CO data show the presence of massive molecular gas reservoirs (M(H2) few X 1010-1011 M(sun)) and suggest that the sub-mm galaxies are similar to low-redshift, gas-rich ultraluminous infrared galaxies.

We find that both models fit the data well and it is not possible to differentiate between them by fitting only the ASCA data. The best fit temperature and optical depth of the cloud are found to be kT = 0.54 keV and equation from the Comptonization model. This model further suggests that while the temperature can be assumed to be constant, the optical depth varies during the observation period.

We also map `observable' projected properties such as the surface mass density, X-ray surface brightness and SZ signature. We identify significant differences between the simulations, which highlights the need for caution when comparing numerical simulations to observations of galaxy clusters. While resolution affects the inner density profile in dark matter simulations, the addition of a gaseous component, especially one that cools and forms stars, affects the entire cluster. We conclude that both resolution and included physical processes play an important role in simulating the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters. Therefore, physical inferences drawn from simulations that do not include a gaseous component that can cool and form stars present a poor representation of reality. (Abridged)",1999,[],5

The velocity dispersion generated by two-body relaxation is considered. The ratio is given as a function of a disc potential parameter, kappa/Omega, where kappa and Omega are the epicycle and circular frequencies (the parameters kappa/Omega=1 and 2 correspond to Kepler rotation and solid-body rotation). For 1 <= kappa/Omega <~ 1.5, the velocity dispersion increases keeping some anisotropy (sigmaz / sigmaR ~ 0.5-0.7) if the amplitude of radial excursion is larger than tidal radius, while sigmaz / sigmaR << 1 for smaller amplitude. On the other hand, for 1.5 <~ kappa/Omega <= 2.0, we found isotropic state (sigmaz / sigmaR ~ 1) in the intermediate velocity regime, while anisotropic state (sigmaz / sigmaR < 1) still exists for higher and lower velocity regimes. The range of the intermediate velocity regime expands with kappa/Omega. In the limit of solid-body rotation, the regime covers all over the velocity space. Thus, the velocity dispersion generally has two different anisotropic states for each disc potential (1 <= kappa/Omega < 2) and one isotropic state for 1.5 <~ kappa/Omega < 2 where the individual states correspond to different amplitude of velocity dispersion, while in the limit of solid-body rotation (kappa/Omega = 2.0), entire velocity space is covered by the isotropic state.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9906308,astro-ph,"The star formation history derived from ultraviolet and Hequation data, without correction for dust extinction, on the one hand, and from far infrared and submillimetre data, on the other, is investigated. The latter estimates are found to be a factor 2-3 higher than the former, consistent with 2/3-3/4 of the uv light in star forming regions being absorbed by dust and reemitted in the far infrared. A reanalysis of the Hubble Deep Field galaxies using photometric reshifts shows no evidence for a decline in star formation rate at z = 2-4.   A simple and versatile parameterized approach to the star formation history allows a quantitative investigation of the constraints from far infrared and submillimetre counts and background intensity measurements. A good fit to the counts, the 850 equationm background and the star formation history can be found in an equation = 1 universe, but this model fails to account for even the lowest estimates of the 140-350 equationm background by a factor of 2.

astro-ph/9909275,astro-ph,"We have developed an improved recombination calculation of H, HeI, and HeII in the early Universe which involves a line-by-line treatment of each atomic level. We find two major differences compared with previous calculations. Firstly, the ionization fraction xe is approximately 10% smaller for redshifts <~800, due to non-equilibrium processes in the excited states of H. Secondly, HeI recombination is much slower than previously thought, and is delayed until just before H recombines. We describe the basic physics behind the new results and present a simple way to reproduce our calculation. This should enable fast computation of the ionization history (and quantities such as the power spectrum of CMB anisotropies which depend on it) for arbitrary cosmologies, without the need to consider the hundreds of atomic levels used in our complete model.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9911082,astro-ph,We consider the centrifugal acceleration of charged test particles by rotating magnetospheres which are widely believed to be responsible for the relativistic jet phenomenon in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Based on an analysis of forces the equation for the radial accelerated motion is derived and an analytical solution presented under the assumption of an idealized spherical magnetosphere. We show that the rotational energy gain of charged particles moving outwards along rotating magnetic field lines is limited in general by (i) inverse-Compton losses in the radiation field of the disk in which the magnetosphere is anchored and (ii) the breakdown of the bead-on-the-wire approximation which occurs in the vicinity of the light cylinder. The corresponding maximum Lorentz factor for electrons is of the order of a few hundred for the sub-Eddington conditions regarded to be typical for BL Lacs. In AGN with enhanced accretion rate the acceleration mechanism seems to be almost inefficient due to increasing inverse-Compton losses.,1999,[],5

Coherent X-ray pulsations of 323.1 /- 0.3 s were discovered from AX J0051-733. The pulse profile shows several sub-peaks in the soft (0.7-2.0 keV) X-ray band, but becomes nearly sinusoidal in the harder (2.0-7.0 keV) X-ray band. The X-ray spectrum was found to be hard, and is well fitted by a power-law model with a photon index of 1.0 /- 0.4.

We found the object to be polarized at about 2%, and constant with wavelength, (unlike most narrow-line Seyfert 1s), but with no evidence of broad Balmer lines in polarized flux.

astro-ph/9909205,astro-ph,"While X-ray measurements have so far revealed an increase in the volume-averaged baryon fractions equation of galaxy clusters with cluster radii equation, equation should asymptotically reach a universal value equation, provided that clusters are representative of the Universe. In the framework of hydrostatic equilibrium for intracluster gas, we have derived the necessary conditions for equation: The X-ray surface brightness profile described by the equation model and the temperature profile approximated by the polytropic model should satisfy equation and equation for equation and equation, respectively, which sets a stringent limit to the polytropic index: equation. In particular, a mildly increasing temperature with radius is required if the observationally fitted equation parameter is in the range equation. It is likely that a reliable determination of the universal baryon fraction can be achieved in the small equation clusters because the disagreement between the exact and asymptotic baryon fractions for clusters with equation breaks down at rather large radii (equation) where hydrostatic equilibrium has probably become inapplicable. We further explore how to obtain the asymptotic value equation of baryon fraction from the X-ray measurement made primarily over the finite central region of a cluster. We demonstrate our method using a sample of 19 strong lensing clusters, which enables us to place a useful constraint on equation: equation. An optimal estimate of equation based on three cooling flow clusters with equation in our lensing cluster sample yields equation or equation.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9912045,astro-ph,Angular fluctuations of stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (GWB) produced by extragalactic astrophysical sources are calculated. The angular properties of such backgrounds are determined by the large scale structure of Universe (galaxy clustering). The evolution of star formation rate with redshift is taken into account. Fluctuations of the metric strain amplitude associated with such noises at angular scales of about one degree are found to be of order 5-20% slowly growing toward smaller angular scales. This feature can be potentially used to separate astrophysical GWB from cosmological ones in future experiments.,1999,[],5

Optical photometric and spectroscopic data are also available for this sample. A statistical approach is employed to identify candidate physical associations between radio sources and optically selected `field' galaxies.

astro-ph/9902190,astro-ph,"We report on the very early time search for an optical afterglow from GRB 971227 with the Livermore Optical Transient Imaging System (LOTIS). LOTIS began imaging the `Original' BATSE error box of GRB 971227 approximately 14 s after the onset of gamma-ray emission. Continuous monitoring of the position throughout the evening yielded a total of 499 images (10 s integration). Analysis of these images revealed no steady optical afterglow brighter than R=12.3 - 0.2 in any single image. Coaddition of different combinations of the LOTIS images also failed to uncover transient optical emission. In particular, assuming a constant early time flux, no optical afterglow brighter than R=14.2 - 0.2 was present within the first 1200 s and no optical afterglow brighter than R=15.0 - 0.2 was present in the first 6.0 h.   Follow up observations by other groups revealed a likely X-ray afterglow and a possible optical afterglow. Although subsequent deeper observations could not confirm a fading source, we show that these transients are not inconsistent with our present knowledge of the characteristics of GRB afterglows. We also demonstrate that with the upgraded thermoelectrically cooled CCDs, LOTIS is capable of either detecting very early time optical afterglow or placing stringent constraints on the relationship between the gamma-ray emission and the longer wavelength afterglow in relativistic blast wave models.",1999,[],5

The line-free continuum was found to be extremely compact and symmetric while the emission-line nebulae seen in H-alpha[N II] show very clumpy structures spreading almost linearly over 16 kpc. However, this linear structure is clearly misaligned from the radio axis. The SED of the line-free continuum is very flat, suggesting that if the continuum emission is produced by a single source, it is likely to be a young bursting stellar population or scattered AGN light. However, because of the lack of a line-free optical image with a comparable spatial resolution, we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed SED is a composite of a young blue population and an old red population.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9906008,astro-ph,"The continuum shape of 26 broad absorption line (BAL) QSOs is shown to be virtually identical to that of non-BAL QSOs when the spectra of the former are dereddened. A procedure for dereddening of BAL QSO spectra is introduced, based on measurement of the flux in three bands and determination of the colour excess in comparison with an unreddened spectrum. This method allows us to derive the type and amount of extinction. We show that reddening in high-ionization BAL QSOs is comparatively small and the range of extinction laws varies from Milky Way, LMC to SMC type. On the other hand, low-ionization BAL QSOs seem to experience reddening which can be attributed to SMC type extinction alone. Comparison of the colour indices of composite spectra from Francis etal. (1991) and Zheng etal. (1997) with those derived from individual BAL QSO spectra shows that the Francis etal. (1991) composite might be a more suitable representative of an unreddened spectrum. In general, we conclude that the spectral energy distribution of normal QSOs can be used as an incident continuum shape for BAL QSOs.",1999,[],5

Most of these structures (predicted and unexpected) have only recently been made 'visible' through dedicated deep surveys at various wavelengths.

Particular emphasis is given to the Great Attractor region where the existence of yet another cluster is suspected (Woudt 1998). Predictions from reconstructions of the density field in the ZOA are discussed and compared with observational evidence.

astro-ph/9901341,astro-ph,"Determination of microlensing parameters in the gravitationally lensed quasar Q22370305 from the statistics of high magnification events will require monitoring for more than 100 years (Wambsganss, Paczynski & Schneider 1990). However we show that the effective transverse velocity of the lensing galaxy can be determined on a more realistic time-scale through consideration of the distribution of light-curve derivatives. The 10 years of existing monitoring data for Q22370305 are analysed. These data display strong evidence for microlensing that is not associated with a high magnification event. An upper limit of v < 500 km/sec is obtained for the galactic transverse velocity which is smaller than previously assumed values. The analysis suggests that the observed microlensing variation may be predominantly due to stellar proper motions. The statistical significance of the results obtained from our method will be increased by the addition of data points from current and future monitoring campaigns. However reduced photometric errors will be more valuable than an increased sampling rate.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9905016,astro-ph,"We report photometry and spectroscopy of the evolution of Nova Sagittarii 1994 #1 (V4332 Sagittarii) during outburst. We compare the photometric and spectral evolution of this outburst to known classes of outbursts -- including classical novae and outbursts occurring on symbiotic stars -- and find this object does NOT conform to any known class of outburst. The closest match to the behavior of this unusual object is M31 RV, an extremely luminous and red variable object discovered in the bulge of M31 in 1988. However, the temporal behavior and maximum luminosity of the two events differ by several orders of magnitude, requiring substantial intrinsic variation if these two events are members the same type of outburst.   Our model of the spectroscopic evolution of this outburst shows that the effective temperature cooled from 4400 K to 2300 K over the three month span of our observations. In combination with line diagnostics in our later spectra, including [OI] lambda 5577 and the dramatic increase in the Halpha to Hbeta ratio, we infer the existence of a cool, dense (Ne ~ 108-9 cm-3) envelope that is optically thick in the Hydrogen Balmer recombination lines (case C).

astro-ph/9904130,astro-ph,"Longitude-velocity (l-V) diagrams of H I and CO gas in the inner Milky Way have long been known to be inconsistent with circular motion in an axisymmetric potential. Several lines of evidence suggest that the Galaxy is barred, and gas flow in a barred potential could be consistent with the observed 'forbidden' velocities and other features in the data. We compare the H I observations to l-V diagrams synthesized from 2-D fluid dynamical simulations of gas flows in a family of barred potentials. The gas flow pattern is very sensitive to the parameters of the assumed potential, which allows us to discriminate among models. We present a model that reproduces the outer contour of the H I l-V diagram reasonably well; this model has a strong bar with a semimajor axis of 3.6 kpc, an axis ratio of approximately 3:1, an inner Lindblad resonance (ILR), and a pattern speed of 42 km/s/kpc, and matches the data best when viewed from 34\deg to the bar major axis. The behavior of the models, combined with the constraint that the shocks in the Milky Way bar should resemble those in external barred galaxies, leads us to conclude that wide ranges of parameter space are incompatible with the observations. In particular we suggest that the bar must be fairly strong, must have an ILR, and cannot be too end-on, with the bar major axis at 35\deg /- 5\deg to the line of sight. The H I data exhibit larger forbidden velocities over a wider longitude range than are seen in molecular gas; this important difference is the reason our favored model differs so significantly from other recently proposed models.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9906453,astro-ph,"A possible discrepancy found in the determination of mass from gravitational lensing data, and from X-rays observations, has been largely discussed in the latest years (for instance, Miralda-Escude & Babul (1995)). Another important discrepancy related to these data is that the dark matter is more centrally condensed than the X-ray-emitting gas, and also with respect to the galaxy distribution (Eyles et al. 1991). Could these discrepancies be consequence of the standard description of the ICM, in which it is assumed hydrostatic equilibrium maintained by thermal pressure? We follow the evolution of the ICM, considering a term of magnetic pressure, aiming at answering the question whether or not these discrepancies can be explained via non-thermal terms of pressure. Our results suggest that the magnetic pressure could only affect the dynamics of the ICM on scales as small as < 1kpc. Our models are constrained by the observations of large and small scale fields and we are successful at reproducing available data, for both Faraday rotation limits and inverse Compton limits for the magnetic fields. In our calculations the radius (from the cluster center) in which magnetic pressure reaches equipartition is smaller than radii derived in previous works, as a consequence of the more realistic treatment of the magnetic field geometry and the consideration of a sink term in the cooling flow.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9903306,astro-ph,"We present an analysis of the RXTE observations of the recently discovered Galactic microquasar XTE J1748--288 during its 1998 outburst. The spectral evolution of the source during the outburst can be considered a sequence of qualitatively distinct states. During the first observations, corresponding to the maximum of X-ray flux, the spectrum of the source consisted of a dominating hard power law component and a soft thermal component, which can be described by the model of multicolor disk emission. The hard component contributed >80% to the X-ray luminosity in the 3-25 keV energy band. Overall two-component spectral shape is an attribute of Very High state (VHS) observed previously in BHC, but the domination of hard component is unusual. Later on, as the X-ray source faded, its energy spectrum qualitatively changed, showing High (HS) and then Low (LS) states, both typical for black hole binaries. As the energy spectrum changed, the fast variability also evolved dramatically. Initially the power density spectrum was formed by a dominating band-limited noise component, QPO features at 20-30 Hz and at ~0.5 Hz, and a very low frequency noise component. After a significant decrease of the contribution of the hard spectral component the amplitude of the fractional variability decreased by an order of magnitude and the PDS spectrum adopted a power-law shape with a broad QPO peak around 0.03 Hz. When the system switched to the LS, the PDS shape changed again and the QPOs have not been detected since. When the source was observed in VHS, a clear correlation between QPO parameters and X-ray flux was seen.",1999,[],5

The adopted chemical compositions cover the typical galactic values, namely equation and equation. A comparison among the most recent compilations of similar stellar models is also discussed. The main conclusion is that the differencies among the various evolutionary results are still rather large. For example, we found that the H-burning evolutionary time may differ up to 20 %. An even larger disagreement is found for the He-burning phase (up to 40-50 %). Since the connection between the various input physics and the numerical algorithms could amplify or counterbalance the effect of a single ingredient on the resulting stellar model, the origin of this discrepancies is not evident. However most of these discrepancies, which are clearly found in the evolutionary tracks, are reduced on the isochrones. By means of our updated models we show that the ages inferred by the theory of stellar evolution is in excellent agreement with those obtained by using other independent methods applied to the nearby Open Clusters.

We have measured this cut-off in a sample of nine high resolution, high signal-to-noise quasar spectra, and determined the thermal evolution of the intergalactic medium in the redshift range 2.0-4.5.

Further there is no statistical evidence for homogeneity at any of the larger scales (up to ~150 Mpc/h) probed more weakly by the catalog. These results means that characteristic 'correlation lengths' for the clustering of galaxies derived using standards methods of analysis are not meaningful. Further the results are very consistent with those obtained from many other catalogs using the methods adopted here, which show the D =2 fractal continuing to beyond 100 Mpc/h.

The shock wave structure is considered in terms of the self-consistent solution of the radiation transfer, fluid dynamics and rate equations for 2 <= L <= 4 atomic bound levels with a continuum. The radiative flux Frad emergent from the shock wave was found to be independent of the lower limit nuL of the frequency range provided that nuL < nu2, where nu2 is the Balmer continuum head frequency, At the same time the decrease of nuL is accompanied by decrease of the Lyman continuum flux and leads to smaller heating and weaker ionization of the hydrogen gas in the radiative precursor. For all models the size of the radiative precursor is of 104 cm and corresponds to several mean free paths of photons at the frequency of the Lyman continuum edge nu1. The compression ratio at the discontinuous jump gradually increases with increasing upstream velocity U1, reaches the maximum of letter/letter- = 3.62 at U1 = 55 km/s and slowly decreases for larger U1 due to the strong rize of the preshock gas temperature. The radiative flux from the shock wave was determined as a function of the upstream velocity U1 and its ratio to the total energy flux in the shock wave C2 was found to range within 0.18 < Frad/C2 < 0.92 for 15 km/s <= U1 <= 65 km/s. Thus, at upstream velocities U1 > 60 km/s the shock wave losses more than 90% of its total energy due to radiation.

astro-ph/9904331,astro-ph,"Fast spinning neutron stars, recycled in low mass binaries, may have accreted a substantial amount of mass. The available relativistic measurements of neutron star masses, all clustering around 1.4 Msun, however refer mostly to slowly rotating neutron stars which accreted a tiny amount of mass during evolution in a massive binary system. We develop a semi-analytical model for studying the evolution of the spin period P of a magnetic neutron star as a function of the baryonic mass load Mac; evolution is followed down to submillisecond periods and the magnetic field is allowed to decay significantly before the end of recycling. We use different equations of state and include rotational deformation effects, the presence of a strong gravitational field and of a magnetosphere. For the non-magnetic case, comparison with numerical relativistic codes shows the accuracy of our description. The minimum accreted mass requested to spin-up a magnetized 1.35Msun-neutron star at a few millisecond is 0.05 Msun, while this value doubles for an unmagnetized neutron star. Below 1 millisecond the request is of at least 0.25 Msun. There may exist a yet undetected population of massive submillisecond neutron stars.

Richness measurements indicate that these clusters are typical of the majority of those found in the Abell (1958) catalog, with a range of Abell richness classes from 0 to 2. The line-of-sight velocity dispersions are very different from cluster to cluster, ranging from approximately 300 to 1100 km/s. At the upper end of these intervals, we may be sampling some of the highest-redshift massive clusters known.

astro-ph/9903409,astro-ph,"We present the first interferometric CO observations of the barred late-type galaxy UGC2855 and its companion UGC2866. UGC2855 is shown to belong to the rare class of galaxies with a long (~ 8kpc) continuous molecular bar. The velocity field along the bar is dominated by solid-body rotation and shows few perturbations. This, together with an almost constant and low 12CO/13CO line intensity ratio along the bar and in the center as well as only weak H alpha emission, indicate that the gas in the bar is not subjected to strong shocks, but surprisingly quiescent. In the central 3', a high velocity feature consisting of a number of Giant Molecular Associations, is identified. We discuss possible scenarios of the nature of this structure in connection with the question of the presence of an Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR) in the bar. We suggest that the bar of UGC2855 is a young object, possibly has no ILR, and that the mass concentration toward the center of the galaxy is just beginning. In contrast, the companion UGC2866 experiences a strong starburst. We compare the properties of the gas in the bar of UGC2855 to those we find in NGC7479. Despite superficial parallels, the two bars are very dissimilar objects in terms of 12CO/13CO line ratio, velocity field and H alpha activity.

astro-ph/9912519,astro-ph,"In this paper we report strong evidence for a ~304-day periodicity in the spin history of the accretion-powered pulsar GX 14 that is very likely to be a signature of the orbital period of the system. Using BATSE public-domain data, we show a highly-significant periodic modulation of the pulsar frequency from 1991 to date which is in excellent agreement with the ephemeris proposed by Cutler, Dennis & Dolan in 1986, which were based on a few events of enhanced spin-up that occurred during the pulsar's spin-up era in the 1970s. Our results indicate that the orbital period of GX 14 is 303.8-1.1 days, making it by far the widest low-mass X-ray binary system known. A likely scenario for this system is an elliptical orbit in which the neutron star decreases its spin-down rate (or even exhibits a momentary spin-up behavior) at periastron passages due to the higher torque exerted by the accretion disk onto the magnetosphere of the neutron star.",1999,[],5

Coherent radiation by such Compton electrons follows nuclear explosions above the Earth's atmosphere. Particle acceleration in instabilities produced by Compton electron currents may explain the radio emission by SN1998bw. Bounds on coherent radiation are suggested for supernovae and gamma-ray bursts; these bounds are very high, but it is unknown if coherent radiation occurs in these objects.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9905054,astro-ph,"Recently, convincing evidence was found for extremely large X-ray absorption by column densities equation in broad absorption line quasars. One consequence of this is that any soft X-ray emission from these QSOs would be the scattered light or leaked light from partially covering absorbing material. A detection of the unabsorbed soft X-ray and absorbed hard X-ray compo nent will allow to determine the total column density as well as the effective covering factor of the absorbing material, which can be hardly obtained from the UV absorption lines. Brinkmann et al. (1999) showed that both the unabsorbed and absorbed components are detected in the nearby very bright broad absorption line quasar PG 1411442. In this letter, we make a further analysis of the broad band X-ray spectrum and the UV spectrum from HST, and demonstrate that broad absorption lines are completely saturated at the bottom of absorption troughs.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9909290,astro-ph,"We compare the evolution with cosmic time of the star-formation rate per comoving volume in galaxies and of the volume emissivity by Active Galactic Nuclei, as a clue to understand the relationship between black hole accretion and the formation of the surrounding structure. We find an interesting similarity between the evolution rates for the total populations of galaxies and AGNs, which indicates that, on average, the history of BH accretion tracks that of stellar formation in the hosting galaxies. Similarly, the evolution of luminous quasars parallels that of the stellar populations in massive spheroidal galaxies, in keeping with the locally established association of supermassive BHs and galactic bulges. We finally comment on our finding that high-luminosity, high-mass systems evolve on a faster cosmic timescale than the lower mass ones: to explain this, the theories of structure formation based on the gravitational collapse of dark matter halos have to be complemented with a detailed description of the dynamical processes in the baryonic component, which dominate the formation and evolution in high-density environments.",1999,[],5

The maximum mass of the non-rotating hybrid star turns out to be 1.6 Ms. Possible signatures of the quark phase as pulsar's timing, cooling rate etc. are briefly analyzed. The deconfinement transition can also take place during the pre-supernova collapse. This possibility is studied by introducing a finite temperature EOS. The dependence of the latter on the proton fraction is shown to be crucial. The softening of the EOS at densities just above nuclear matter saturation density for Z/A = 0.3 helps in obtaining an explosion. At the same time, at larger densities the EOS is stiff enough to support a neutron star compatible with observations.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9904248,astro-ph,"We review millimeter interferometric phase variations caused by variations in the precipitable water vapor content of the troposphere, and we discuss techniques proposed to correct for these variations. We present observations with the Very Large Array at 22 GHz and 43 GHz designed to test these techniques. We find that both the Fast Switching and Paired Array calibration techniques are effective at reducing tropospheric phase noise for radio interferometers. In both cases, the residual rms phase fluctuations after correction are independent of baseline length for b > beff. These techniques allow for diffraction limited imaging of faint sources on arbitrarily long baselines at mm wavelengths. We consider the technique of tropospheric phase correction using a measurement of the precipitable water vapor content of the troposphere via a radiometric measurement of the brightness temperature of the atmosphere. Required sensitivities range from 20 mK at 90 GHz to 1 K at 185 GHz for the MMA, and 120 mK for the VLA at 22 GHz. The minimum gain stability requirement is 200 at 185 GHz at the MMA assuming that the astronomical receivers are used for radiometry. This increases to 2000 for an uncooled system. The stability requirement is 450 for the cooled system at the VLA at 22 GHz. To perform absolute radiometric phase corrections also requires knowledge of the tropospheric parameters and models to an accuracy of a few percent. It may be possible to perform an `empirically calibrated' radiometric phase correction, in which the relationship between fluctuations in brightness temperature differences with fluctuations in interferometric phases is calibrated by observing a celestial calibrator at regular intervals.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9908262,astro-ph,"It is suggested that the inner energetic engine of Gamma ray burst (GRB) may be the result of the transition of normal hadron to quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in rapidly-rotating and spin-down newborn neutron star. When such a nascent neutron star slows down through dipole electromagnetic and quadruple gravitational radiation, the increasing center density may reach the QCD transition density, i.e., 5-10 nuclear density. Such kind of energy release from the phase transition would be responsible for GRB and its possible beaming effect. The relative dense gaseous environment of GRB location and the iron line observed in the X-ray afterglow support this idea.

First, we have constructed the Fundamental Plane for the 30 E and S0 galaxies and find that it has the following shape: re = sigma**(1.31-0.13) * <I>e**(-0.86-0.10), similar to that found locally. The 1-sigma intrinsic scatter about this plane is 14% in M/L(V), comparable to that observed in Coma. We conclude that these E and S0 galaxies are structurally mature and homogeneous, like those observed in nearby clusters. The M/L(V) ratios of these early-type galaxies are offset from the Coma Fundamental Plane by delta log M/L(V) = -0.13- 0.03 (q0=0.1), indicative of mild luminosity evolution. This evolution suggests a formation epoch for the stars of z > 1. We have also analyzed the M/L(V) ratios of galaxies of type S0/a and later. These early-type spirals follow a different plane from the E and S0 galaxies, with a scatter that is twice as large as the scatter for the E/S0s. The difference in the tilt between the plane of the spirals and the plane of the E/S0s is shown to be due to a systematic correlation of velocity dispersion with residual from the plane of the early-type galaxies. These residuals also correlate with the residuals from the Color-Magnitude relation. Thus for spirals in clusters, we see a systematic variation in the luminosity-weighted mean properties of the stellar populations with central velocity dispersion. If this is a relative age trend, then luminosity-weighted age is positively correlated with dispersion. [abridged version]",1999,[],5

For a two-dimensional galaxy catalog, however, we can measure the galaxy-galaxy angular correlation function which provides information on the density distribution of galaxies. By utilizing photometric redshifts, we can measure the angular correlation function in redshift shells (Brunner 1997, Connolly et al. 1998) which minimizes the galaxy projection effect, and allows for a measurement of the evolution in the correlation strength with redshift. In this proceedings, we present some preliminary results which extend our previous work using more accurate photometric redshifts, and also incorporate absolute magnitudes, so that we can measure the evolution of clustering with either redshift or intrinsic luminosity.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9903031,astro-ph,"We present basic laboratory infrared data on a large number of SiC particulate samples, which should be of great value for the interpretation of the 11.3 micron feature observed in the spectra of carbon-rich stars. The laboratory spectra show a wide variety of the SiC phonon features in the 10-13 micron wavelength range, both in peak wavelength and band shape. The main parameters determining the band profile are morphological factors as grain size and shape and, in many cases, impurities in the material. We discovered the interesting fact that free charge carriers, generated e.g. by nitrogen doping, are a very common characteristics of many SiC particle samples. These free charge carriers produce very strong plasmon absorption in the near and middle infrared, which may also heavily influence the 10-13 micron feature profile via plasmon-phonon coupling.   We also found that there is no systematic dependence of the band profile on the crystal type (alpha- vs. beta-SiC). This is proven both experimentally and by theoretical calculations based on a study of the SiC phonon frequencies. Further, we give optical constants of amorphous SiC. We discuss the implications of the new laboratory results for the interpretation of the spectra of carbon stars.",1999,[],5

In the inner region of the ROSAT field (15' radius) we detected 50 X-ray sources with Sx >= 3.7x10(-15) erg/cm2/s. When corrected for the different sensitivity over the field, the estimated observed surface density at Sx >= 4x10(-15) erg/cm2/s is 272/-40 sources/sq.deg. Four X-ray sources, corresponding to 8% of the total sample, have been detected in radio images with a flux limit of about 0.2 mJy. Careful statistical analysis of multicolour CCD data in the error boxes of the 50 X-ray sources has led to the identification of 42 sources, corresponding to 84% of the X-ray sample. These 42 reliable identifications are 33 AGNs (including two radio galaxies and one BL Lac candidate; 79% of the identified sources), 2 galaxies, 3 groups or clusters of galaxies and 4 stars. We also show that it is likely that a few of the 8 unidentified sources are such because the derived X-ray positions may be offset with respect to the real ones due to confusion effects. The unidentified sources have a large ratio of X-ray to optical fluxes and most of them have harder than average X-ray spectra. Since most of the identified objects with these characteristics in our field and in the Lockman field are AGNs, we conclude that also most of these sources are likely to be AGNs.

We have compared the ne for PSR J1744-1134 with those for another 11 nearby pulsars with independent distance estimates. We conclude that there is a striking asymmetry in the distribution of electrons in the local interstellar medium. The electron column densities for pulsars in the third Galactic quadrant are found to be systematically higher than for those in the first. The former correlate with the position of the well known local HI cavity in quadrant three.

astro-ph/9909443,astro-ph,"Newly emerging magnetic flux can show a complicated linked or interwoven topology of the magnetic field. The complexity of this linkage or knottedness of magnetic flux is related to the free energy stored in the magnetic field. Magnetic reconnection provides a process to release this energy on the time scale of the dynamics. At the same time it approximately conserves the total magnetic helicity. Therefore the conservation of total magnetic helicity is a crucial constraint for the relaxation of complex magnetic fields. However, the total magnetic helicity is only the first, most elementary, quantity of an infinite series of topological invariants of the magnetic field. All these invariants are strictly conserved in ideal magnetohydrodynamics. As an example a preliminary set of these invariants is derived.

We use three methods to compare the clustering properties: the counts-in-cells comparison of Efstathiou (1995), the two-point cross correlation function, and the Tegmark (1998) `null-buster' test. We find that the Stromlo variances are systematically higher than those of PSCz, as expected due to the deficit of early-type galaxies in IRAS samples. However we find that the differences between the cell counts are consistent with a linear bias between the two surveys, with a relative bias parameter brel = bStromlo/bPSCz \approx 1.3 which appears approximately scale-independent.

We explain why our results for the rise time have more solid physical justification than those obtained by other authors. It is shown that small variations in the chemical composition of the ejecta, produced in the explosions with different regimes of nuclear burning, can influence drastically the light curve decline in the B band and, to a lesser extent, in the V band.

Part of the matter - equation of the mass of the cloud (equation of the final gravitational energy of the cloud) - gets radial kinetic energy which is larger than its potential energy and can be thrown away to the infinity.

astro-ph/9902018,astro-ph,"We present results of a numerical integration of the hydrodynamical equations governing the self-similar, two-dimensional gas flow behind the bow shock of an FRII radio source embedded in an IGM with a power law density profile. The model predicts pressure gradients within the cocoons consistent with modest backflow. For very steep external density profiles sources may well not expand in a self-similar fashion and in this case the model is not self-consistent. The assumption of ram pressure confinement of the cocoons perpendicular to the jet axis is found to overestimate the ratio of the pressure in front of the radio hot spots and that in the cocoons. Based on the properties of the gas between bow shock and cocoon we calculate the X-ray surface brightness of the flow. This emission is found to be a good tracer of the density distribution within the flow and varies significantly with the properties of the unshocked IGM. The cooling-time of the shocked IGM is found to be comparable to, or greater than, the Hubble time. The influence of a radio source on the evolution of its gaseous surroundings therefore extends well beyond the limited life time of the source itself. We compare our results with the X-ray map of Cygnus A and find some evidence for cold, dense gas clumps in the surroundings of this object. The extended X-ray emission observed around 3C 356 may also be caused by the bow shock of this radio source.

astro-ph/9906108,astro-ph,"We discuss the technique of Wide-field imaging as it applies to Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). In the past VLBI data sets were usually averaged so severely that the field-of-view was typically restricted to regions extending a few hundred milliarcseconds from the phase centre of the field. Recent advances in data analysis techniques, together with increasing data storage capabilities, and enhanced computer processing power, now permit VLBI images to be made whose angular size represents a significant fraction of an individual antenna's primary beam. This technique has recently been successfully applied to several large separation gravitational lens systems, compact Supernova Remnants in the starburst galaxy M82, and two faint radio sources located within the same VLA FIRST field. It seems likely that other VLBI observing programmes might benefit from this wide-field approach to VLBI data analysis. With the raw sensitivity of global VLBI set to improve by a factor 4-5 over the coming few years, the number of sources that can be detected in a given field will rise considerably. In addition, a continued progression in VLBI's ability to image relatively faint and extended low brightness temperature features (such as hot-spots in large-scale astrophysical jets) is also to be expected.

astro-ph/9904330,astro-ph,"It is crucial to understand the extreme intermittency of ocean and lake turbulence and turbulent mixing in order to estimate vertical fluxes of momentum, heat and mass by Osborn-Cox flux-dissipation methods. Vast undersampling errors occur by this method when intermittency is not taken into account. Oceanic turbulence increases intermittency as the result of a self-similar nonlinear cascade covering a wide range of scales, mostly horizontal. Extremely large intermittency factors Ie and Ic measured for Galactic and oceanic turbulence are in the range 3-7. These values are consistent with the third universal similarity hypothesis for turbulence of Kolmogorov (1962) and a length scale range over 3-7 decades from viscous or diffusive to buoyancy or Coriolis force domination, where the measured universal intermittency constant mu = 0.44, Gibson (1991a), is a result of singularities in multifractal turbulence dissipation networks and their degeneration, Bershadskii and Gibson (1994).

astro-ph/9906368,astro-ph,"Here, using a sample of 88 galaxies, we examine the scatter about the Faber-Jackson (F-J) relation, and find that a galaxy's position relative to this relation depends on its age. We attempt to reproduce the observed trend of the F-J residuals with age using two simple models. The first assumes that galaxy age is tracing the last major star formation event in an elliptical galaxy. The fading of this burst changes the MB component of the F-J residuals, with time. Such a model was very successful at reproducing the B-V and Mg2 evolution reported in our previous paper, but is unable to reproduce the strength of the F-J trend. A second model is required to describe age-correlated changes in galaxy dynamics. Following expectations from cosmological simulations, we assume that the velocity dispersion, for a galaxy of a given mass, scales with the epoch of galaxy formation, i.e. with the mean density of the Universe. Hence recently formed ellipticals have systematically lower velocity dispersions than old ellipticals. We find that a combination of these two models provides a good match to the change in F-J residuals with galaxy age. This suggests that young ellipticals will have subtly different dynamical properties to old ellipticals. We also find that there is not a strong relationship between a galaxy's age and its luminosity for our sample.

Our final goal is to construct a reliable, robust and unbiased field of density contrasts over a wide range of physical scales. Exploring in detail the nature of the three dimensional galaxy distribution will provide us with invaluable qualitative cosmographical information about the topology and morphology of the local overdensities; but it also allows us to investigate on the z=0 cosmology, greatly increasing our quantitative understanding of physical parameters that constrain the evolution of structures and their clustering properties. Moreover, its near full-sky coverage and the large variety in galaxy content make the NOG ideal also for more specific tasks as the deconvolution of environmental effects from the properties and evolution history of the galaxies.",1999,[],5

They present extremely complex ensembles of filaments, knots, ansae, and shell multiplicity. It is then overwhelmingly complicated to derive reasonable evolutionary paths to justify the observed shapes of PNe. The confrontation between the evolution of the shells and that of the central stars is needed to understand the origin of the morphological variety. We present some background and recent results on the correlations between PN morphology and PN nuclei (PNNi) evolution, including a study on the Magellanic Cloud PNe.",1999,[],5

It seems that it is time to open up for discussion with UN and ESA organizations and also with IAU, how to implement links between robotic telescopes and such Universities applying for collaborations.

astro-ph/9909380,astro-ph,"Arecibo spectra of the mainline OH maser emission from U Her over more than a decade show variations of the OH emission over these time scales. These observations are combined with high spatial resolution VLBA maps to investigate the causes of the variations in the velocities of the maser components. Global properties of the dust shell, such as accelerations, variations in the pump and shell-wide magnetic field changes are examined as possibilities, and eliminated. A possible solution to the problem involving plasma turbulence and the local magnetic field is introduced, and the relevant time scales of the turbulence are calculated. The turbulent velocity field yields time scales of the turbulence are calculated. The turbulent velocity field yields time scales that are too long (of order centuries), while the turbulent magnetic field produces variations on appropriate time scales of a few years. A line-of-sight model of the turbulence is developed and investigated. The complete exploration of this solution requires extensive theoretical and observational work. Possible avenues of investigation of the plasma turbulence model are presented.",1999,[],5

We find that the fluence or energy distribution of bursts is consistent with a power law of index 1.66, over 4 orders of magnitude. This scale-free distribution resembles the Gutenberg-Richter Law for earthquakes, and gives evidence for self-organized criticality in SGRs. The distribution of time intervals between successive bursts from SGR 190014 is consistent with a log-normal distribution. There is no correlation between burst intensity and the waiting times till the next burst, but there is some evidence for a correlation between burst intensity and the time elapsed since the previous burst. We also find a correlation between the duration and the energy of the bursts, but with significant scatter. In all these statistical properties, SGR bursts resemble earthquakes and solar flares more closely than they resemble any known accretion-powered or nuclear-powered phenomena. Thus our analysis lends support to the hypothesis that the energy source for SGR bursts is internal to the neutron star, and plausibly magnetic.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9908144,astro-ph,"We have studied the stellar populations in a region of 30 pc around SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud using multi-band HST-WFPC2 images.   The effective temperature, luminosity and reddening of each detected star were determined by fitting the measured broad band magnitudes to the ones calculated with model atmospheres. The resulting HR diagram reveals the presence of stars with ages between 1 and 150 Myrs, superposed on a much older field population. The youngest stars in the field appear to be T Tauri stars, characterized by strong Halpha excesses.   The Star Formation Rate has increased monotonically in the last 8 Gyrs and the star formation activity is still very high at present.   Young stars of low and high mass have different spatial distributions. The latter ones are strongly concentrated in the vicinities of the Supernova, whereas the previous ones are more evenly distributed on the field. Hence, the Mass Function varies on a scale of a few parsecs. However, averaging over the entire area, one can define an Initial Mass Function, well fitted by a power-law with a slope alpha<-2.55. The uncertainty on the IMF due to incompleteness in identifying T Tauri stars is discussed.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9908292,astro-ph,"We have selected 42 elliptical galaxies from the literature and estimated their velocity dispersions at the effective radius (equation) and at 0.54 effective radii (equation).

Our sample analysis suggests that equation lies in the range 178-198 km sequation. The power law relation we find between the luminosity and the dark matter velocity dispersion measured in this way is equation, where equation is between 2-3. These results are of interest for strong gravitational lensing statistics studies.   In order to determine the value of equation, we calculate equation in the same equation band in which equation has been estimated.

astro-ph/9901059,astro-ph,"We present a new analysis of the far-IR emission at high Galactic latitude based on COBE and HI data. A decomposition of the Far-IR emission over the HI, H and H2 Galactic gas components and the Cosmic Far InfraRed Background (CFIRB) is described.   For the first time the far-IR emission of dust associated with the Warm Ionised Medium (WIM) is evidenced. This component determined on about 25% of the sky is detected at a 10 sigma level in the [200, 350]micron band. The best representation of the WIM dust spectrum is obtained for a temperature of 29.1 K and an emissivity law equation. With a spectral index equal to 2, the emissivity law becomes equation, with a temperature of 20 K, which is significantly higher than the temperature of dust associated with HI gas. The variation in the dust spectrum from the HI to the WIM component can be explained by only changing the upper cutoff of the Big Grain size distribution from 0.1 micron to 30 nm. The detection of IR emission of dust in the WIM significantly decreases the intensity of the CFIRB, especially around 200 micron which corresponds to the peak of energy.",1999,[],5

Low-mass (~ 105-6 Msun) seed black holes are assumed to have been formed earlier. The most massive black holes giving rise to the most luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN) in active phases are expected to grow in violent mergers of large disk-plus-bulge systems that lead to giant elliptical galaxies, the typical hosts of radio galaxies and quasars. We consider current ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRG) as systems closely resembling the predecessors of early formed massive ellipticals.

The properties of these clusters are briefly reviewed, and the impact of galaxy environment on the evolution and survival of star clusters is discussed. Several (but not all) Local Group galaxies seem to share a common epoch of the earliest globular cluster formation. The most massive galaxies show a tendency for rapid enrichment in their oldest cluster population near their centers as compared to clusters at larger galactocentric radii. The galactocentric dependence of cluster sizes and horizontal branch morphology may be intrinsic to the globular cluster formation process rather than to the accretion of dwarf galaxies. The observed properties of globular clusters in the least massive dwarfs suggest that their parent galaxies may originally have been substantially more massive. Cluster destruction mechanisms and time scales are a function of galaxy environment and galaxy mass. The most recent enhancement of star cluster formation in the Magellanic Clouds may have been triggered by their close encounter with each other and the Milky Way.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9909102,astro-ph,"V,R,I continuum bands and Halpha  [NII] photometry for circumnuclear star forming regions (CNSFR) is presented, for galaxies with different kinds of nuclear activity: NGC 7469 (Sy 1), NGC 1068 (Sy 2), NGC 7177 (LINER) and NGC 3310 (Starburst). Their Halpha luminosities (0.02 - 7x10**40 erg/s; uncorrected for internal extinction), are comparable to those observed in other galaxies. No systematic differences in the broad band colours are found for the CNSFR in the different galaxies, except for those in NGC 3310 which are considerably bluer, partially due to a younger stellar population. Using theoretical evolutionary synthesis models some colours can be reproduced by single populations (between 7 and 300 Myr) and extinction 0.5-1.5 mag). However, in many cases, the observed equivalent width of Halpha, require a younger population. NGC 1068, 7177 and 7469, are fitted by a two-burst population model at solar metallicity; the age difference between both populations is around 5-7 Myr and the younger burst involves 3 - 61% of the total mass of the cluster,consistent with the younger burst being originated by supernova activity from the previous one. NGC 3310, requires younger ionizing population ages and lower metallicity. An excess (R-I) observed/predicted, not consistent with a normal reddening law can be atributted to red supergiants present in the older population, and not properly accounted for by the models. The two-population scenario seems to show a trend of the evolutionary state of the CNSFR with the nuclear type of the parent galaxy that remains to be explored.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9905095,astro-ph,"We present the observed relation between the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature decrement due to the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect and the X-ray luminosity of galaxy clusters. We discuss this relation in terms of the cluster properties, and show that the slope of the observed relation is in agreement with both the L-T relation based on numerical simulations and X-ray emission observations, and the Mgas-L relation based on observations. The slope of the Delta TSZ-L relation is also consistent with the Mtot-L relation, where Mtot is the cluster total mass based on gravitational lensing observations. This agreement may be taken to imply a constant gas mass fraction within galaxy clusters, however, there are large uncertainties, dominated by observational errors, associated with these relations. Using the Delta TSZ-L relation and the cluster X-ray luminosity function, we evaluate the local cluster contribution to arcminute scale cosmic microwave background anisotropies.

astro-ph/9912478,astro-ph,"We investigate the effects of heating generated by damping of Alfven waves on protostellar accretion disks. Two mechanisms of damping are investigated, nonlinear and turbulent, which were previously studied in stellar winds (Jatenco-Pereira & Opher 1989a, b). For the nominal values studied, f=delta v/vA=0.002 and F=varpi/Omegai=0.1, where delta v, vA and varpi are the amplitude, velocity and average frequency of the Alfven wave, respectively, and Omegai is the ion cyclotron frequency, we find that viscous heating is more important than Alfven heating for small radii. When the radius is greater than 0.5 AU, Alfvenic heating is more important than viscous heating. Thus, even for the relatively small value of f=0.002, Alfvenic heating can be an important source of energy for ionizing protostellar disks, enabling angular momentum transport to occur by the Balbus-Hawley instability.",1999,[],5

A model-dependent extrapolation of this value indicates that the total radiated energy may be as high as equation erg. The high value of the radiated energy supports a scenario in which most of the kinetic energy of the ejecta is thermalized and radiated in a short interaction with a dense circumstellar medium of nearly constant density.

astro-ph/9903172,astro-ph,"We present a new algorithm, called Multiresolution Regularized Expectation Maximization (MREM), for the reconstruction of gamma-ray intensity maps from COMPTEL data. The algorithm is based on the iterative Richardson-Lucy scheme to which we added a wavelet thresholding step in order to eliminate image-noise in the reconstruction. The wavelet thresholding explicitly accounts for spatial correlations in the data, and adapts the angular resolution locally, depending on the significance of the signal in the data.   We compare the performance of MREM to that of the maximum entropy and the Richardson-Lucy algorithms by means of Monte-Carlo simulations of COMPTEL 1.809 MeV gamma-ray line observations. The simulations demonstrate that the maximum entropy and Richardson-Lucy algorithms provide virtually identical reconstructions which are heavily disturbed by image noise. MREM largely suppresses this noise in the reconstructions, showing only the significant structures that are present in the data.   Application of MREM to COMPTEL 1.8 MeV gamma-ray line data results in a 1.809 MeV sky map that is much smoother than the maximum entropy or Richardson-Lucy reconstructions presented previously. The essential features of this map are (1) an asymmetric galactic ridge emission reaching from l=45 deg to l=240 deg,   (2) a bright localised emission feature in the Cygnus region around (l,b)=(80 deg,0 deg),   (3) two emission spots at l=317 deg and l=332 deg situated in the galactic plane, and (4) an extended emission region around (l,b)=(160 deg, 0 deg).

Most of them have been followed-up with the Narrow Field Instruments aboard the same satellite. In the light of these results we discuss open issues on the GRB phenomenon. We find that the optically thin synchrotron shock model (SSM) provides an acceptable representation of most of the time-resolved GRB spectra extending down to 2 keV, except in the initial phases of several bursts and during the whole duration of the quite strong GRB970111, where a low-energy photon depletion with respect to the thin SSM spectrum is observed. We find that the X-ray afterglow starts at about 50% of the GRB duration, and that its fluence, as computed from the WFC light curve, is consistent with the decay law found from the afterglow NFI observations. We also investigate the hydrodynamical evolution of the GRB in our sample and their associated afterglow, when it was detected.

astro-ph/9911336,astro-ph,"Density fluctuations in the matter distribution lead to distortions of the images of distant galaxies through weak gravitational lensing effects. This provides an efficient probe of the cosmological parameters and of the density field. In this article, we investigate the statistical properties of the convergence due to weak gravitational lensing by non-linear structures (i.e. we consider small angular windows equation). Previous studies have shown how to relate the second and third order moments of the convergence to those of the density contrast while models based on the Press-Schechter prescription provide an estimate of the tail of equation. Here we present a method to obtain an estimate of the full p.d.f. of the convergence equation. It is based on a realistic description of the density field which applies to overdense as well as underdense regions. We show that our predictions agree very well with the results of N-body simulations for the convergence. This could allow one to derive the cosmological parameters equation as well as the full p.d.f. equation of the density contrast itself in the non-linear regime from observations. Hence this gives a very powerfull tool to constrain scenarios of structure formation.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9904003,astro-ph,"We present a new shear estimator for weak lensing observations which properly accounts for the effects of a realistic point spread function (PSF). Images of faint galaxies are subject to gravitational shearing followed by smearing with the instrumental and/or atmospheric PSF. We construct a `finite resolution shear operator' which when applied to an observed image has the same effect as a gravitational shear applied prior to smearing. This operator allows one to calibrate essentially any shear estimator. We then specialize to the case of weighted second moment shear estimators. We compute the shear polarizability which gives the response of an individual galaxy's polarization to a gravitational shear. We then compute the response of the population of galaxies, and thereby construct an optimal weighting scheme for combining shear estimates from galaxies of various shapes, luminosities and sizes. We define a figure of merit --- an inverse shear variance per unit solid angle --- which characterizes the quality of image data for shear measurement. The new method is tested with simulated image data. We discuss the correction for anisotropy of the PSF and propose a new technique involving measuring shapes from images which have been convolved with a re-circularizing PSF. We draw attention to a hitherto ignored noise related bias and show how this can be analyzed and corrected for. The analysis here draws heavily on the properties of real PSF's and we include as an appendix a brief review, highlighting those aspects which are relevant for weak lensing.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9901096,astro-ph,"We study the equilibrium of pressure truncated, filamentary molecular clouds that are threaded by rather general helical magnetic fields. We first derive a new virial equation appropriate for magnetized filamentary clouds, which includes the effects of non-thermal motions and the turbulent pressure of the surrounding ISM. When compared with the data, we find that many filamentary clouds have a mass per unit length that is significantly reduced by the effects of external pressure, and that toroidal fields play a significant role in squeezing such clouds.   We also develop exact numerical MHD models of filamentary molecular clouds with more general helical field configurations than have previously been considered. We also examine the effects of the equation of state by comparing 'isothermal' filaments, with constant total (thermal plus turbulent) velocity dispersion, with equilibria constructed using a logatropic equation of state.   We perform a Monte Carlo exploration of our parameter space to determine which choices of parameters result in models that agree with the available observational constraints. We find that both equations of state result in equilibria that agree with the observational results. Moreover, we find that models with helical fields have more realistic density profiles than either unmagnetized models or those with purely poloidal fields; we find that most isothermal models have density distributions that fall off as r-1.8 to r-2, while logatropes have density profiles that range from r-1 to r-1.8. We find that purely poloidal fields produce filaments with steep density gradients that not allowed by the observations.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9904386,astro-ph,"We have investigated the effect of pressure from intracluster medium (ICM) on disk galaxies in merging clusters. The ram-pressure on the galaxies rapidly increases when two clusters collide. This leads to stripping of the interstellar medium (ISM) and decrease of star formation rate (SFR) of the galaxies. On the other hand, the increase of SFR caused by compression of ISM is less significant. Thus, cluster merger does not trigger, but weakens star formation activity of the galaxies. In the central region of the colliding clusters, blue galaxies with high velocity should exist, although most of galaxies become red. Following the decrease of blue galaxy fraction in the clusters, the fraction of post-starburst galaxies increases. After merger, many galaxies in the cluster restart star formation activity and the segregation of blue and red galaxies becomes prominent.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9905294,astro-ph,"Spectropolarimetry from the near IR to the far UV of light scattered by dust provides a valuable diagnostic of the dust composition, grain size distribution and spatial distribution. To facilitate the use of this diagnostic, we present detailed calculations of the intensity and polarization spectral signature of light scattered by optically thin and optically thick dust in various geometries. The polarized light radiative transfer calculations are carried out using the adding-doubling method for a plane-parallel slab, and are extended to an optically thick sphere by integrating over its surface. The calculations are for the Mathis, Rumple & Nordsieck Galactic dust model, and cover the range from 1 equation to 500 \AA. We find that the wavelength dependence of the scattered light intensity provides a sensitive probe of the optical depth of the scattering medium, while the polarization wavelength dependence provides a probe of the grain scattering properties, which is practically independent of optical depth. We provide a detailed set of predictions, including polarization maps, which can be used to probe the properties of dust through imaging spectropolarimetry in the near IR to far UV of various Galactic and extragalactic objects. In a following paper we use the codes developed here to provide predictions for the dependence of the intensity and polarization on grain size distribution and composition.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9903185,astro-ph,"In this review, I discuss just three aspects of the stability and evolution of galactic discs. (1) I first review our understanding of the bar instability and how it can be controlled. Disc galaxies in which the orbital speed does not decrease much towards the centre have no difficulty avoiding bars, even when dark matter makes an insignificant contribution to the inner part of the rotation curve. (2) I then briefly discuss interactions between disturbances in the discs of galaxies and the spherical components, which generally exert a damping effect through dynamical friction. The fact that bars in real galaxies appear to rotate quite rapidly, seems to require dark matter halos to have large, low-density cores. (3) In the remainder of the article, I consider the theory of spiral structure. The new development here is that the distribution function for stars in the Solar neighbourhood, as measured by HIPPARCOS, is far less smooth than most theoretical work had previously supposed. The strong variations in the values of the \DF over small ranges in angular momentum have the appearance of having been caused by scattering at Lindblad resonances with spiral patterns. This result, if confirmed when the radial velocity data become available, supports the picture of spiral patterns as dynamical instabilities driven by substructure in the \DF. The details of how decaying patterns might seed conditions for a new instability remain unclear, and deserve fresh attention.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9906068,astro-ph,"Far-ultraviolet radiation is a ubiquitous, if unanticipated, phenomenon in elliptical galaxies and early-type spiral bulges. It is the most variable photometric feature associated with old stellar populations. Recent observational and theoretical evidence shows that it is produced mainly by low-mass, small-envelope, helium-burning stars in extreme horizontal branch and subsequent phases of evolution. These are probably descendents of the dominant, metal rich population of the galaxies. Their lifetime UV outputs are remarkably sensitive to their physical properties and hence to the age and the helium and metal abundances of their parents. UV spectra are therefore exceptionally promising diagnostics of old stellar populations, although their calibration requires a much improved understanding of giant branch mass loss, helium enrichment, and atmospheric diffusion.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9904428,astro-ph,"(Abridged) We investigate the interplay between starbursts and host galaxies by studying the structure and physical characteristics of the ionized gas surrounding the central starbursts in the two nearby galaxies NGC5253 and NGC5236. The two systems represent very different galactic environments, NGC5253 being a metal-poor dwarf, and NGC5236 being a metal-rich, massive spiral. We present images of the starburst regions in these two galaxies in the line emission [OIII], H-alpha, and [SII], and in continuum U, V, R. For NGC5253, line ratio maps [OIII]/H-beta and [SII]/H-alpha show that in the outer regions the diffuse ionized gas (DIG) is partially excited by a non-photoionization process (`shocks'). The `shocked' gas is mostly concentrated south-west of the galaxy's center, in coincidence with the position of H-alpha bubbles and with extended soft X-ray emission. The H-alpha emission from the shock-excited gas is ~1-2% of the total. About 80-90% of the DIG is consistent with being photoionized, requiring that about 10% of the ionizing photons escape from the starburst site. The starburst in NGC5253 appears to be fed by gas infalling along the galaxy's optical minor axis, while hot gas expanding from the starburst has a preferential direction along the major axis. The results for NGC5236 are less clear than for NGC5253, as the images are not as deep. The emission line ratio maps show very little or no evidence for presence of shock excitation and very little or no ionized gas appears expanding from the center of the galaxy outward along the disk plane. The starburst in NGC5236 is thus more strongly confined than that in NGC5253, probably due to the deeper gravitational potential well of the more massive galaxy.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9903178,astro-ph,"A great deal of interest has been generated recently by the results of deep submillimetre surveys, which in principle allow an unobscured view of dust-enshrouded star formation at high redshift. The extragalactic far-infrared and submillimetre backgrounds have also been detected, providing further constraints on the history of star formation. In this paper we estimate the fraction of these backgrounds and source counts which could be explained by AGN. The relative fractions of obscured and unobscured objects are constrained by the requirement that they fit the spectrum of the cosmic X-ray background. On the assumption that the spectral energy distributions of high redshift AGN are similar to those observed locally, we find that one can explain at least 10-20 per cent of the 850 micron SCUBA sources at 1mJy and a similar fraction of the far-infrared/submillimetre background. The exact contribution depends on the assumed cosmology and the space density of AGN at high redshift (z>3), but we conclude that active nuclei will be present in a significant (though not dominant) fraction of the faint SCUBA sources. This fraction could be significantly higher if a large population of AGN are highly obscured (Compton-thick) at X-ray wavelengths.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9907338,astro-ph,"All of the proposed explanations for the microlensing events observed towards the LMC have difficulties. One of these proposed explanations, LMC self-lensing, which invokes ordinary LMC stars as the long sought-after lenses, has recently gained considerable popularity as a possible solution to the microlensing conundrum. In this paper, we carefully examine the set of LMC self-lensing models. In particular, we review the pertinent observations made of the LMC, and show how these observations place limits on such self-lensing models. We find that, given current observational constraints, no purely LMC disk models are capable of producing optical depths as large as that reported in the MACHO collaboration 2-year analysis. Besides pure disk, we also consider alternate geometries, and present a framework which encompasses the previous studies of LMC self-lensing. We discuss which model parameters need to be pushed in order for such models to succeed. For example, like previous workers, we find that an LMC halo geometry may be able to explain the observed events. However, since all known LMC tracer stellar populations exhibit disk-like kinematics, such models will have difficulty being reconciled with observations. For SMC self-lensing, we find predicted optical depths differing from previous results, but more than sufficient to explain all observed SMC microlensing. In contrast, for the LMC we find a self-lensing optical depth contribution between 0.47e-8 and 7.84e-8, with 2.44e-8 being the value for the set of LMC parameters most consistent with current observations.",1999,[],5

The distribution of the extinction in the clouds leads to estimate their total individual masses M and their maximum of extinction. I show that the relation between the mass contained within an iso-extinction contour and the extinction is similar from cloud to cloud and allows the extrapolation of the maximum of extinction in the range 5.7 to 25.5 magnitudes. I found that about half of the mass is contained in regions where the visual extinction is smaller than 1 magnitude. The star count method used on large scale (about 250 square degrees) is a powerful and relatively straightforward method to estimate the mass of molecular complexes.

astro-ph/9912226,astro-ph,"A grid of synthetic horizontal-branch (SHB) models based on HB evolutionary tracks with improved physics has been constructed to reconsider the theoretical calibration of the dependence of Mv(RR) on metallicity in globular clusters, and the slope of the mean <Mv(RR)>-[Fe/H] relation. The SHB models confirm Lee's earlier finding (Lee 1991) that the slope of the <Mv(RR)>-[Fe/H] relation is itself a function of the metallicity range considered, and that in addition, for a given [Fe/H], RR Lyrae luminosities depend on HB morphology. This is due to the fact that HB stars pass through the RR Lyrae instability strip at different evolutionary stages, depending on their original position on the HB. At [Fe/H]=-1.9, and for HB type 0, the models yield Mv(RR)=0.47  0.10. The mean slope for the zero-age HB models is 0.204. Since there is no simple universal relation between Mv(RR) and metallicity that is applicable to all globular clusters, the HB morphology of each individual cluster must be taken into account, in addition to [Fe/H], in deriving the appropriate Mv(RR). Taking HB morphology into account, we find that the slope of the mean <Mv(RR)>-[Fe/H] relation varies between 0.36 for the clusters with galactocentric distances Rgc less than 6 kpc and 0.22 for clusters with 6<Rgc<20 kpc. Implications for interpreting observations of field RR Lyrae variables and for absolute globular cluster ages and galactic chronology are briefly discussed.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9906197,astro-ph,"A simple model for the Milky Way halo is presented. It has a flat rotation curve in the inner regions, but the density falls off sharply beyond an outer edge. This truncated, flat rotation curve (TF) model possesses a rich family of simple distribution functions which vary in velocity anisotropy. The model is used to estimate the total mass of the Milky Way halo using the latest data on the motions of satellite galaxies and globular clusters at Galactocentric radii greater than 20 kpc. This comprises a dataset of 27 objects with known distances and radial velocities, of which 6 also possess measured proper motions. Unlike earlier investigations, we find entirely consistent maximum likelihood solutions unaffected by the presence or absence of Leo I, provided both radial and proper motion data are used. The availability of the proper motion data for the satellites is crucial as, without them, the mass estimates with and without Leo I are inconsistent at the 99 % confidence level. All these results are derived from models in which the velocity normalisation of the halo potential is taken as 220 km/s. A detailed analysis of the uncertainties in our estimate is presented, including the effects of the small dataset, possible incompleteness or correlations in the satellite galaxy sample and the measurement errors. The most serious uncertainties come from the size of the dataset, which may cause a systematic underestimate by a factor of two, and the measurement errors, which cause a scatter in the mass of the order of a factor of two. We conclude that the total mass of the halo is 1.9 x 1012 solar masses, while the mass within 50 kpc is 5.4 x 1011 solar masses.

The sample selection was based on morphology, brightness, and optical diameters of galaxies within one Abell radius (1.2 degrees). The HI detected, yet deficient galaxies show a strong correlation in their HI properties with projected distance from the cluster center. The most strongly HI deficient (HI Def > 0.4) galaxies are located inside a radius of 30 arcmin (aprox 0.6 Mpc) from the center of Coma, roughly the extent of the central X-ray emission. These central galaxies show clear asymmetries in their HI distribution and/or shifts between the optical and 21cm positions. Seven so called blue disk galaxies in Coma were observed in HI and six were detected. We did a more sensitive search for HI from 11 of the 15 known post starburst galaxies in Coma. None were detected with typical HI mass limits between 3 and 7x107 solar masses. Our results present and enhance a picture already familiar for well studied clusters. HI poor galaxies are concentrated toward the center of the cluster. The HI morphology of the central galaxies, with optical disks extending beyond the HI disks is unique to cluster environments and strongly suggests an interaction with the IGM. A new result in Coma is the clumpy distribution of gas deficiency. In the cluster center the deficient galaxies are to the east while the non-detections are to the west. In the outer parts the gas rich galaxies are north of Coma, non-detected spirals are found in the NGC 4944 group to the east and NGC 4839 group to the SW.

Both phases of gas are present in similar column density ratios in each of the 5 velocity components, making it appear that this LLS is constructed of 5 very similar building blocks. We find that this system displays some of the properties expected of a hierarchical merging event, although published models may have trouble explaining the SiIV absorption we observe.

astro-ph/9911344,astro-ph,"We propose a simple explanation for the apparent dearth of radio pulsars associated with young supernova remnants (SNRs). Recent X-ray observations of young remnants have revealed slowly rotating (P ~ 10-s) central pulsars with pulsed emission above 2 keV, lacking in detectable radio emission. Some of these objects apparently have enormous magnetic fields, evolving in a manner distinct from the Crab pulsar. We argue that these X-ray pulsars can account for a substantial fraction of the long sought after neutron stars in SNRs and that Crab-like pulsars are perhaps the rarer, but more highly visible example of these stellar embers. Magnetic field decay likely accounts for their high X-ray luminosity, which cannot be explained as rotational energy loss, as for the Crab-like pulsars. We suggest that the natal magnetic field strength of these objects control their subsequent evolution. There are currently almost a dozen slow X-ray pulsars associated with young SNRs. Remarkably, these objects, taken together, represent at least half of the confirmed pulsars in supernova remnants. This being the case, these pulsars must be the progenitors of a vast population of previously unrecognized neutron stars.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9909411,astro-ph,"The compact, nonthermal radio source Sgr A* at the Galactic Center appears to be coincident with a 2.6 million solar mass point-like object. Its energy source may be the release of gravitational energy as gas from the interstellar medium descends into its potential well. Simple attempts at calculating the spectrum and flux based on this picture have come close to the observations, yet have had difficulty in accounting for the low efficiency in this source. There now appear to be two reasons for this low conversion rate: (1) the plasma separates into two temperatures, with the protons attaining a significantly higher temperature than that of the radiating electrons, and (2) the magnetic field, B, is sub-equipartition, which reduces the magnetic bremsstrahlung emissivity, and therefore the overall power of Sgr A*. We investigate the latter with improvement over what has been attempted before: rather than calculating B based on a presumed model, we instead infer its distribution with radius empirically with the requirement that the resulting spectrum matches the observations. Our ansatz for B(r) is motivated in part by earlier calculations of the expected magnetic dissipation rate due to reconnection in a compressed flow. We find reasonable agreement with the observed spectrum of Sgr A* as long as its distribution consists of 3 primary components: an outer equipartition field, a roughly constant field at intermediate radii (~1000 Schwarzschild radii), and an inner dynamo (more or less within the last stable orbit for a non-rotating black hole) which increases B to about 100 Gauss. The latter component accounts for the observed sub-millimiter hump in this source.",1999,[],5

To determine the lens mass with sufficient accuracy, the light curve near the caustic crossing should be observed within uncertainty of equation 1%.

astro-ph/9902365,astro-ph,"The asymptotic structure of outflows from rotating magnetized objects confined by a uniform external pressure is calculated. The flow is assumed to be perfect MHD, polytropic, axisymmetric and stationary. The well known associated first integrals together with the confining external pressure, which is taken to be independent of the distance to the source, determine the asymptotic structure. The integrals are provided by solving the flow physics for the base within the framework of the model developed in Paper I (Lery et al. 1998), which assumes conical geometry below the fast mode surface, and ensures the Alfv\'en regularity condition. Far from the source, the outflow collimate cylindrically. Slow (i.e. with small rotation parameter equation) rigid rotators give rise to diffuse electric current distribution in the asymptotic region. They are dominated by gas pressure. Fast rigid rotators have a core-envelope structure in which a current carrying core is surrounded by an essentially current free region where the azimuthal magnetic field dominates.

astro-ph/9904156,astro-ph,"Hierarchical theories of structure formation predict that clusters of galaxies should be embedded in a web like structure, with filaments emanating from them to large distances. The amount of mass contained within such filaments near a cluster can be comparable to the collapsed mass of the cluster itself. Diffuse infalling material also contains a large amount of mass. Both these components can contribute to the cluster weak lensing signal. This 'projection bias' is maximized if a filament lies close to the line-of-sight to a cluster. Using large--scale numerical simulations of structure formation in a cosmological constant dominated cold dark matter model, we show that the projected mass typically exceeds the actual mass by several tens of percent. This effect is significant for attempts to estimate cluster masses through weak lensing observations, and will affect weak lensing surveys aimed at constructing the cluster mass function.",1999,[],5

We measured the X-ray spectrum from 0.1 up to 100 keV. In both occasions the spectrum had a concave shape, with a break detected at about 4 and 2.5 keV, respectively. We interpret the steeper component at energies below the break as due to synchrotron emission and the extremely flat component at energies above the break as due to inverse Compton emission. This is so far the best example in which both the synchrotron and the Inverse Compton component are detected simultaneously and with the same instruments in the X-ray spectrum of a blazar. We detect a decrease of the X-ray flux of about 30% below the break between the first and the second observation, and smaller variability amplitude between 4 and 10 keV. During the May observation we also detected a fast variability event with the flux below 4 keV increasing by about a factor of three in 5 hours. Above 4 keV no variability was detected. We discuss these results in the framework of synchrotron self-Compton models.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9908273,astro-ph,"Beaming of relativistic ejecta in GRBs has been postulated by many authors in order to reduce the total GRB energy, thus it is very important to look for the observational evidence of beaming. Rhoads (1999) has pointed out that the dynamics of the blast wave, which is formed when the beamed ejecta sweeping the external medium, will be significantly modified by the sideways expansion due to the increased swept up matter. He claimed that shortly after the bulk Lorentz factor (equation) of the blast wave drops below the inverse of the initial opening angle (equation) of the beamed ejecta, there will be a sharp break in the afterglow light curves. However, some other authors have performed numerical calculations and shown that the break of the light curve is weaker and much smoother than the one analytically predicted. In this paper we reanalyse the dynamical evolution of the jet blast wave, calculate the jet emission analytically, we find that the sharp break predicted by Rhoads will actually not exist, and for most cases the afterglow light curve will almost not be affected by sideways expansion unless the beaming angle is extremely small. We demonstrate that only when equation, the afterglow light curves may be steepened by sideways expansion, and in fact there cannot be two breaks as claimed before. We have also constructed a simple numerical code to verify our conclusion.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9901092,astro-ph,"We used archival ROSAT observations to investigate the X-ray surface brightness profiles of a sample of 26 clusters in the redshift range (0.04-0.06). For 15 of these clusters accurate temperature (kT>3.5 keV) were available from the literature. The scaled emission measure profiles look remarkably similar above ~0.2 times the virial radius rV. On the other hand a large scatter is observed in the cluster core properties. We fitted a lettermodel (with and without excising the central part) to all the ROSAT profile to quantify the structural variations in the cluster population, unraveling a robust quadratic correlation between the core radius rc and the slope parameter beta. We quantified the shape of each gas density profile by the variation with radius of the logarithmic slope, \alphan. The bi-weight dispersion of \alphan among the clusters is less than 20% for any given scaled radii above x=0.2. There is a clear minimum spread at x=0.3, which is related to the existence of a correlation between rc and letter. These ensemble properties are insensitive to the exact treatment of a possible central excess when fitting the profiles. On the other hand the scatter is decreased when the radii are scaled to rV.   The regularity we found in the gas profiles at x>0.2 supports the existence of an universal underlying dark matter profile. It suggests that non gravitational heating is negligible for clusters with temperature above ~3.5keV. The very large scatter observed in the core properties favor scenario where Cooling Flows are periodically erased by merger events. Our results are consistent with the classical scaling M-T relation. Accordingly the spread in the reduced mass profiles derived from the hydrostatic isothermal betamodel is small.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9909473,astro-ph,"It has been proposed that some hot molecular cores (HMCs) harbor a young embedded massive star, which heats an infalling envelope and accretes mass at a rate high enough to 'choke off' an incipient HII region. This class of HMCs would mark the youngest phase known of massive star formation. In order to test this hypothesis, we model this type of object calculating the radiative transfer through a spherically symmetric dusty envelope infalling onto a central OB star, with accretion rates from 0.0006 to 0.001 solar masses per year. The dust thermal spectrum from infrared to radio wavelengths is derived and is compared with the observed fluxes of several hot cores which may be internally heated. We find that the data are best fitted using an envelope with the density distribution resulting from the collapse of a singular logatropic sphere, instead of that of a singular isothermal sphere. We conclude that several of these sources may be undergoing an intense accretion phase and find in all the cases that the accretion luminosity exceeds the stellar luminosity. We discuss the implications of this phase on the formation of massive stars.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9907128,astro-ph,"We have discovered a third quasar absorption system which is consistent with a low deuterium to hydrogen abundance ratio, D/H = 3.4 times 10-5. The z ~ 2.8 partial Lyman limit system towards QSO 0130-4021 provides the strongest evidence to date against large D/H ratios because the H I absorption, which consists of a single high column density component with unsaturated high order Lyman series lines, is readily modeled -- a task which is more complex in other D/H systems. We have obtained twenty-two hours of spectra from the HIRES spectrograph on the W.M. Keck telescope, which allow a detailed description of the Hydrogen. We see excess absorption on the blue wing of the H I Lyman alpha line, near the expected position of Deuterium. However, we find that Deuterium cannot explain all of the excess absorption, and hence there must be contamination by additional absorption, probably H I. This extra H I can account for most or all of the absorption at the D position, and hence D/H = 0 is allowed. We find an upper limit of D/H < 6.7 times 10-5 in this system, consistent with the value of D/H ~ 3.4 times 10-5 deduced towards QSO 10092956 and QSO 1937-1009 by Burles and Tytler (1998a, 1998b). This absorption system shows only weak metal line absorption, and we estimate [Si/H] < -2.6 -- indicating that the D/H ratio of the system is likely primordial. All four of the known high redshift absorption line systems simple enough to provide useful limits on D are consistent with D/H = 3.4 /- 0.25 times 10-5. Conversely, this QSO provides the third case which is inconsistent with much larger values.",1999,[],5

If the universe contains a cosmological constant, and if black holes can absorb energy from the vacuum, then black hole evaporation could be greatly suppressed. For the magnitude of the cosmological constant suggested by current observations, black holes larger than equation g would accrete energy rather than evaporate.

astro-ph/9911088,astro-ph,"We present spectroscopy of the dwarf nova IP Pegasi taken during two consecutive nights, 5 and 6 days after the start of an outburst. Even this late in the outburst, Doppler maps show marked spiral structure in the accretion disc, at least as strongly as seen earlier in other outbursts of IP Peg. The spiral shocks are present on both nights with no diminution in strength from one night to the next. The light curves of the lines show an offset to earlier phases, with the mid-eclipse of the emission lines displaced to phases between -0.015 - 0.001 and -0.045 - 0.009. This cannot be explained by the presence of the accretion shocks. As well as the fixed spiral pattern, the disc shows strong flaring in the Balmer and HeII lines. Irradiation-induced emission is seen from the companion star in the Balmer, HeI, HeII, MgII, CII, and other lines. The emission is located near the poles of the companion star, suggesting that the accretion disc shields the companion star substantially and thus has an effective H/R of order 0.2 at EUV wavelengths. The Balmer emission is distinctly broader than the other lines consistent with non-Doppler broadening.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9907348,astro-ph,"There are lines of evidence suggesting that some of the observed microlensing events in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) are caused by ordinary star lenses as opposed to dark Machos in the Galactic halo. Efficient lensing by ordinary stars generally requires the presence of one or more additional concentrations of stars along the line of sight to the LMC disk. If such a population behind the LMC disk exists, then the source stars (for lensing by LMC disk objects) will be drawn preferentially from the background population and will show systematic differences from LMC field stars. One such difference is that the (lensed) source stars will be farther away than the average LMC field stars, and this should be reflected in their apparent baseline magnitudes. We focus on red clump stars: these should appear in the color-magnitude diagram at a few tenths of a magnitude fainter than the field red clump. Suggestively, one of the two near-clump confirmed events, MACHO-LMC-1, is a few tenths of magnitude fainter than the clump.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9910073,astro-ph,"We study the optical properties of a large sample of galaxies in low-density regions of the nearby universe. We make a 5/h Mpc-smoothed map of the galaxy density throughout the Center for Astrophysics Redshift Survey (CfA2) to identify galaxies within three prominent nearby 'voids' with diameter >30/h Mpc. We augment the CfA2 void galaxy sample with fainter galaxies found in the same regions from the deeper Century and 15R Redshift Surveys. We obtain B and R CCD images and high-S/N longslit spectra for the resulting sample of 149 void galaxies, and also for 131 galaxies on the periphery of these voids.   Here we describe the photometry for the sample, including B isophotal magnitudes and B-R colors. For the 149 galaxies which lie in regions below the mean survey density, the luminosity functions in B and R are well-fit by Schechter functions with respective parameters (alphaB = -0.5 /- 0.3, B* = -18.9 /- 0.2) and (alphaR = -0.9 /- 0.3, R* = -20.4 /- 0.3). The B luminosity function (LF) is consistent with typical survey LFs (e.g., the Southern Sky Redshift Survey), and the R LF is consistent with the Century Survey. The B and R LFs of 131 galaxies in the 'void periphery', regions between the mean density and twice the mean, have similar Schechter parameters. The CfA2 LF is inconsistent with both samples at 3.5-sigma.   When we narrow our analysis to the 46 galaxies in regions below half the mean density, the LF is steeper: alpha = -1.4 /- 0.5. The typical survey LFs are inconsistent with this subsample at 2-sigma. The B-R color distribution of galaxies in the lowest-density regions is also shifted significantly (3-sigma) blue-ward of the higher density samples.

The burst is unremarkable in gamma rays, but in optical is the first one to show good evidence for jet-like outflow (Stanek et al. 1999, Harrison et al. 1999). We report the detection of significant linear polarization in the afterglow: it is (1.6 /- 0.2)% 0.86 days after trigger, and after 1.81 days is consistent with that same value, but much more uncertain. The polarization angle is constant on a time scale of hours, and may be constant over one day. We conclude that the polarization is intrinsic to the source and due to the synchrotron nature of the emission, and discuss the random and ordered field geometries that may be responsible for it.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9911366,astro-ph,"We develop the theory of interstellar scintillation as caused by an irregular plasma having a power-law spatial density spectrum with a spectral exponent of 4 corresponding to a medium with abrupt changes in its density. An 'outer scale' is included in the model representing the typical scale over which the density of the medium remains uniform. Such a spectrum could be used to model plasma shock fronts in supernova remnants or other plasma discontinuities. We investigate and develop equations for the decorrelation bandwidth of diffractive scintillations and the refractive scintillation index and compare our results with pulsar measurements. We consider both a medium concentrated in a thin layer and an extended irregular medium. We conclude that the discontinuity model gives satisfactory agreement for many diffractive measurements, in particular the VLBI meaurements of the structure function exponent between 5/3 and 2. However, it gives less satisfactory agreement for the refractive scintillation index than does the Kolmogorov turbulence spectrum. The comparison suggests that the medium consists of a pervasive background distribution of turbulence embedded with randomly placed discrete plasma structures such as shocks or HII regions. This can be modeled by a composite spectrum following the Kolmogorov form at high wavenumbers and steepening at lower wavenumbers corresponding to the typical (inverse) size of the discrete structures. Such a model can also explain the extreme scattering events. However, lines of sight through the enhanced scattering prevalent at low galactic latitudes are accurately described by the Kolmogorov spectrum in an extended medium and do not appear to have a similar low-wavenumber steepening.",1999,[],5

We have obtained new times of maxima and the period change has been studied. We determined the fundamental physical parameters using the geometric distance of the star and the most recent synthetic colour grids. The results are:   [Fe/H]=-0.9/-0.2, Mbol=0.73/-0.43 mag, <Teff>=6800/-200 K, log g=2.7/-0.2, R=4.6/-0.9 Ro.   Additionally, we took medium resolution (lambda/Delta lambda=11000) spectra in the red spectral region centered at 6600 A. A complete radial velocity curve has been determined from 60 spectra. We found no systematic difference between the velocities from Halpha and metallic lines indicating a smooth pulsation. The mass of the star is found to be M=0.5/-0.3 Mo using the photometric log g value and the acceleration curve calculated from the radial velocity data. The finally adopted set of the physical parameters lies in the typical range of RR Lyrae stars, which implies that V2109 Cyg is the shortest period RR Lyrae-type variable. The visual amplitude vs. period and the Fourier amplitude parameter R21 vs. period diagrams suggest that V2109 Cyg probably pulsates in the second overtone mode.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9905279,astro-ph,"Nucleosynthesis in ONeMg novae has been investigated with the wide ranges of three parameters, i.e., the white dwarf mass, the envelope mass at ignition, and the initial composition. A quasi-analytic one-zone approach is used with an up-to-date nuclear reaction network. The nucleosynthesis results show correlation with the peak temperatures or the cooling timescales during outbursts. Among the combinations of white dwarf and envelope masses which give the same peak temperature, the explosion is more violent for a lower white dwarf mass owing to its smaller gravitational potential. Comparison of the nucleosynthesis results with observations implies that at least two-third of the white dwarf masses for the observed ONeMg novae are equation, which are significantly lower than estimated by previous hydrodynamic studies but consistent with the observations of V1974 Cyg. Moreover, the envelope masses derived from the comparison are equation, which are in good agreement with the ejecta masses estimated from observations but significantly higher than in previous hydrodynamic studies. With such a low mass white dwarf and a high mass envelope, the nova can produce interesting amounts of equation-ray emitters equationBe, equationNa, and equationAl. We suggest that V1974 Cyg has produced equationNa as high as the upper limit derived from the COMPTEL survey. In addition, a non-negligible part of the Galactic equationAl may originate from ONeMg novae, if not the major contributors. Both the future INTEGRAL survey for these equation-ray emitters and abundance estimates derived from ultraviolet, optical, and near infrared spectroscopies will impose a severe constraint on the current nova models.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9911047,astro-ph,"Spatial variations of the [S II]/H-Alpha and [N II]/H-Alpha line intensity ratios observed in the gaseous halo of the Milky Way and other galaxies are inconsistent with pure photoionization models. They appear to require a supplemental heating mechanism that increases the electron temperature at low densities ne. This would imply that in addition to photoionization, which has a heating rate per unit volume proportional to ne2, there is another source of heat with a rate per unit volume proportional to a lower power of ne. One possible mechanism is the dissipation of interstellar plasma turbulence, which according to Minter & Spangler (1997) heats the ionized interstellar medium in the Milky Way at a rate ~ 1x10-25 ne ergs cm-3 s-1. If such a source were present, it would dominate over photoionization heating in regions where ne < 0.1 cm-3, producing the observed increases in the [S II]/H-Alpha and [N II]/H-Alpha intensity ratios at large distances from the galactic midplane, as well as accounting for the constancy of [S II]/[N II], which is not explained by pure photoionization. Other supplemental heating sources, such as magnetic reconnection, cosmic rays, or photoelectric emission from small grains, could also account for these observations, provided they supply to the warm ionized medium ~ 10-5 ergs s-1 per cm2 of Galactic disk.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9901227,astro-ph,"This paper presents a statistical analysis of the circumgalactic environment of nearby Seyfert galaxies based on a computer-aided search of companion galaxies on the Digitized Sky Survey (DSS). An intrinsic difference between the environment of Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies, suggested by previous work, is confirmed as statistically significant. For Seyfert 2 galaxies we find a significant excess of large companions (diameter of companion >= 10 Kpc) within a search radius <= 100 Kpc of projected linear distance, as well as within a search radius equal to three times the diameter \ds of each Seyfert galaxy. For Seyfert 1 galaxies there is no clear evidence of any excess of companion galaxies neither within 100 Kpc, nor within 3\ds. For all samples the number of companions suggests a markedly non-Poissonian distribution for galaxies on scales <= 100 Kpc. This difference in environment is not compatible with the simplest formulation of the Unification Model for Seyferts: both types 1 and 2 should be intrinsicaly alike, the only difference being due to orientation of an obscuring torus.

Its success at K gives credence to its physical approach which is extrapolated to the L band (3.5 microns). We have analyzed the histograms of the pixel by pixel intensities in the 2.2 and 3.5 micron maps from DIRBE after subtracting the zodiacal light. The shape of these histograms agrees quite well with the histogram shape predicted using the Wainscoat et al. model of the infrared sky, but the predicted histograms must be displaced by a constant intensity in order to match the data. This shift is the cosmic infrared background, which is 16.9/-4.4 kJy/sr or 23.1/-5.9 nW/m2/sr at 2.2 microns, and 14.4/-3.7 kJy/sr or 12.4/-3.2 nW/m2/sr at 3.5 microns.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9906355,astro-ph,"We invoke star formation triggered by cloud-cloud collisions to explain global star formation rates of disk galaxies and circumnuclear starbursts. Previous theories based on the growth rate of gravitational perturbations ignore the dynamically important presence of magnetic fields. Theories based on triggering by spiral density waves fail to explain star formation in systems without such waves. Furthermore, observations suggest gas and stellar disk instabilities are decoupled. Following Gammie, Ostriker & Jog (1991), the cloud collision rate is set by the shear velocity of encounters with initial impact parameters of a few tidal radii, due to differential rotation in the disk. This, together with the effective confinement of cloud orbits to a two dimensional plane, enhances the collision rate above that for particles in a three dimensional box. We predict SigmaSFR(R) proportional to Sigmagas Omega (1-0.7 beta). For constant circular velocity (beta = 0), this is in agreement with recent observations (Kennicutt 1998). We predict a B-band Tully-Fisher relation: LB proportional to vcirc7/3, also consistent with observations.

The successful discovery of X-ray, optical and radio afterglows, which were predicted by theory, has made possible the identification of host galaxies at cosmological distances. The energy release inferred in these outbursts place them among the most energetic and violent events in the Universe. Current models envisage this to be the outcome of a cataclysmic event leading to a relativistically expanding fireball, in which particles are accelerated at shocks and produce nonthermal radiation. The substantial agreement between observations and the theoretical predictions of the standard fireball shock model provide confirmation of the basic aspects of this scenario. The continued observations show a diversity of behavior, providing valuable constraints for more detailed, post-standard models which incorporate more realistic physical features. Crucial questions being now addressed are the beaming at different energies and its implications for the energetics, the time structure of the afterglow, its dependence on the central engine or progenitor system behavior, and the role of the environment on the evolution of the afterglow.",1999,[],5

The sample studied here contains 812 quasars.   The method produces strong constraints (68% confidence limits) on the density parameter equation and weaker constraints on the cosmological constant equation, which can be expressed by the relation equation. Independently of equation (in the range equation), the constraint is equation.   Combination of the present results with SN Type Ia results yields equation equation (68% confidence limits).

astro-ph/9901223,astro-ph,"Radiative deceleration of relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei as the result of inverse Compton scattering of soft photons from accretion discs is discussed. The Klein-Nishina (KN) cross section is used in the calculation of the radiation force due to inverse Compton scattering. Our result shows that deceleration due to scattering in the KN regime is important only for jets starting with a bulk Lorentz factor larger than 1000. When the bulk Lorentz factor satisfies this condition, particles scattering in the Thomson regime contribute positively to the radiation force (acceleration), but those particles scattering in the KN regime are dominant and the overall effect is deceleration. In the KN limit, the drag due to Compton scattering, though less severe than in the Thomson limit, strongly constrains the bulk Lorentz factor. Most of the power from the deceleration goes into radiation and hence the ability of the jet to transport significant power (in particle kinetic energy) out of the subparsec region is severely limited. The deceleration efficiency decreases significantly if the jet contains protons and the proton to electron number density ratio satisfies the condition equation where equation is the minimum Lorentz factor of relativistic electrons (or positrons) in the jet frame and equation is the proton to electron mass ratio.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9901078,astro-ph,"We investigate equilibrium accretion flows dominated by equation pairs. We consider one- and two-temperature accretion disk coronae above a thin disk, as well as hot optically thin two-temperature accretion flows without an underlying thin disk; we model the latter in the framework of advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). In all three cases we include equipartition magnetic fields. We confirm the previous result that the equilibrium density of pairs in two-temperature ADAFs is negligible; and show that the inclusion of magnetic fields and the corresponding synchrotron cooling reduces the pair density even further. Similarly, we find that pairs are unimportant in two-temperature coronae. Even when the corona has significantly enhanced heating by direct transfer of viscous dissipation in the thin disk to the corona, the inefficient Coulomb coupling between protons and electrons acts as a bottleneck and prevents the high compactness required for pair-dominated solutions. Only in the case of a one-temperature corona model do we find pair-dominated thermal equilibria. These pair-dominated solutions occur over a limited range of optical depth and temperature.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9912417,astro-ph,"Six examples of the compact, isolated high-velocity HI clouds (CHVCs) identified by Braun and Burton (1999) have been imaged with the WSRT. The 65 confirmed objects in this class define a dynamically cold system, with a global minimum for the velocity dispersion of only 70 km/s, found in the Local Group Standard of Rest, while in-falling at 100 km/s toward the LG barycenter. These objects have a characteristic morphology, in which several compact cores are embedded in a diffuse halo. The compact cores typically account for 40% of the HI line flux while covering some 15% of the source area. The cores are the cool condensed phase of HI, the CNM, with temp. near 100 K, while the halos appear to be a shielding column of warm diffuse HI, the WNM, with temp. near 8000 K. We detect a core with one of the narrowest HI emission lines ever observed, with intrinsic FWHM of 2 km/s and 75 K brightness. From a comparison of column and volume densities we derive a distance in the range 0.5 to 1 Mpc. We determine a metallicity for this same object of 0.04 to 0.07 solar. Comparably high distances are implied by demanding the stability of objects with multiple cores, which show relative velocities as large as 70 km/s on 30 arcmin scales. Many compact cores show systematic velocity gradients along the major axis of their elliptical extent which are consistent with circular rotation. Several of the derived rotation curves are well-fit by Navarro, Frenk, and White (1997) cold dark matter profiles. These kinematic signatures imply a high dark-to-visible mass ratio of 10-50, for D=0.7Mpc, which scales as 1/D. The implied dark matter halos dominate the mass volume density within the central 2 kpc (10 arcmin) of each source, providing a sufficent hydrostatic pressure to allow local CNM condensation.

astro-ph/9912010,astro-ph,"We have used the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland-Association (BIMA) millimeter array outfitted with sensitive cm-wave receivers to search for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies on arcminute scales. The interferometer was placed in a compact configuration which produces high brightness sensitivity, while providing discrimination against point sources. Operating at a frequency of 28.5 GHz, the FWHM primary beam of the instrument is 6.6 arcminutes. We have made sensitive images of seven fields, five of which where chosen specifically to have low IR dust contrast and be free of bright radio sources. Additional observations with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) millimeter array were used to assist in the location and removal of radio point sources. Applying a Bayesian analysis to the raw visibility data, we place limits on CMB anisotropy flat-band power Qflat = 5.6 (3.0 -5.6) uK and Qflat < 14.1 uK at 68% and 95% confidence. The sensitivity of this experiment to flat band power peaks at a multipole of l = 5470, which corresponds to an angular scale of approximately 2 arcminutes. The most likely value of Qflat is similar to the level of the expected secondary anisotropies.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9908337,astro-ph,"Using a new grid of models of cooling white dwarfs, we calculate isochrones and luminosity functions in the Johnson-Kron/Cousins and HST filter sets for systems containing old white dwarfs. These new models incorporate a non-grey atmosphere which is necessary to properly describe the effects of molecular opacity at the cool temperatures of old white dwarfs. The various functions calculated and extensively tabulated and plotted are meant to be as utilitarian as possible for observers so all results are listed in quantities that observers will obtain. The tables and plots developed should eventually prove critical in interpreting the results of HST's Advanced Camera observations of the oldest white dwarfs in nearby globular clusters, in understanding the results of searches for old white dwarfs in the Galactic halo, and in determining ages for star clusters of all ages using white dwarfs. As a practical application we demonstrate the use of these results by deriving the white dwarf cooling age of the old Galactic cluster M67.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9909050,astro-ph,"The disruption of stellar systems, such as open clusters or stellar complexes, stands out as one of the most reasonable physical processes accounting for the young moving groups observed in the solar neighbourhood. In the present study we analyse some of the mechanisms that are important in the kinematic evolution of a group of unbound stars, such as the focusing phenomenon and its ability to recover the observed moving group's velocity dispersions, and the efficiency of disc heating and galactic differential rotation in disrupting unbound stellar systems. Our main tools used to perform this analysis are both the epicycle theory and the integration of the equations of motion using a realistic gravitational potential of the Galaxy. The study of the trajectories followed by stars in each of the Pleiades moving group substructures found by Asiain et al. (1999) allows us to determine their stellar spatial and velocity distribution evolution. The kinematic properties of these substructures are compared to those of a simulated stellar complex which has evolved under the influence of the galactic gravitational potential and the disc heating. We conclude that a constant diffusion coefficient compatible with the observational heating law is able to explain the velocity and spatial dispersions of the Pleiades moving group substructures that are younger than equation yr.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9903227,astro-ph,"The millisecond pulsar PSR B1620-26, in the globular cluster M4, has a white dwarf companion in a half-year orbit. Anomalously large variations in the pulsar's apparent spin-down rate have suggested the presence of a second companion in a much wider orbit. Using timing observations made on more than seven hundred days spanning eleven years, we confirm this anomalous timing behavior. We explicitly demonstrate, for the first time, that a timing model consisting of the sum of two non-interacting Keplerian orbits can account for the observed signal. Both circular and elliptical orbits are allowed, although highly eccentric orbits require improbable orbital geometries.   The motion of the pulsar in the inner orbit is very nearly a Keplerian ellipse, but the tidal effects of the outer companion cause variations in the orbital elements. We have measured the change in the projected semi-major axis of the orbit, which is dominated by precession-driven changes in the orbital inclination. This measurement, along with limits on the rate of change of other orbital elements, can be used to significantly restrict the properties of the outer orbit. We find that the second companion most likely has a mass m~0.01 Msun --- it is almost certainly below the hydrogen burning limit (m<0.036 Msun, 95% confidence) --- and has a current distance from the binary of ~35 AU and orbital period of order one hundred years. Circular (and near-circular) orbits are allowed only if the pulsar magnetic field is ~3x109 G, an order of magnitude higher than a typical millisecond pulsar field strength. In this case, the companion has mass m~1.2x10-3 Msun and orbital period ~62 years.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9909488,astro-ph,"We report results from the first simultaneous X-ray (RXTE) and optical (SAAO) observations of the low-mass X-ray binary GS 1826-24 in June 1998. A type-I burst was detected in both X-ray and optical wavelengths. Its energy-dependent profile, energetics and spectral evolution provide evidence for an increase in the X-ray but not fpr photospheric radius expansion. However, we may still derive an upper limit for its distance of equation kpc, assuming a peak flux of 2.8\times 10-8 erg cmequation sequation. A ~3 s optical delay with respect to the X-ray burst is also observed and we infer that this is related to the X-ray reprocessing in the accretion disk into the optical. This provides support for the recently proposed orbital period of ~2 h. We also present an ASCA observation from March 1998, during which two X-ray bursts were detected.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9906335,astro-ph,"We present results from detailed imaging of the centrally dominant radio elliptical galaxy in the cooling flow cluster Abell 2597, using data obtained with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). This object is one of the archetypal ""blue-lobed"" cooling flow radio elliptical galaxies, also displaying a luminous emission-line nebula, a compact radio source, and a significant dust lane and evidence of molecular gas in its center. We show that the radio source is surrounded by a complex network of emission-line filaments, some of which display a close spatial association with the outer boundary of the radio lobes. We present a detailed analysis of the physical properties of ionized and neutral gas associated with the radio lobes, and show that their properties are strongly suggestive of direct interactions between the radio plasma and ambient gas. We resolve the blue continuum emission into a series of knots and clumps, and present evidence that these are most likely due to regions of recent star formation. We investigate several possible triggering mechanisms for the star formation, including direct interactions with the radio source, filaments condensing from the cooling flow, or the result of an interaction with a gas-rich galaxy, which may also have been responsible for fueling the active nucleus. We propose that the properties of the source are plausibly explained in terms of accretion of gas by the cD during an interaction with a gas-rich galaxy, which combined with the fact that this object is located at the center of a dense, high-pressure ICM can account for the high rates of star formation and the strong confinement of the radio source.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9909298,astro-ph,"We present new semi-analytical models for the formation of disk galaxies with the purpose of investigating the origin of the near-infrared Tully-Fisher (TF) relation. The models assume that disks are formed by cooling of the baryons inside dark halos with realistic density profiles, and that the baryons conserve their specific angular momentum. Only gas with densities above the critical density given by Toomre's stability criterion is considered eligible for star formation, and a simple recipe for supernovae feedback is included. We emphasize the importance of extracting the proper luminosity and velocity measures from the models, something that has often been ignored in the past. The observed K-band TF relation has a slope that is steeper than simple predictions based on dynamical arguments suggest. Taking the stability related star formation threshold densities into account steepens the TF relation, decreases its scatter, and yields gas mass fractions that are in excellent agreement with observations. In order for the TF slope to be as steep as observed, further physics are required. We argue that the characteristics of the observed near-infrared TF relation do not reflect systematic variations in stellar populations, or cosmological initial conditions, but are governed by feedback. Finally we show that our models provide a natural explanation for the small amount of scatter that makes the TF relation useful as a cosmological distance indicator.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9906035,astro-ph,"We present a version of the Fourier Bessel method first introduced by Fisher et al (1994) and Zaroubi et al (1994) with two extensions: (a) we amend the formalism to allow a generic galaxy weight which can be constant rather than the more conventional overweighting of galaxies at high distances, and (b) we correct for the masked zones by extrapolation of Fourier Bessel modes rather than by cloning from the galaxy distribution in neighbouring regions. We test the procedure extensively on N-body simulations and find that it gives generally unbiased results but that the reconstructed velocities tend to be overpredicted in high-density regions. Applying the formalism to the PSZz redshift catalog, we find that beta = 0.7 /- 0.5 from a comparison of the reconstructed Local Group velocity to the CMB dipole. From an anisotropy test of the velocity field, we find that beta = 1 CDM models models normalized to the current cluster abundance can be excluded with 90% confidence. The density and velocity fields reconstructed agree with the fields found by Branchini et al (1998) in most points. We find a back-infall into the Great Attractor region (Hydra-Centaurus region) but tests suggest that this may be an artifact.

astro-ph/9905285,astro-ph,"A hot gas halo is predicted by chemodynamical models during the early evolution of spheroidal galaxies. Cold condensations, arising from thermal instabilities in the hot gas, are expected to be embedded in the hot halo. In the early phases of the galaxy (t < 1 Gyr), a strong X-ray and EUV emission is produced by the extended hot gas distribution, ionizing the cold clouds.

astro-ph/9909429,astro-ph,"Recent high-resolution studies of the L1544 protostellar core by Tafalla et al. and Williams et al. reveal the structure and kinematics of the gas. The observations of this prestellar core provide a natural test for theoretical models of core formation and evolution. Based on their results, the above authors claim a discrepancy with the implied infall motions from ambipolar diffusion models. In this paper, we reexamine the earlier ambipolar diffusion models, and conclude that the L1544 core can be understood to be a magnetically supercritical core undergoing magnetically diluted collapse. We also present a new model specifically designed to simulate the formation and evolution of the L1544 core. This model, which uses reasonable input parameters, yields mass and radial density distributions, as well as neutral and ion infall speed profiles, that are in very good agreement with physical values deduced by observations. The lifetime of the core is also in good agreement with prestellar core lifetimes estimated from statistics of an ensemble of cores. The observational input can act to constrain other currently unobserved quantities such as the degree of ionization, and the background magnetic field strength and orientation near the L1544 core.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9907292,astro-ph,"Using the VLA, we have performed the first observational test of dark matter in the form of cold, primordial fractal clouds, as envisioned by Pfenniger, Combes, & Martinet (1994) and Pfenniger & Combes (1994). We show that, after a Hubble Time, primordial fractal clouds will convert most of their HI to H2, but a small fraction of HI remains which is optically thick. This opens up a new window for detecting dark matter which may exist in this form. The detectability of such gas depends on its filling factor and temperature and therefore should be observable in absorption against a background source, with observations of sufficient sensitivity and resolution. The current VLA observations have made a first step towards this goal by taking advantage of a fortuitous alignment between the extension of the HI disk of the nearby galaxy, NGC 3079, and a background quasar Q 0957561. Our observations probe 28 independent beams against the quasar and all of velocity space between the extension of a flat rotation curve and a Keplerian decline for the halo region of NGC 3079. We do not detect any absorption features and investigate, in detail, the implication of this result for the hypothesis that dark matter is in the form of fractal clouds. While our analysis does not rule out fractal clouds as dark matter, it does lay out the groundwork for future, more sensitive observations and we consider what form these might take to probe the range of possible cloud properties more deeply. It is interesting that the observations can rule out cold optically thin HI gas, if it exists, to a limit of 0.001% of the dark matter. In contrast, the existence of cold HI in a fractal hierarchy would be an efficient way of hiding dark matter.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9909138,astro-ph,"During a BeppoSAX observation of the X-ray source X1746-371 located in the globular cluster NGC6441 a type I X-ray burst, parts of 4 intensity dips, and energy dependent flaring were detected. The dips repeat every 5.8 0.3 -0.9 hr and show no obvious energy dependence. If the dips are due to electron scattering this energy independence implies an abundance >130 times less than solar, confirming an earlier measurement. Since the overall cluster abundance is close to solar this low abundance is unexpected. Photoionization of the absorbing material, obscuration of an extended source, and variations in multiple components that combine to produce an apparent energy independence are all excluded. Thus, the nature of the dips remains uncertain. The best-fit model to the overall 0.3-30 keV spectrum is a disk-blackbody with a temperature of 2.82 /- 0.04 keV, together with a cutoff power-law with a photon index of -0.32 /- 0.80 and a cutoff energy of 0.90 /- 0.26 keV. Absorption, consistent with the optical extinction to NGC6441 of (0.28 /- 0.04) 1022 atom/cm2 is required. All previous best-fit spectral models for this source are excluded at high confidence. The spectrum is dominated by the blackbody-like component, with the cutoff power-law only contributing an average of 12% of the 1-10 keV flux. During flaring intervals the contribution of this component decreases to \~6% with variations in the intensity of the blackbody-like component being responsible for most of the flaring activity.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9910124,astro-ph,A set of CCD images have been obtained during the decline of the X-ray transient SAX J1808.4-3658 during April-June 1998. The optical counterpart has been confirmed by several pieces of evidence. The optical flux shows a modulation on several nights which is consistent with the established X-ray binary orbit period of 2 hours. This optical variability is roughly in antiphase with the weak X-ray modulation. The source mean magnitude of V=16.7 on April 18 declined rapidly after April 22. From May 2 onwards the magnitude was more constant at around V=18.45 but by June 27 was below our sensitivity limit. The optical decline precedes the rapid second phase of the X-ray decrease by 3 /- 1 days. The source has been identified on a 1974 UK Schmidt plate at an estimated magnitude of ~20.

astro-ph/9907153,astro-ph,"We have performed joint ASCA  ROSAT PSPC spectral fitting on the inner 5' of the bulge of M31. We find that single component spectral models provide an inadequate fit to the spectrum, in contrast to previous studies by Einstein and Ginga. Although the 2-10 keV spectrum can be fit adequately with a bremsstrahlung model with kT = 7.4 /- 0.3 keV, an additional soft component with kT = 0.38 /- 0.03 keV is required to fit the spectrum below 2 keV. This soft component comprises 38% /- 6% of the total emission in the 0.1-2.0 keV band, and possibly more depending on the absorption value used in the fit. Since previous spatial studies of the bulge of M31 indicate that < 25% of the X-ray emission from the bulge in this band is from a diffuse gaseous component, this implies that stellar sources, namely low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), are responsible for some if not all of the soft component. The spectral properties of M31 are very similar to those of the X-ray faint early-type galaxy NGC4382. This supports the claim that the unexplained soft X-ray emission seen previously in these galaxies also emanates from LMXBs.",1999,[],5

We find that source location and motion have significant effects on the red wing and blue horn of the line profiles. The disk region under the source will receive more flux, which is the most important factor to affect the line profiles. We suggest that at least part of the variation in Fe K-alpha line profiles is caused by the motion of X-ray sources. Future observations of Fe K-alpha line profiles will provide more information about the distribution and motion of the X-ray sources around black holes, and hence the underlying physics.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9906226,astro-ph,"By considering the radiative force by a circumnuclear starburst as well as an AGN, we analyze the equilibrium configuration and the stability of dusty gas in the circumnuclear regions. It is found that the radiative force by an intensive starburst can support a stable gaseous wall with a scale-height of several hundred parsecs. Moreover, by taking the simple stellar evolution in the starburst into account, we find that the covering factor of the wall decreases on a time-scale of several equation yr. The large-scale wall, if formed, works to obscure the nucleus due to the dust opacity. Hence, it is anticipated that the index of AGN type tends to shift from higher to lower in several equation yr according as the circumnuclear starburst becomes dimmer. On the other hand, if the AGN itself is brighter than the circumnuclear starburst (e.g. quasar case), no stable large-scale wall forms. In that case, the AGN is highly probably identified as type 1. The present mechanism may provide a physical explanation for the putative correlation between AGN type and host properties that Sy2's are more frequently associated with circumnuclear starbursts than Sy1's, whereas quasars are mostly observed as type 1 regardless of star-forming activity in the host galaxies.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9912449,astro-ph,"We consider height-integrated equations of an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF), assuming that there is no mass outflow. We include convection through a mixing length formalism. We seek self-similar solutions in which the rotational velocity and sound speed scale as R-1/2, where R is the radius, and consider two limiting prescriptions for the transport of angular momentum by convection. In one limit, the transport occurs down the angular velocity gradient, so convection moves angular momentum outward. In the other, the transport is down the specific angular momentum gradient, so convection moves angular momentum inward. We also consider general prescriptions which lie in between the two limits.   When convection moves angular momentum outward, we recover the usual self-similar solution for ADAFs in which the mass density scales as rho ~ R-3/2. When convection moves angular momentum inward, the result depends on the viscosity coefficient alpha. If alpha>alphacrit1 ~ 0.05, we once again find the standard ADAF solution. For alpha<alphacrit, however, we find a non-accreting solution in which rho ~ R-1/2. We refer to this as a ""convective envelope"" solution or a ""convection-dominated accretion flow"".   Two-dimensional numerical simulations of ADAFs with values of alpha<0.03 have been reported by several authors. The simulated ADAFs exhibit convection. By virtue of their axisymmetry, convection in these simulations moves angular momentum inward, as we confirm by computing the Reynolds stress. The simulations give rho ~ R-1/2, in good agreement with the convective envelope solution. The R-1/2 density profile is not a consequence of mass outflow.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9910426,astro-ph,"We present Hubble Space Telescope Planetary Camera UVI data for the little-studied cluster Hodge 301 3' northwest of 30 Doradus' central ionizing cluster R136. The average reddening of Hodge 301 is found to be <E(B-V)> = (0.28-0.05) mag from published infrared and ultraviolet photometry. Using two different sets of evolutionary models, we derive an age of ~ 20-25 Myr for Hodge 301, which makes it roughly 10 times as old as R136. Hodge 301 is the most prominent representative of the oldest population in the 30 Dor starburst region; a region that has undergone multiple star formation events. This range of ages is an important consideration for the modelling of starburst regions. Hodge 301 shows a widened upper main sequence largely caused by Be stars. We present a list of Be star candidates. The slope of the initial mass function for intermediate-mass main sequence stars ranging from 10 to 1.3 solar masses is found to be -1.4-0.1 in good agreement with a Salpeter law. There is no indication for a truncation or change of slope of the IMF within this mass range. In accordance with the age of Hodge 301 no obvious pre-main-sequence stars are seen down to 1 solar mass.

It is found that candidate sets of solutions exist which allow the ONC to be in virial equilibrium, expanding or contracting. The range of possible solutions is quite narrow.   These results will serve as guidelines for future, CPU-intensive calculations of the stellar-dynamical and astrophysical evolution of the entire ONC.

astro-ph/9912227,astro-ph,"This paper is the third in a series, studying the optical properties of a sample of mid-IR Warm Seyfert galaxies and of a control sample of mid-IR Cold galaxies. The present paper is devoted to surface photometry. We analyse the light distributions characterizing the galaxies outside the central 2 kpc. The radial light profiles are decomposed, using two generalized exponentials, in inner and outer components. Each is characterized by the profile shape, central surface brightness and scale length. We find that light is more centrally concentrated in Seyfert 1s, that also tend to lie in earlier-type hosts than Seyfert 2s. Seyfert 1 and 2 bulges have similar shapes but the former are characterized by larger central surface brightnesses and smaller scale lengths. The three parameters characterizing the bulge component correlate with each other, within a limited range of bulge luminosities. Cold galaxies are disk-dominated systems, with complex morphologies. Their bulges are flatter and fainter compared to the Warm sample. The disk structural parameters span similar ranges for the three (sub)samples but with larger scatter.

astro-ph/9901206,astro-ph,"We generate bolometric light curves for a variety of type Ia supernova models at late times, simulating gamma-ray and positron transport for various assumptions about the magnetic field and ionization of the ejecta. These calculated light curve shapes are compared with light curves of specific supernovae for which there have been adequate late observations. %The selection of models is generally not based upon the %ability to fit the late observations, but rather because the %model has been demonstrated by other authors to approximate the spectra %and early light curves of that specific SN.   From these comparisons we draw two conclusions: whether a suggested model is an acceptable approximation of a particular event, and, given that it is, the magnetic field characteristics and degree of ionization that are most consistent with the observed light curve shape. For the ten SNe included in this study, five strongly suggest equationCo positron escape as would be permitted by a weak or radially-combed magnetic field. Of the remaining five SNe, none clearly show the upturned light curve expected for positron trapping in a strong, tangled magnetic field. Chandrasekhar mass models can explain normally, sub-, and super- luminous supernova light curves; sub-Chandrasekhar mass models have difficulties with sub- (and potentially normally) luminous SNe. An estimate of the galactic positron production rate from type Ia SNe is compared with gamma-ray observations of Galactic 511 keV annihilation radiation. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of correctly treating the positron transport for calculations of spectra, or any properties, of type Ia SNe at late epochs (equation 200 d).",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9906057,astro-ph,"High resolution spectra of 5 candidate metal-weak thick-disc stars suggested by Beers & Sommer-Larsen (1995) are analyzed to determine their chemical abundances. The low abundance of all the objects has been confirmed with metallicity reaching [Fe/H]=-2.9. However, for three objects, the astrometric data from the Hipparcos catalogue suggests they are true halo members. The remaining two, for which proper-motion data are not available, may have disc-like kinematics. It is therefore clear that it is useful to address properties of putative metal-weak thick-disc stars only if they possess full kinematic data. For CS 22894-19 the abundance pattern similar to those of typical halo stars is found, suggesting that chemical composition is not a useful discriminant between thick-disc and halo stars. CS 29529-12 is found to be C enhanced with [C/Fe]=1.0; other chemical peculiarities involve the s process elements: [Sr/Fe]=-0.65 and [Ba/Fe]=0.62, leading to a high [Ba/Sr] considerably larger than what is found in more metal-rich carbon-rich stars, but similar to LP 706-7 and LP 625-44 discussed by Norris et al (1997a). Hipparcos data have been used to calculate the space velocities of 25 candidate metal-weak thick-disc stars, thus allowing us to identify 3 bona fide members, which support the existence of a metal-poor tail of the thick-disc, at variance with a claim to the contrary by Ryan & Lambert (1995).",1999,[],5

The images, acquired with the ARNICA camera mounted on various telescopes, are used to derive radial profiles of surface brightness, ellipticities, and position angles, together with global parameters such as H-band magnitudes and diameters. The mean relation between H-band isophotal diameter D21.5 and the B-band D25 implies a B-H color of the outer disk bluer than 3.5; moreover, D21.5/D25 depends on (global) color and absolute luminosity. The correlations among the various photometric parameters suggest a ratio between isophotal radius D21.5/2 and disk scale length of about 3.5 and a mean disk central brightness of 17.5 H-mag arcsec-2. We confirm the trend of the concentration index C31 with absolute luminosity and, to a lesser degree, with morphological type.

We show that in the framework of this picture the observed range of Hequation FWHM from Broad Line to Narrow Line type 1 AGN is well reproduced as a function of the accretion rate.

astro-ph/9902229,astro-ph,"ISOCAM extragalactic mid-infrared deep surveys have detected a population of strong IR emitters ten times more numerous than expected if there were no evolution from z<0.2 (IRAS) up to the maximum redshift of these galaxies (z=1.5). The mid-IR cosmic background produced by these galaxies (2.35/-0.8 nW m-2 sr-1, at 15 microns above 50 microJy) is larger than 30 per cent of the energy radiated in the I band by the optical galaxies detected in the HDF, which are two orders of magnitude more numerous. This fraction is much higher than in the local universe (z<0.2) as probed by IRAS, where all integrated IR emission from 8 to 1000 microns makes 30 per cent of the optical starlight. Even assuming a conservative SED, they produce a major contribution to the 140 mu m DIRBE background measured by Hauser et al. (1998, 25.1/-7 nW m-2 sr-1) and Lagache et al. (1999, 15.3/-9.5 nW m -2 sr-1). This is both a confirmation of the strong IR cosmic background that was first detected by Puget et al. (1996) and the first identification of the galaxies responsible for a large fraction of this background at 140 microns. We find that these bright (several 1011 Lsol) and massive (<M>= 1.5x1011 Msol) IR galaxies have a typical redshift of z=0.7 and optical colors similar to field galaxies. The fraction of galaxies with morphological signs of interactions is larger at higher redshift. This is consistent with the nature of local luminous IR galaxies found by IRAS, which often exhibit evidence of galaxy interaction or merging and indicates that interactions should play a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies as expected from bottom-up scenarios.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9911528,astro-ph,"We present the I-band luminosity function of the red giant branch stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the data from the Magellanic Clouds Photometric Survey (Zaritsky, Harris & Thompson, 1997). Selecting stars in uncrowded, low-extinction regions, a discontinuity in the luminosity function is observed at I0 = 14.54 mag. Identifying this feature with the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB), and adopting an absolute TRGB magnitude of -4.05 - 0.04 mag based on the calibration of Lee, Freedman & Madore (1993), we obtain a distance modulus of 18.59 - 0.09 (random) - 0.16 (systematic) mag. If the theoretical TRGB calibration provided by Cassisi & Salaris (1997) is adopted instead, the derived distance would be 4% greater. The LMC distance modulus reported here, 18.59 - 0.09, is larger by 0.09 mag (1-sigma) than the value that is most commonly used in the extragalactic distance scale calibrated by the period-luminosity relation of the Cepheid variable stars. Our TRGB distance modulus agrees with several RR Lyrae distances to the LMC based on HIPPARCOS parallaxes. Finally, we note that using the same MCPS data, we obtain a distance modulus of 18.29 - 0.03 mag using the red clump method, which is shorter by 0.3 mag compared to the TRGB estimate.",1999,[],5

Emission lines are also seen in the spectrum of Sco X-2, confirming the identity of the IR counterpart. We report the detection of CO bands in GX131 and estimate the most likely spectral type of the secondary to be K5 III. We also find P Cygni type profiles in the Brackett gamma lines of Sco X-1 and GX131, indicating the presence of high velocity outflows in these systems.

It is demonstrated that there is a mass exchange instability in some range of mass ratio for the two components. We show that the assumption of \it constant volume of the secondary should be relaxed in DSC model. For \it all mass ratio the secondary alway satisfies the condition that no mass flow returns to the primary through the inner Lagrangian point. The secondary will expand in order to equilibrate the interaction between the common convective envelope and the secondary. The contact discontinuity in contact binary undergoing thermal relaxation does not violate the second law of thermodynamics. The maintaining condition of contact discontinuity is derived in the time-dependent model. It is desired to improve the TRO model with the advanced contact discontinuity layer in future detailed calculations.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9908324,astro-ph,"We discuss the time variation of dust-to-gas mass ratio in spiral galaxies using the multi-phase model of interstellar medium. The typical timescale of the phase change of an interstellar gas is equation--equation yr in spiral galaxies. Since the phase transition changes the filling factor of the cold gas where the dust growth occurs, the dust growth rate varies on that timescale. In order to examine the response of the dust-to-gas ratio to the phase transition, we construct a model of the time evolution of the dust-to-gas ratio. We adopt the three phase model for the interstellar gas and the Ikeuchi-Tomita model for the mass exchange among the phases. According to the model, three types of solutions are possible: [1] all the gas is transformed to a hot gas; [2] a stable stationary state of three phases is realized; [3] the filling factor of each phase cyclically changes. For each of the three types of solutions, the dust-to-gas ratio behaves as follows: [1] almost all the dust is destroyed (the dust-to-gas ratio becomes equation); [2] the dust-to-gas ratio converges to a stationary state; [3] the dust-to-gas ratio varies cyclically in response to the phase transition. In the case of [3], the amplitude of the variation of the dust-to-gas ratio is large (nearly an order of magnitude) if the dust growth timescale is shorter than the phase transition timescale. This condition is easily satisfied in spiral galaxies. However, it is difficult for dwarf galaxies to realize the condition because their small metallicity makes the dust growth timescale long.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9912252,astro-ph,"We present illustrative models for the UV to millimeter emission of starburst galaxies which are treated as an ensemble of optically thick giant molecular clouds (GMCs) centrally illuminated by recently formed stars. The models follow the evolution of the GMCs due to the ionization-induced expansion of the HII regions and the evolution of the stellar population within the GMC according to the Bruzual & Charlot stellar population synthesis models. The effect of transiently heated dust grains/PAHs to the radiative transfer, as well as multiple scattering, is taken into account.   The expansion of the HII regions and the formation of a narrow neutral shell naturally explains why the emission from PAHs dominates over that from hot dust in the near to mid-IR, an emerging characteristic of the infrared spectra of starburst galaxies.   The models allow us to relate the observed properties of a galaxy to its age and star formation history. We find that exponentially decaying 107-108 yrs old bursts can explain the IRAS colours of starburst galaxies. The models are also shown to account satisfactorily for the multiwavelength data on the prototypical starburst galaxy M82 and NGC6090, a starburst galaxy recently observed by ISO. In M82 we find evidence for two bursts separated by 107yrs. In NGC6090 we find that at least part of the far-IR excess may be due to the age of the burst (6.4 x 107yrs). We also make predictions about the evolution of the luminosity of starbursts at different wavelengths which indicate that far-IR surveys may preferentially detect older starbursts than mid-IR surveys.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9907096,astro-ph,"We estimate the fraction of the total energy in a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) that is radiated in photons during the main burst. Random internal collisions among different shells limit the efficiency for converting bulk kinetic energy to photons. About 1% of the energy of explosion is converted to radiation, in 10-1000 kev energy band in the observer frame, for long duration bursts (lasting 10s or more); the efficiency is significantly smaller for shorter duration bursts. Moreover, about 50% of the energy of the initial explosion could be lost to neutrinos during the early phase of the burst if the initial fireball temperature is about 10 Mev or greater. If isotropic, the total energy budget of the brightest GRBs is about equationerg, a factor of more than 20 larger than previously estimated. Anisotropy of explosion, as evidenced in two GRBs, could reduce the energy requirement by a factor of 10-100.

The code, named COSMOS, possesses several new features which distinguish it from other PM-PPM codes. In particular, to solve the Poisson equation we have written a new multigrid solver which can determine the gravitational potential of isolated matter distributions and which properly takes into account the finite-volume discretization required by PPM. All components of the code are constructed to work with a nonuniform mesh, preserving second-order spatial differences. The PPM code uses vacuum boundary conditions for isolated problems, preventing inflows when appropriate. The PM code uses a second-order variable-timestep time integration scheme. Radiative cooling and cosmological expansion terms are included. COSMOS has been implemented for parallel computers using the Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) library, and it features a modular design which simplifies the addition of new physics and the configuration of the code for different types of problems.

astro-ph/9902017,astro-ph,"Recent studies suggest that when cold nuclear matter is compressed to high nuclear densities, diquarks with spin zero and antisymmetric color wave function Bose condensate into a superfluid/superconducting state that is several times as dense. Various astrophysical phenomena may be explained by gravitational collapse of neutron stars (NSs) to (di)quark stars (QSs) as a result of a first order phase transition in NSs within equation years after their birth in supernova explosions, when they cooled and spun down sufficiently (by magnetic braking ?). The gravitational energy release drives an explosion which may eject both highly relativistic narrowly collimated jets and a mildly relativistic 'spherical' shell. The slow contraction/cooling of the remnant QSs can power soft gamma ray repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs), without invoking a huge magnetic energy storage. The jets can produce the observed gamma ray bursts (GRBs) in distant galaxies when they happen to point in our direction and the GRBs afterglows. Also the expanding shell from the explosion may produce a GRB afterglow. The jets distort the original SNR, sweep up ambient matter along their trajectories, accelerate it to cosmic ray (CR) energies and disperse it in hot spots which they form when they stop in the galactic halo. Such events in our Galaxy may be the main source of Galactic cosmic rays at all energies.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9901179,astro-ph,"The three-dimensional distribution of astronomical objects observed in redshift space significantly differs from the true distribution since the distance to each object cannot be determined by its redshift equation only; for equation the peculiar velocity field contaminates the true recession velocity of the Hubble flow, while the true distance for objects at equation sensitively depends on the (unknown and thus assumed) cosmological parameters. This hampers the effort to understand the true distribution of large-scale structure of the universe. In addition, all cosmological observations are carried out on a light-cone, the null hypersurface of an observer at equation. This implies that their intrinsic properties and clustering statistics should change even within the survey volume. Therefore a proper comparison taking account of the light-cone effect is important to extract any cosmological information from redshift catalogues, especially for equation.

We make the first unequivocal identification of iron-rich ejecta produced by explosive silicon-burning in a young Galactic SNR. Elsewhere in the remnant we see silicon-rich ejecta from explosive oxygen-burning. Remarkably, our study finds that the Fe-rich ejecta lies outside the Si-rich material, leading to the conclusion that bulk motions of the ejecta were extensive and energetic enough in Cas A to cause a spatial inversion of a significant portion of the supernova core during the explosion. It is likely that this inversion was caused by 'Fe'-rich ejecta emerging in plumes from the rising bubbles in the neutrino-driven convection layer.

They are 2-5 times fainter than the hosts of radio-loud QSOs at the same epoch. Compared to low redshifts, RQQ hosts at z~2 also support higher nuclear luminosities at given stellar host mass.

astro-ph/9906259,astro-ph,"We present quantitative predictions for the abundances of r-process elements in stars formed very early in the Galactic history using a phenomenological two-component r-process model based on the I129 and Hf182 inventory in the early solar system. This model assumes that a standard mass of the ISM dilutes the debris from an individual supernova. High frequency supernova H events and low frequency supernova L events are proposed in the model with characteristics determined by the meteoritic data on I129 and Hf182. The yields in an H or L event are obtained from these characteristics and the solar r-process abundances under the assumption that the yield template for the high mass (A > 130) nuclei associated with W182 or the low mass (A < or = 130) nuclei associated with I127 is the same for both the H and L events and follows the corresponding solar r-pattern in each mass region. The abundance of Eu, not Fe, is proposed as a key guide to the age of very metal-poor stars. We predict that stars with log epsilon (Eu) = -2.98 to -2.22 were formed from an ISM contaminated most likely by a single H event within the first 10**7 yr of the Galactic history and should have an Ag/Eu abundance ratio less than the corresponding solar r-process value by a factor of at least 10. Many of the very metal-poor stars observed so far are considered here to have been formed from an ISM contaminated by many (about 10) r-process events. Stars formed from an ISM contaminated only by a pure L event would have an Ag/Eu ratio higher than the corresponding solar r-process value but would be difficult to find due to the low frequency of the L events. However, variations in the relative abundances of the low and high mass regions should be detectable in very metal-poor stars.",1999,[],5

Unlike NASA's Space Interferometry Mission (SIM), which will achieve similar accuracies but is a pointed instrument, GAIA will be able to construct a global catalogue of the halo. Here we study proper motions of giant branch stars in a tidal debris torn from a small satellite system in the halo. We follow the evolution of a cold stream on a polar orbit between 8-50 kpc in a variety of histories of the Galactic potential, and observe the bright (equationmag) members of the debris tail with GAIA accuracy. We simulate effects due to the growing or flipping of the Galactic disk over the past 4 Gyrs or the perturbation from a massive accreted lump such as the progenitor of the Magellanic Clouds. Our simulations suggest that the results of Johnston, Zhao, Spergel & Hernquist (1999) and Helmi, Zhao & de Zeeuw (1999) for static Galactic potentials are likely to be largely generalizable to realistic time-dependent potentials: a tidal debris remains cold in spite of evolution and non-axial symmetry of the potential. GAIA proper motion measurements of debris stars might be used to probe both Galactic structure and Galactic history. We also study several other factors influencing our ability to identify streams, including accuracy of radial velocity and parallax data from GAIA, and contamination from random field stars.

(1994) predict those parameters finely, and furthermore, the applied transformation from the theoretical (log g-Teff) to the observational (Mv-B-V) plane is precise enough to derive radii with an uncertainty of ~ 6%, masses within ~ 8%, and Teffs within ~ 2% for a certain range of the stellar parameters. This is demonstrated by means of comparison with the measurements in eclipsing binaries and the InfraRed Flux Method.   The application of the interpolation procedure in the theoretical isochrones to the stars within 100 pc from the Sun observed with Hipparcos provides estimates for 17,219 stars",1999,[],5

The 0.1-100 keV spectrum of Mkn421 shows continuous convex curvature that can be interpreted as the high-energy end of the synchrotron emission. The source shows significant short-term temporal and spectral variability, which can be interpreted in terms of synchrotron cooling. The comparison of our results with those of previous observations when the source was a factor 3-5 fainter shows evidence for strong spectral variability, with the maximum of the synchrotron power shifting to higher energy during high states. This behaviour suggest an increase in the number of energetic electrons during high states.",1999,[],5

Very little is known about these objects, the critical issue being whether they are old ellipticals at z>1 or distant star-forming galaxies strongly reddened by dust extinction. We expect to shed light onto the unknown nature of these galaxies by completing our three-step project: (1) the construction of two very deep optical/NIR surveys to select ERGs, (2) subsequent VLT/NIR spectroscopy; (3) observations in the sub-mm region with SCUBA at the JCMT and with MPIfRbolo at the IRAM 30m antenna.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9903284,astro-ph,"The last decade has witnessed significant advances in our observational understanding of the earliest stages of low-mass star formation. The advent of sensitive receivers on large radio telescopes such as the JCMT and IRAM 30m MRT has led to the identification of young protostars at the beginning of the main accretion phase (`Class 0' objects), and has made it possible to probe, for the first time, the inner density structure of pre-collapse cores. Class 0 objects are characterized by strong, centrally-condensed dust continuum emission at submillimeter wavelengths, very little emission shortward of 10 microns, and powerful jet-like outflows. Direct evidence for gravitational infall has been observed toward several of them. They are interpreted as accreting protostars which have not yet accumulated the majority of their final stellar mass. In contrast to protostars, pre-stellar cores have flat inner density profiles, suggesting the initial conditions for fast protostellar collapse depart sometimes significantly from a singular isothermal sphere. In the case of non-singular initial conditions, the beginning of protostellar evolution is expected to feature a brief phase of vigorous accretion/ejection which may coincide with Class 0 objects. In addition, submillimeter continuum imaging surveys of regions of multiple star formation such as Ophiuchus and Serpens suggest a picture according to which each star in an embedded cluster is built from a finite reservoir of mass and the associated IMF is primarily determined at the pre-stellar stage of evolution.",1999,[],5

It is however not clear why and how these companion galaxies are physically associated with the activation of QSO nucleus and the formation of QSO hosts. We here demonstrate that QSO companion galaxies are tidally formed by a gas-rich major galaxy merger and then orbit the merger remnant, based on the results of numerical simulations which investigate both gas fueling to the central seed massive black holes in the merger and global morphological evolution of the merger. We furthermore suggest that some of companion galaxies tidally formed in a major merger can evolve eventually into small compact elliptical galaxies observed frequently in the present-day bright massive galaxies.

astro-ph/9905176,astro-ph,"The present work considers diffusive shock acceleration at non-relativistic shocks using a system of stochastic differential equations (SDE) equivalent to the Fokker-Planck equation. We compute approximate solutions of the transport of cosmic particles at shock fronts with a SDE numerical scheme. The momentum gain is given by implicit calculations of the fluid velocity gradients using a linear interpolation between two consecutive time steps. We validate our procedure in the case of single shock acceleration with different shock thickness, with or without synchrotron losses. A comparative discussion of implicit and explicit schemes for different shock thickness shows that implicit calculations extend the range of applicability of SDE schemes to infinitely thin 1D shocks. The method is then applied to multiple shock acceleration for a system of identical shocks which free parameters are the distance between two consecutive shocks, the synchrotron losses time and the escape time of the particles. The stationary distribution reproduces quite well the flat differential logarithm energy distribution produced by multiple shock effect, and also the piling-up effect due synchrotron losses at a momentum where they equilibrate the acceleration rate. At higher momenta particle losses dominate and the spectrum drops. The competition between acceleration and loss effects leads to a pile-up shaped distribution which appears to be effective only in a restrict range of inter-shock distances of 10-100 diffusion lengths. We finally compute the optically thin synchrotron spectrum produced such periodic pattern which can explain flat and/or inverted spectra observed in Flat Radio spectrum Quasars and in the galactic centre.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9907362,astro-ph,"The recent model of quasi-periodic oscillations in neutron star binaries (Osherovich and Titarchuk 1999, Titarchuk and Osherovich 1999) has suggested the existence of two branches of QPOs due to the influence of Coriolis force on the linear Keplerian oscillator: one branch with frequencies from 400 to 1200 Hz and another branch with frequencies an order of magnitude lower. The frequencies of the high branch nuh hold a hybrid frequency relation with the Keplerian frequency nuK: nuh2=nuK2 [Omega/pi]2, where Omega is the rotational frequency of the star's magnetosphere. The frequency of the low branch is nuL=(Omega/pi)(nuK/nuh) sin(delta), where delta is a small angle between vector Omega and the vector normal to the plane of Keplerian oscillations. The observations of the source 4U 1702-42 (Markwardt et al 1999) have shown that the centroid of the 35 Hz QPO tracks the frequency of the kilohertz oscillations. We interpret the 35 Hz oscillations as nuL and find delta=3.9o /- 0.2o. Our results make 4U 1702-42 the second source (after Sco X-1) for which the theoretically derived lower branch is identified (within our model) and delta is calculated. The inferred angle delta stays approximately the same over the significant range of nuK (650 - 900 Hz), as expected from the model.

astro-ph/9906445,astro-ph,"We present simultaneous ASCA and RXTE observations of Ark 564, the brightest known 'narrow-line' Seyfert 1 in the 2-10 keV band. The measured X-ray spectrum is dominated by a steep (Gamma~2.7) power-law continuum extending to at least 20 keV, with imprinted Fe K-line and -edge features and an additional 'soft excess' below ~1.5 keV. The energy of the iron K-edge indicates the presence of highly ionised material, which we identify in terms of reflection from a strongly irradiated accretion disc. The high reflectivity of this putative disc, together with its strong intrinsic O VIII Ly-alpha and O VIII recombination emission, can also explain much of the observed soft excess flux. Furthermore, the same spectral model also provides a reasonable match to the very steep 0.1-2 keV spectrum deduced from ROSAT data. The source is much more rapidly variable than 'normal' Seyfert 1s of comparable luminosity, increasing by a factor of ~50% in 1.6 hours, with no measurable lag between the 0.5-2 keV and 3-12 keV bands, consistent with much of the soft excess flux arising from reprocessing of the primary power-law component in the inner region of the accretion disc. We note, finally, that if the unusually steep power-law component is a result of Compton cooling of a disc corona by an intense soft photon flux, then the implication is that the bulk of these soft photons lie in the unobserved extreme ultraviolet.",1999,[],5

On 1996 June 18, in the midst of this intensive monitoring period, we obtained a high signal-to-noise snapshot of the UV spectrum from 1150-3300 A using the FOS on HST. This spectrum allows us to disentangle the UV continuum more accurately from the broad wings of the emission lines, to identify clean continuum windows free of contaminating emission and absorption, and to deblend line complexes such as LyaNV, CIVHeIIOIII], SiIII]CIII], and MgIIFeII. Using the FOS spectrum as a template, we have fit and extracted line and continuum fluxes from the IUE monitoring data. The cleaner continuum extractions confirm the discovery of time delays between the different UV continuum bands by Wanders et al. Our new measurements show delays increasing with wavelength for continuum bands centered at 1485 A, 1740 A and 1825 A relative to 1315 A with delays of 0.09, 0.28 and 0.36 days, respectively. Like many other Seyfert 1 galaxies, the UV spectrum of NGC 7469 shows intrinsic, blue-shifted absorption in Lya, NV and C IV. Soft X-ray absorption is also visible in archival ASCA X-ray spectra. The strength of the UV absorption, however, is not compatible with a single-zone model in which the same material absorbs both the UV and X-ray light. Similar to other Seyfert galaxies such as NGC 3516, the UV-absorbing gas in NGC 7469 has a lower ionization parameter and column density than the X-ray absorbing material. While the UV and X-ray absorption does not arise in the same material, the frequent occurrence of both associated UV absorption and X-ray warm absorbers in the same galaxies suggests that the gas supply for each has a common origin.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9905142,astro-ph,"We use 11/2 dimensional particle-in-cell plasma simulations to study the interaction of a relativistic, strongly magnetized wind with an ambient medium. Such an interaction is a plausible mechanism which leads to generation of cosmological gamma-ray bursts. We confirm the idea of Meszaros and Rees (1992) that an essential part (about 20%) of the energy that is lost by the wind in the process of its deceleration may be transferred to high-energy electrons and then to high-frequency (X-ray and gamma-ray) emission. We show that in the wind frame the spectrum of electrons which are accelerated at the wind front and move ahead of the front is nearly a two-dimensional relativistic Maxwellian with a relativistic temperature equation K, where equation with the accuracy of ~20%, and equation is the Lorentz factor of the wind, equation for winds outflowing from cosmological gamma-ray bursters. Our simulations point to an existence of a high-energy tail of accelerated electrons with a Lorentz factor of more than equation. Large-amplitude electromagnetic waves are generated by the oscillating currents at the wind front. The mean field of these waves ahead of the wind front is an order of magnitude less than the magnetic field of the wind. High-energy electrons which are accelerated at the wind front and injected into the region ahead of the front generate synchro-Compton radiation in the fields of large-amplitude electromagnetic waves. This radiation closely resembles synchrotron radiation and can reproduce the non-thermal radiation of gamma-ray bursts observed in the Ginga and BATSE ranges (from a few keV to a few MeV).",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9910567,astro-ph,"We have carried out model calculations of the photoionized intergalactic medium (IGM) to determine the effects on the predicted ionic column densities due to uncertainties in the published dielectronic recombination (DR) rate coefficients. Based on our previous experimental work and a comparison of published theoretical DR rates, we estimate there is in general a factor of 2 uncertainty in existing DR rates used for modeling the IGM. We demonstrate that this uncertainty results in factors of ~1.9 uncertainty in the predicted N V and Si IV column densities, ~1.6 for O VI, and ~1.7 for C IV. We show that these systematic uncertainties translate into a systematic uncertainty of up to a factor of ~3.1 in the Si/C abundance ratio inferred from observations. The inferred IGM abundance ratio could thus be less than the solar Si/C ratio or greater than 3 times the solar ratio. If the latter is true, then it suggests the metagalactic radiation field is not due purely to active galactic nuclei, but includes a significant stellar component. Lastly, column density ratios of Si IV to C IV versus C II to C IV are often used to constrain the decrement in the metagalactic radiation field at the He II absorption edge. We show that the variation in the predicted Si IV to C IV ratio due to a factor of 2 uncertainty in the DR rates is almost as large as that due to a factor of 10 change in the decrement. Laboratory measurements of the relevant DR resonance strengths and energies are the only unambiguous method to remove the effects of these atomic physics uncertainties from models of the IGM.",1999,[],5

We describe the spectrum obtained at the maximum of flux and we demonstrate that it is very different from spectra of other soft X-ray transients at similar luminosity.

Our principal result is a clear quantitative separation of luminosity and density evolution for different galaxy populations, and the finding that the character of the LF evolution is strongly dependent on galaxy type. Specifically, the early- and intermediate-type LF's show primarily brightening at higher redshifts and only modest density evolution, while the late-type LF is best fit by strong number density increases at higher z, with little luminosity evolution. We also carefully measure and account for sample selection effects as functions of galaxy magnitude and color, and show that our results are not significantly affected by potential systematic effects, such as surface brightness selection, photometric errors, or redshift incompleteness.

The FIR luminosities of 555 massive star forming regions (MSFRs), 413 of which lie within the solar circle, are inferred from their fluxes in the four IRAS bands and from their kinematic distances, derived using the CS(2-1) velocity profiles.

astro-ph/9910280,astro-ph,"The frequency distribution of photons in frequency that results from single Compton scattering of monochromatic radiation on thermal electrons is derived in the mildly relativistic limit. Algebraic expressions are given for (1) the photon redistribution function, K(nu,Omega -> nu',Omega'), and (2) the spectrum produced in the case of isotropic incident radiation, P(nu -> nu'). The former is a good approximation for electron temperatures kTe < 25 keV and photon energies hnu < 50 keV, and the latter is applicable when hnu(hnu/mec2) < kTe < 25 keV, hnu < 50 keV. Both formulae can be used for describing the profiles of X-ray and low-frequency lines upon scattering in hot, optically thin plasmas, such as present in clusters of galaxies, in the coronae of accretion disks in X-ray binaries and AGNs, during supernova explosions, etc. Both formulae can also be employed as the kernels of the corresponding integral kinetic equations (direction-dependent and isotropic) in the general problem of Comptonization on thermal electrons. The K(nu,Omega -> nu',Omega') kernel, in particular, is applicable to the problem of induced Compton interaction of anisotropic low-frequency radiation of high brightness temperature with free electrons in the vicinity of powerful radiosources and masers. Fokker-Planck-type expansion (up to fourth order) of the integral kinetic equation with the P(nu -> nu') kernel derived here leads to a generalization of the Kompaneets equation.

The published spectral classifications of the dominant stars range from O7 to WN3, and morphologies range from Stromgren sphere to shell structure. Two of the objects include SNR contamination.

We also find evidence that this emission is anisotropic, which leads us to identify CCCs with the misoriented relativistic jet component which dominates in BL Lac objects. This interpretation is also supported by the similarity in the radio-to-optical and optical spectral indices.   The high rate of CCC detection (85 %) suggests that a `standard' pc scale, geometrically thick torus is not present in low luminosity radio-galaxies.

For a equation black hole, typical of FR I sources, these limits translate into a fraction as small as less than equation of the Eddington luminosity.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9908086,astro-ph,"We consider the physical implications of the rapid spindown of Soft Gamma Repeater 190014, and of the apparent ""braking glitch"", letter P/P = l x 10-4, that was concurrent with the Aug. 27th giant flare. A radiation-hydrodynamical outflow associated with the flare could impart the required torque, but only if the dipole magnetic field is stronger than ~ 1014 G and the outflow lasts longer and/or is more energetic than the observed X-ray flare. A positive period increment is also a natural consequence of a gradual, plastic deformation of the neutron star crust by an intense magnetic field, which forces the neutron superfluid to rotate more slowly than the crust. Sudden unpinning of the neutron vortex lines during the August 27th event would then induce a glitch opposite in sign to those observed in young pulsars, but of a much larger magnitude as a result of the slower rotation.   The change in the persistent X-ray lightcurve following the August 27 event is ascribed to continued particle heating in the active region of that outburst. The enhanced X-ray output can be powered by a steady current flowing through the magnetosphere, induced by the twisting motion of the crust. The long term rate of spindown appears to be accelerated with respect to a simple magnetic dipole torque. Accelerated spindown of a seismically-active magnetar will occur when its persistent output of Alfven waves and particles exceeds its spindown luminosity. We suggest that SGRs experience some episodes of relative inactivity, with diminished spindown rates, and that such inactive magnetars are observed as Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs). The rapid reappearence of persistent X-ray emission following August 27 flare gives evidence against accretion-powered models.",1999,[],5

astro-ph/9904246,astro-ph,"We study the possibility for a measurement of neutrino mass using weak gravitational lensing. The presence of non-zero mass neutrinos leads to a suppression of power at small scales and reduces the expected weak lensing signal. The measurement of such a suppression in the weak lensing power spectrum allows a direct measurement of the neutrino mass, in contrast to various other experiments which only allow mass splittings between two neutrino species. Making reasonable assumptions on the accuracy of cosmological parameters, we suggest that a weak lensing survey of 100 sqr. degrees can be easily used to detect neutrinos down to a mass limit of 3.5 eV at the 2 sigma level. This limit is lower than current limits on neutrino mass, such as from the Ly-alpha forest and SN1987A. An ultimate weak lensing survey of pi steradians down to a magnitude limit of 25 can be used to detect neutrinos down to a mass limit of 0.4 eV at the 2 sigma level, provided that other cosmological parameters will be known to an accuracy expected from cosmic microwave background spectrum using the MAP satellite. With improved parameters estimated from the PLANCK satellite, the limit on neutrino mass from weak lensing can be further lowered by another factor of 3 to 4. For much smaller surveys (10 sqr. degrees) that are likely to be first available in the near future with several wide-field cameras, the presence of neutrinos can be safely ignored when deriving conventional cosmological parameters such as the mass density of the Universe. However, armed with cosmological parameter estimates with other techniques, even such small area surveys allow a strong possibility to investigate the presence of non-zero mass neutrinos.",1999,[],5
astro-ph/9904118,astro-ph,"We estimate the power spectrum of mass density fluctuations from peculiar velocities of galaxies by applying an improved maximum-likelihood technique to the new all-sky SFI catalog. Parametric models are used for the power spectrum and the errors, and the free parameters are determined by assuming Gaussian velocity fields and errors and maximizing the probability of the data given the model. It has been applied to generalized CDM models with and without COBE normalization. The method has been carefully tested using artificial SFI catalogs. The most likely distance errors are found to be similar to the original error estimates in the SFI data. The general result that is not very sensitive to the prior model used is a relatively high amplitude of the power spectrum. For example, at k=0.1 h/Mpc we find P(k)letter1.2=(4.4/-1.7)X103 (Mpc/h)3. An integral over the power spectrum yields letter8letter0.6=0.82/-0.12. Model-dependent constraints on the cosmological parameters are obtained for families of CDM models. For example, for COBE-normalized letter CDM models (scalar fluctuations only), the maximum-likelihood result can be approximated by letter n2 h601.3 =0.58/-0.11. The formal random errors quoted correspond to the 90% confidence level. The total uncertainty, including systematic errors associated with nonlinear effects, may be larger by a factor of ~2.

The observed broad Lyman alpha absorption line is consistent with an interstellar column density of neutral hydrogen Nh=(4.0-1.0)e20 cm-2. The light curve obtained from the time-tagged dataset puts a 3sigma upper limit of 0.04mag on the ultraviolet variability of RXJ0439.8-6809 on time scales between 10s and 35min. The long-term X-ray light curve obtained from our three-year ROSAT HRI monitoring of RXJ0439.8-6809 shows the source with a constant count rate, and implies that the temperature did not change more than a few 1000K.

astro-ph/9911361,astro-ph,"The [O II] lambda3727 emission lines and absorption features from stellar Balmer and Ca H&K lines are the most accessible kinematic diagnotics in galaxies at z~1. We investigate the kinematics of 22 local late-type galaxies using these spectral features and we compare the results to 21-cm neutral hydrogen spectra in order to assess the utility of each diagnostic for measuring galaxy masses. In order to simulate data at high redshift where only 1-dimensional velocity profiles are normally available, we study spatially integrated as well as spatially-resolved spectra. Although the studied galaxies span a wide range of morphological types, inclinations, and star formation rates, we find that the gaseous and stellar kinematic tracers yield comparable kinematic line widths and systemic velocities. The [O II] and H I line widths correlate most strongly, showing an intrinsic dispersion of ~20 km/s, or ~10% for a typical galaxy with a kinematic width of 200 km/s. In a few extreme cases, the [O II] line widths underestimate the neutral hydrogen width by 50%. Reliable velocity widths can also be obtained from the stellar Balmer and Ca H&K absorption lines, even for some of the very late-type galaxies which have strong emission lines. The intrinsic dispersion is <10% between the stellar absorption and H I line widths. We provide a prescription for using these strong stellar absorption and [O II] emission features to measure the kinematics, and thus masses, of galaxies in the distant universe.",1999,[],5

The Stokes mode is easily produced by backward Raman scattering while the anti-Stokes mode is created by the interacting intersecting masers in the plasma. The intensity of the Stokes mode is higher than that of the anti-Stokes mode. These side band modes are proposed as explanation for the extreme velocity features observed in the galaxy NGC 4258.

Several trends noticed in emission-line investigations of diffuse gas in other galaxies are confirmed in the Milky Way and extended to much fainter emission. We find that the [S II]/H-Alpha and [N II]/H-Alpha ratios increase as absolute H-Alpha intensities decrease. For the more distant Perseus arm emission, the increase in these ratios is a strong function of Galactic latitude and thus, of height above the Galactic plane. The [S II]/[N II] ratio is relatively independent of H-Alpha intensity. Scatter in this ratio appears to be physically significant, and maps of it suggest regions with similar ratios are spatially correlated. The Perseus arm [S II]/[N II] ratio is systematically lower than Local emission by 10%-20%. With [S II]/[N II] fairly constant over a large range of H-Alpha intensities, the increase of [S II]/H-Alpha and [N II]/H-Alpha with z seems to reflect an increase in temperature. Such an interpretation allows us to estimate the temperature and ionization conditions in our large sample of observations. We find that WIM temperatures range from 6,000 K to 9,000 K with temperature increasing from bright to faint H-Alpha emission (low to high [S II]/H-Alpha and [N II]/H-Alpha) respectively. Changes in [S II]/[N II] appear to reflect changes in the local ionization conditions (e.g. the S/S ratio).

In this model each supernova sweeps up the surrounding interstellar gas into a dense shell and directly enriches it with ejecta which consist of heavy elements produced in each Type II supernova with different progenitor masses. We propose a two-component source for GCRs such that both interstellar gas and fresh SN ejecta engulfed in the shell are accelerated by the shock wave.

astro-ph/9911312,astro-ph,"We derive the theoretical distribution function of black hole masses by studying the formation processes of black holes. We use the results of recent 2D simulations of core-collapse to obtain the relation between remnant and progenitor masses and fold it with an initial mass function for the progenitors. We examine how the calculated black-hole mass distributions are modified by (i) strong wind mass loss at different evolutionary stages of the progenitors, and (ii) the presence of close binary companions to the black-hole progenitors. Thus, we are able to derive the binary black hole mass distribution. The compact remnant distribution is dominated by neutron stars in the mass range 1.2-1.6Msun and falls off exponentially at higher remnant masses. Our results are most sensitive to mass loss from winds which is even more important in close binaries. Wind mass-loss causes the black hole distribution to become flatter and limits the maximum possible black-hole mass (<10-15Msun). We also study the effects of the uncertainties in the explosion and unbinding energies for different progenitors. The distributions are continuous and extend over a broad range. We find no evidence for a gap at low values (3-5Msun) or for a peak at higher values (~7Msun) of black hole masses, but we argue that our black hole mass distribution for binaries is consistent with the current sample of measured black-hole masses in X-ray transients. We discuss possible biases against the detection or formation of X-ray transients with low-mass black holes.

Higher-ionization lines have larger peak-to-peak velocity separations.

On average, we find that a kick of 740 km/s is needed to account for the recently measured radial velocity of 430 km/s (Johnston, Fender & Wu) for this extreme system. The corresponding minimum kick velocity is 500 km/s. This is the largest kick needed to explain the motion of any observed binary system.

To avoid the problems related to bar classification in the RC3, e.g., subjectivity, low resolution and contamination by dust, we have developed an objective bar classification method, which we conservatively apply to our new sub-arcsecond resolution near-infrared imaging data set (Peletier et al. 1999). We are able to use stringent criteria based on radial profiles of ellipticity and major axis position angle to determine the presence of a bar and its axial ratio. Concentrating on non-interacting galaxies in our sample for which morphological information can be obtained, we find that Seyfert hosts are barred more often (79% /- 7.5%) than the non-active galaxies in our control sample (59% /- 9%), a result which is at the 2.5 sigma significance level. The fraction of non-axisymmetric hosts becomes even larger when interacting galaxies are taken into account. We discuss the implications of this result for the fueling of central activity by large-scale bars.

The final aim is to generalize the close limit approximation to the most general case of two rotating black holes in orbit around each other, and thus provide reliable templates for the gravitational waveforms in this regime. For this reason it has become very important to know if these predictions can actually be trusted to larger separation parameters (even in the region where the holes have distinct event horizons).

It accomodates quantum mechanical and wave mechanical processes in spacetime which in (Euclidean) optics correspond to wave processes in a 'Mach-Zehnder' interferometer: amplitude splitting, reflection, and interference. These processes are described in terms of amplitudes which behave smoothly across the event horizons of all four Rindler sectors. In this context there arises quite naturally a complete set of orthonormal wave packet histories, one of whose key properties is their ""explosivity index"". In the limit of low index values the wave packets trace out fuzzy world lines. By contrast, in the asymptotic limit of high index values, there are no world lines, not even fuzzy ones. Instead, the wave packet histories are those of entities with non-trivial internal collapse and explosion dynamics. Their details are described by the wave processes in the above-mentioned Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Each one of them is a double slit interference process.

Using a straightforward local analysis near the EH, we show that, generically, the 'ingoing' (equation) component of the perturbing field dies off along the EH more rapidly than its 'outgoing' (equation) counterpart. Thus, while along equation lines both components of the perturbation admit the well-known equation decay rate, one finds that along the EH the equation component dies off in advanced-time equation as equation, whereas the equation component dies off as equation. We then describe the extension of this analysis to a Kerr black hole. We conclude that for axially symmetric modes the situation is analogous to the Schwarzschild case.

In this stage, equilibrium sequences can be applied to evolution of compact binary star systems. Along the equilibrium sequences, there appear several critical states where some instability sets in or configuration changes drastically. We have discussed relations among these critical points and have stressed the importance of the mass overflow as well as the dynamical instability of orbital motions.

It is found that if one incorrectly uses the Schwarzschild geometry (to the relevant accuracy) to represent the nonstatic quasi-metric model, the largest errors result from the mismodelling of null paths. One consequence of this is that using electromagnetic signals to track the motion of a non-relativistic particle results in the illusion that the particle is influenced by an anomalous force of size cH (where H is the Hubble parameter) directed towards the observer.

We calculate the energy spectrum and the waveform of gravitational waves for axial modes. Since metric perturbations in axial modes do not couple to the matter fluid of the star, emitted waves for a normal neutron star show only one peak in the spectrum, which corresponds to the orbital frequency at the turning point, where the gravitational field is strongest. However, for an ultracompact star (the radius equation), another type of resonant periodic peak appears in the spectrum. This is just because of an excitation by a scattered particle of axial quasinormal modes, which were found by Chandrasekhar and Ferrari. This excitation comes from the existence of the potential minimum inside of a star. We also find for an ultracompact star many small periodic peaks at the frequency region beyond the maximum of the potential, which would be due to a resonance of two waves reflected by two potential barriers (Regge-Wheeler type and one at the center of the star). Such resonant peaks appear neither for a normal neutron star nor for a Schwarzschild black hole.

By and large, these programmes accept most of the ingredient theories' treatment of spacetime, albeit with a metric with some type of quantum nature; but they also suggest that the treatment has fundamental limitations. This prompts the idea of going further: either by quantizing structures other than the metric, such as the topology; or by regarding such structures as phenomenological. We discuss this in Section \refSec:TowardsQuST.",1999,[],4

In the present paper, we give a proof of this conjecture for rather general models. Recently, we also proposed the 'no-supercritical supercurvature mode conjecture' that claims the absence of supercritical supercurvature modes in the one-bubble open inflation model.

The information known about the possible sources is used to construct a model of the expected waveforms (templates).

We regard as a maximum extension beyond the event horizon of that spacetime its embedding in a three-dimensional Minkowskian space with the topology of the corresponding Misner space. It is obtained that the interior of the spaceship bubble becomes then a multiply connected nonchronal region with closed timelike curves and that the most natural vacuum allows quantum fluctuations which do not induce any divergent behaviour of the re-normalized stress-energy tensor, even on the event (Cauchy) chronology horizon. In such a case, the horizon encloses closed timelike curves only at scales close to the Planck length, so that the warp drive satisfies the Ford's negative energy-time inequality. Also found is a connection between the superluminal two-dimensional warp drive space and two-dimensional gravitational kinks.

We propose a microlocal version of the Hadamard condition for spinor fields on arbitrary spacetimes, which is shown to entail the usual short distance behaviour of the twopoint function. The polarisation set of these twopoint functions is determined from the Dencker connection of the spinorial Klein-Gordon operator which we show to equal the (pull-back) of the spin connection. Finally it is demonstrated that adiabatic states of infinite order are Hadamard, and that those of order equation correspond, in some sense, to a truncated Hadamard series and will therefore allow for a point splitting renormalisation of the expected stress-energy tensor.",1999,[],4

We study the coframe teleparallel theory of gravity with a most general quadratic Lagrangian. The coframe field on a differentiable manifold is a basic dynamical variable. A metric tensor as well as a metric compatible connection is generated by a coframe in a unique manner. The Lagrangian is a general linear combination of Weitzenbock's quadratic invariants with free dimensionless parameters equation.   Every independent term of the Lagrangian is a global SO(1,3)-invariant 4-form. For a special choice of parameters which confirms with the local SO(1,3) invariance this theory gives an alternative description of Einsteinian gravity - teleparallel equivalent of GR.   We prove that the sign of the scalar curvature of a metric generated by a static spherical-symmetric solution depends only on a relation between the free parameters. The scalar curvature vanishes only for a subclass of models with equation. This subclass includes the teleparallel equivalent of GR. We obtain the explicit form of all spherically symmetric static solutions of the 'diagonal' type to the field equations for an arbitrary choice of free parameters. We prove that the unique asymptotic-flat solution with Newtonian limit is the Schwarzschild solution that holds for a subclass of teleparallel models with equation.

It is well known that an accelerating observer will experience a bath of radiation resulting from the quantum vacuum which mimics that of a heat bath, the so-called Davies-Unruh effect. We have further analyzed this problem of an accelerated object moving through the vacuum and have shown that the zero-point field will yield a non-zero Poynting vector to an accelerating observer. Scattering of this radiation by the quarks and electrons constituting matter would result in an acceleration-dependent reaction force that would appear to be the origin of inertia of matter (Rueda and Haisch 1998a, 1998b). In the subrelativistic case this inertia reaction force is exactly newtonian and in the relativistic case it exactly reproduces the well known relativistic extension of Newton's Law. This analysis demonstrates then that both the ordinary, F=ma, and the relativistic forms of Newton's equation of motion may be derived from Maxwell's equations as applied to the electromagnetic zero-point field. We expect to be able to extend this analysis in the future to more general versions of the quantum vacuum than just the electromagnetic one discussed herein.",1999,[],4

We attempt to compute this radiation by treating the geometry for a single boosted conformally flat hole as a perturbation of a Schwarzschild black hole, which requires the use of second order perturbation theory. In this we attempt to mimic a previous calculation we did for the conformally flat initial data for spinning holes. We find that the boosted black hole case presents additional subtleties, and although one can evolve perturbatively and compute radiated energies, it is much less clear than in the spinning case how useful for the study of collisions are the radiation estimates for the 'spurious energy' in each hole. In addition to this we draw some lessons on which frame of reference appears as more favorable for computing black hole collisions in the close limit approximation.",1999,[],4

It is emphasized that Eddington did not monitor the entire Tolman energy integral, concentrating solely upon the change of the 'kinetic' part of the energy . The 'quadrupole formula' is thus seen to measure the kinetic energy change. When the derivative of the missing stress-trace integral is computed, it is seen to cancel the Eddington term and hence the energy of the rod is conserved, in support of the localization hypothesis.

It is also found that the Majumdar condition can hold for a bounded perfect fluid only if the matter pressure vanishes (that is, charged dust). By restricting to spherically symmetric distributions of charged matter, a number of exact solutions are presented in closed form which generalise the Schwarzschild interior solution. Some of these solutions exhibit functional relations between the electric and gravitational potentials different to the quadratic one of Weyl. All the non-dust solutions are well-behaved and, by matching them to the Reissner-Nordstrom solution, all of the constants of integration are identified in terms of the total mass, total charge and radius of the source.

The equations of motion are recast into the ""flat space - uniform time"" form, and compared with the geodesic equations of motion. The principles of the post-Newtonian approximation of this theory are given, including the way to account for preferred-frame effects. This approximation is then developed more particularly for photons. It is found that the preferred-frame effects do not occur in this case, nor does the difference between Newton's second law and geodesic assumption.

In this paper, we derive simple, testable criteria for the MSE to be strongly elliptic, thereby guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the Dirichlet boundary value problem. We show that these criteria are satisfied in a test-bed metric for inspiraling binaries, and we argue that they should be satisfied quite generally for inspiraling binaries. If the local existence and uniqueness that we have proved holds globally, then, for appropriate boundary values, the solution of the MSE exhibited by Brady et. al.

This calculation is essentially an application of the steepest-descent method to evaluate integrals. Second, we numerically compare the stationary-phase expression to the results obtained by Fast Fourier Transform. We show that the differences can be fully attributed to the windowing of the time series, and that they have nothing to do with an intrinsic failure of the stationary-phase method.

In flat space-time the Klein-Gordon equation equation has the non-static spherically symmetric solution equation, where equation is a once differentiable function of the null coordinate equation. In particular the function equation can be taken to be initially zero and then grow, thus producing a singularity in the scalar field. A similar situation occurs when the scalar field is coupled to gravity via Einstein's equations; the solution also develops a divergent Kretschmann invariant singularity, but it has no overall energy. To overcome this Bekenstein's theorems are applied to give two corresponding conformally coupled solutions. One of these has positive ADM mass and has the properties: i) it develops a Kretschmann invariant singularity, ii)it has no event horizon, iii)it has a well-defined source, iv)it has well-defined junction condition to Minkowski space-time, v)it is asymptotically flat with positive overall energy.

As an average proper velocity of light is implicitly used in the Shapiro time delay (as shown in the Appendix) it is explicitly derived and it is shown that for a round trip of a light signal between two points in a gravitational field the Shapiro time delay not only depends on which point it is measured at, but in the case of a parallel gravitational field it is not always a delay effect. The propagation of light in rotating frames (the Sagnac effect) is also discussed and an expression for the coordinate velocity of light is derived. The use of this coordinate velocity naturally explains why an observer on a rotating disk finds that two light signals emitted from a point on the rim of the disk and propagating in opposite directions along the rim do not arrive simultaneously at the same point.",1999,[],4

It is argued, in the spirit of the free fall type universality, that the preferred quantum field vacua with respect to accelerated worldlines should be chosen in the class of all those possessing stationary spectra for their quantum fluctuations. For scalar quantum field vacua there are six stationary cases as shown by Letaw some time ago, these are reviewed here. However, the non-stationary vacuum noises are not out of reach and can be processed by a few mathematical methods that are mentioned as well.

The field variables in the central y=0 grid plane can be updated using normal (x,y,z)--coordinate finite differencing, while those in the y \neq 0 grid planes can be computed from those in the central plane by using the axisymmetry assumption and interpolation.

Quantum gravitational fluctuations may induce a minimum length thus introducing an additional source of uncertainty in physics. The existence of this resolution limit casts doubts on the metric structure of spacetime at the Planck scale and opens a doorway to nontrivial topologies, which may dominate Planck scale physics. This foamlike structure of spacetime may show up in low-energy physics through loss of quantum coherence and mode-dependent energy shifts, for instance, which might be observable. Spacetime foam introduces nonlocal interactions that can be modeled by a quantum bath, and low-energy fields evolve according to a master equation that displays such effects.

We find an empirical model able to represent coherently all the non-harmonic lines we have found in the power spectrum, in terms of an assumed reference signal of the primary supply input signal. If this signal is not available then it can be reconstructed from the same data by making use of the coherent line removal algorithm that we have described elsewhere. All these lines are broadened by frequency changes of the supply signal, and they corrupt significant frequency ranges of the power spectrum. The physical process that generates this interference is so far unknown, but it is highly non-linear and non-stationary.

We discuss the numerical time-evolution of a given black-hole-containing initial data slice in spherical symmetry. We avoid singularities via the ""black-hole exclusion"" or ""horizon boundary condition"" technique, where the slices meet the black hole's singularity, but on each slice a spatial neighbourhood of the singularity is excluded from the domain of the numerical computations.   After first discussing some of the key design choices which arise with the black hole exclusion technique, we then give a detailed description of our numerical evolution scheme for spherically symmetric scalar field evolution, assuming that a black hole is already present on the initial slice. We use a free evolution, with Eddington-Finkelstein-like coordinates and the inner boundary placed at a fixed coordinate radius well inside the horizon.   Our numerical scheme is based on the method of lines (MOL), where spacetime PDEs are first finite differenced in space only, yielding a system of coupled ODEs for the time evolution of the field variables along the spatial-grid-point world lines. These ODEs are then time-integrated by standard methods. We use 4th order finite differencing in both space and time, with 5 and/or 6 point spatial molecules (off-centered near the grid boundaries), and a Runge-Kutta time integrator. The spatial grid is smoothly nonuniform, but not adaptive.

gr-qc/9911099,gr-qc,"There are two effects of extra matter fields on the Lorentzian traversable wormhole. The 'primary effect' says that the extra matter can afford to be a part of source or whole source of the wormhole when the wormhole is being formed. Thus the matter does not affect the stability of wormhole and the wormhole is still safe. If the extra matter is extotic, it can be the whole part of the source of the wormhole.   The 'auxiliary effect' is that the extra matter plays the role of the additional matter to the stably-existed wormhole by the other exotic matter. This additional matter will change the geometry of wormhole enough to prevent from forming the wormhole by backreaction. In the minimally coupled massless scalar field case, the self-consistent solution was found. The backreaction of the scalar field can dominate the exotic matter part so that it will hinder the formation of the wormhole.",1999,[],4

We find that the charge limit decreases with increasing central boson density. We discuss the gravitational evolution of charged and uncharged boson stars in a cosmological setting and show how, at any point in its evolution, the physical properties of the star may be calculated by a rescaling of a solution whose asymptotic value of the scalar field is equal to its initial asymptotic value. We focus on evolution in which the particle number of the star is conserved and we find that the energy and central density of the star decreases as the cosmological time increases.

This aberration is qualitatively similar to that caused by special relativity. Behind the starship, a conical region forms from within which no signal can reach the starship, an effective 'horizon'. Conversely, there is also an horizon-like structure in a conical region in front of the starship, into which the starship cannot send a signal. These causal structures are somewhat analogous to the Mach cones associated with supersonic fluid flow.

Here we explore pseudospectral collocation (PSC) as an alternative to finite differencing, focusing particularly on the solution of the Hamiltonian constraint (an elliptic partial differential equation) for a black hole spacetime with angular momentum and for a black hole spacetime superposed with gravitational radiation. In PSC, an approximate solution, generally expressed as a sum over a set of orthogonal basis functions (e.g., Chebyshev polynomials), is substituted into the exact system of equations and the residual minimized. For systems with analytic solutions the approximate solutions converge upon the exact solution exponentially as the number of basis functions is increased. Consequently, PSC has a high computational efficiency: for solutions of even modest accuracy we find that PSC is substantially more efficient, as measured by either execution time or memory required, than finite differencing; furthermore, these savings increase rapidly with increasing accuracy. The solution provided by PSC is an analytic function given everywhere; consequently, no interpolation operators need to be defined to determine the function values at intermediate points and no special arrangements need to be made to evaluate the solution or its derivatives on the boundaries. Since the practice of numerical relativity by finite differencing has been, and continues to be, hampered by both high computational resource demands and the difficulty of formulating acceptable finite difference alternatives to the analytic boundary conditions, PSC should be further pursued as an alternative way of formulating the computational problem of finding numerical solutions to the field equations of general relativity.",1999,[],4

In such a frame, the Poynting vector and momentum flux of the ZPF become non-zero. If one assumes that scattering of the ZPF radiation takes place at the level of quarks and electrons constituting matter, then it is possible for both Newton's equation of motion, equation, and its relativistic covariant generalization, equation, to be obtained as a consequence of the non-zero ZPF momentum flux. We now conjecture that this scattering must take place at the Compton frequency of a particle, and that this interpretation of mass leads directly to the de Broglie relation characterizing the wave nature of that particle in motion, equation.

After a covariant gauge fixing, the dynamics is unique and the background manifold points are well-defined, but the description remains invariant with respect to all diffeomorphisms of the background manifold. Transformations between different covariant gauge fixings form the well-known Bergmann-Komar group. Each covariant gauge fixing determines a so-called Kucha\vr decomposition.

gr-qc/9907006,gr-qc,"Inspiraling compact binaries have been identified as one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves for interferometric detectors. Most of these binaries are expected to have circularized by the time their gravitational waves enter the instrument's frequency band. However, the possibility that some of the binaries might still possess a significant eccentricity is not excluded. We imagine a situation in which eccentric signals are received by the detector but not explicitly searched for in the data analysis, which uses exclusively circular waveforms as matched filters. We ascertain the likelihood that these filters, though not optimal, will nevertheless be successful at capturing the eccentric signals. We do this by computing the loss in signal-to-noise ratio incurred when searching for eccentric signals with those nonoptimal filters. We show that for a binary system of a given total mass, this loss increases with increasing eccentricity. We show also that for a given eccentricity, the loss decreases as the total mass is increased.",1999,[],4

These lecture notes emphasize those aspects that are most relevant to the questions that come to mind when one is exposed for the first time to these research developments: How come theory and experiments are finally meeting in spite of all the gloomy forecasts that pervade traditional reviews? Is this a case of theorists having put forward more and more speculative ideas until a point was reached at which conventional experiments could rule out the proposed phenomena? Or has there been such a remarkable improvement in experimental techniques and ideas that we are now capable of testing plausible candidate quantum-gravity phenomena? These questions are analysed rather carefully for the recent proposals of interferometry-based tests and tests using observations of gamma rays of astrophysical origin. I also briefly discuss other proposed experiments (including tests of quantum-gravity-induced decoherence using the neutral-kaon system and accelerator tests of models with large extra dimensions). The emerging picture suggests that we are finally starting the exploration of a large class of plausible quantum-gravity effects.

We perform a numerical simulation of spherically symmetric black hole formation in the radiation-dominated, spatially flat background universe for a realistic initial condition supplied from the analytic solution. It is found that the initial metric perturbation has to be non-linear (the maximum value of 3D conformal factor equation at equation should be larger than equation) for a black hole to be formed, but the threshold amplitude for black hole formation and the final black hole mass considerably depend on the initial density (or metric) profile of the perturbation: The threshold value of equation at equation for formation of a black hole is smaller for a high density peak surrounded by a low density region than for that surrounded by the average density region of the flat universe.

gr-qc/9907042,gr-qc,"Investigations of classical signature change have generally envisaged applications to cosmological models, usually a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker model. The purpose has been to avoid the inevitable singularity of models with purely Lorentzian signature, replacing the neighbourhood of the big bang with an initial, singularity free region of Euclidean signture, and a signature change. We here show that signature change can also avoid the singularity of gravitational collapse. We investigate the process of re-birth of Schwarzschild type black holes, modelling it as a double signature change, joining two universes of Lorentzian signature through a Euclidean region which provides a `bounce'. We show that this process is viable both with and without matter present, but realistic models -- which have the signature change surfaces hidden inside the horizons -- require non-zero density. In fact the most realistic models are those that start as a finite cloud of collapsing matter, surrounded by vacuum. We consider how geodesics may be matched across a signature change surface, and conclude that the particle `masses' must jump in value.

At these closer orbits significant compression and even collapse is still possible prior to merger for a sufficiently soft EOS. The reduced compression in the corrected simulation is consistent with other recent studies of rigid irrotational binaries in quasiequilibrium in which the compression effect is observed to be small.

gr-qc/9905058,gr-qc,"We have carried out simulations of the coalescence between two relativistic clusters of collisionless particles using a 3D numerical relativity code. We have adopted a new spatial gauge condition obtained by slightly modifying the minimum distortion gauge condition proposed by Smarr and York and resulting in a simpler equation for the shift vector. Using this gauge condition, we have performed several simulations of the merger between two identical clusters in which we have varied the compaction, the type of internal motion in the clusters, and the magnitude of the orbital velocity. As a result of the coalescence, either a new rotating cluster or a black hole is formed. In the case in which a black hole is not formed, simulations could be carried out for a time much longer than the dynamical time scale, and the resulting gravitational waveforms were calculated fairly accurately: In these cases, the amplitude of gravitational waves emitted can be equation at a distance 4000Mpc, and equation of the rest mass energy may be dissipated by the gravitational wave emission in the final phase of the merger. These results confirm that the new spatial gauge condition is promising in many problems at least up to the formation of black holes. In the case in which a black hole is formed, on the other hand, the gauge condition seems to be less adequate, but we suggest a strategy to improve it in this case.

The existence of such a bound is intriguing because it occurs well before the appearance of an apparent horizon at m = R/2. However, the assumptions made are extremely restrictive. They do not hold in a humble soap bubble and they certainly do not approximate any known topologically stable field configuration. We show that the 8/9 bound is robust by relaxing these assumptions. If the density is monotonically decreasing and the tangential stress is less than or equal to the radial stress we show that the 8/9 bound continues to hold through the entire bulk if m is replaced by the quasi-local mass. If the tangential stress exceeds the radial stress and/or the density is not monotonic we cannot recover the 8/9 bound.

In the second part, we focus on the main differential properties of the principal directions, studying when they are geodesic, and in that case we compute their associated optical scalars. With this information we get the conditions that a principal direction of the Papapetrou field must satisfy in order to be aligned with a multiple principal direction of the Weyl tensor in the case of algebraically special vacuum space-times. Finally, we illustrate this study using the Kerr, Kasner and pp waves space-times.",1999,[],4
gr-qc/9907032,gr-qc,"We study quantum mechanically the self-similar black hole formation by collapsing scalar field and find the wave functions that give the correct semiclassical limit. In contrast to classical theory, the wave functions for the black hole formation even in the supercritical case have not only incoming flux but also outgoing flux. From this result we compute the rate for the black hole formation. In the subcritical case our result agrees with the semiclassical tunneling rate. Furthermore, we show how to recover the classical evolution of black hole formation from the wave function by defining the Hamilton-Jacobi characteristic function as equation. We find that the quantum corrected apparent horizon deviates from the classical value only slightly without any qualitative change even in the critical case.",1999,[],4
gr-qc/9903020,gr-qc,"By using the Bondi-Sachs-van der Burg formalism we analyze the asymptotic properties at null infinity of axisymmetric electrovacuum spacetimes with a translational Killing vector and, in general, an infinite 'cosmic string' (represented by a conical singularity) along the axis. Such spacetimes admit only a local null infinity. There is a non-vanishing news function due to the existence of the string even though there is no radiation.   We prove that if null infinity has a smooth compact cross section and the spacetime is not flat in a neighbourhood of null infinity, then the translational Killing vector must be timelike and the spacetime is stationary. The other case in which an additional symmetry of axisymmetric spacetimes admits compact cross sections of null infinity is the boost symmetry, which leads to radiative spacetimes representing 'uniformly accelerated objects'. These cases were analyzed in detail in our previous works. If the translational Killing vector is spacelike or null, corresponding to cylindrical or plane waves, some complete generators of null infinity are 'singular' but null infinity itself can be smooth apart from these generators.   As two explicit examples of local null infinity, Schwarzschild spacetime with a string and a class of cylindrical waves with a string are discussed in detail in the Appendix.",1999,[],4

gr-qc/9908064,gr-qc,"The aim of this paper is to discuss a kinematical algebraic structure of a theory of gravity, that would be unitary, renormalizable and coupled in the same manner to both spinorial and tensorial matter fields. An analysis of the common features as well as differences of the Yang-Mills theories and gauge theories of gravity is carried out. In particular, we consider the following issues: (i) Representations of the relevant global symmetry on states and on fields, (ii) Relations between the relevant global and local symmetries, (iii) Representations of the local symmetries on states and fields, (iv) Dimensional analysis of the gauge algebra generators and the number of counter terms, and (v) Coupling to the spinorial matter fields. We conclude, that various difficulties on the gravity side can be overcome by considering the below outlined Hypergravity gauge theory, that to some extend parallels the string/membrane theories. This theory is based on an infinite Lie algebraic structure of generators that transforms as ""states"" of the infinite-dimensional irreducible representation of the equation subgroup of the Group of General Coordinate Transformations of R4.

gr-qc/9901026,gr-qc,In this talk I introduce the critical behavior occurring at the extremal limit of black holes. The extremal limit of black holes is a critical point and a phase transition takes place from the extremal black holes to their nonextremal counterparts. Some critical exponents satisfying the scaling laws are obtained. From the scaling laws we introduce the concept of the effective dimension of black holes and discuss the relationship between the critical behavior and the statistical interpretation of black hole entropy.,1999,[],4

Through a conformal transformation we can recast the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in an integrable form, which corresponds to the minimal coupling case, whose general solution is known. Performing the inverse conformal transformation in the solution so found, we can construct the corresponding one in the original frame. This procedure can also be employed with the bohmian trajectories. In this way, we can study the classical limit of some solutions of this quantum model.

gr-qc/9909038,gr-qc,"The purpose of the paper is to develop further a projection variational approach in relativistic hydrodynamics. The approach, previously proposed in [gr-qc/9908032], is based on the variation of the vector field and the projection tensor (instead of the given metric tensor) and their first partial derivatives. The previously proved property of non-commutativity of the variation and the partial derivative in respect to the projection tensor has been used to find all the variations. Subsequently, motivated by some analogy with the well-known (31) ADM projection formalism, an assumption has been made about a zero-covariant derivative of the projection tensor in respect to the projection connection. The combination of the equations for the variations of the projective tensor with covariant and contravariant indices has lead to the derivation of an important and concisely written relation: the derivative of the vector field length is equal to the 'twice' projected along the vector field initial Christoffell connection. The result is of interest due to the following reasons: 1. It is a more general one and contains in itself a well-known formulae in affine differential geometry for the so called equiaffine connections (admitting covariantly conserved tensor fields), for which the trace of the connection is equal to the gradient of the logarithm of the vector field length. 2. The additional term is the projected (with the projection tensor) initially given connection and accounts for the influence of the reference system on the change of the vector field's length, measured in this system. 3. The formulae has been obtained within the proposed formalism of non-commuting variation and partial derivative.",1999,[],4

gr-qc/9901032,gr-qc,"In a gedanken experiment in which a box initially containing energy equation and entropy equation is lowered toward a black hole and then dropped in, it was shown by Unruh and Wald that the generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics holds, without the need to assume any bounds on equation other than the bound that arises from the fact that entropy at a given energy and volume is bounded by that of unconstrained thermal matter. The original analysis by Unruh and Wald made the approximation that the box was 'thin', but they later generalized their analysis to thick boxes (in the context of a slightly different process). Nevertheless, Bekenstein has argued that, for a certain class of thick boxes, the buoyancy force of the 'thermal atmosphere' of the black hole is negligible, and that his previously postulated bound on equation is necessary for the validity of the generalized second law. In arguing for these conclusions, Bekenstein made some assumptions about the nature of unconstrained thermal matter and the location of the 'floating point' of the box. We show here that under these assumptions, Bekenstein's bound on equation follows automatically from the fact that equation is bounded by the entropy of unconstrained thermal matter. Thus, a box of matter which violates Bekenstein's bound would violate the assumptions made in his analysis, rather than violate the generalized second law. Indeed, we prove here that no universal entropy bound need be hypothesized in order to ensure the validity of the generalized second law in this process.",1999,[],4

gr-qc/9906110,gr-qc,"The study of the properties and dynamics of self-gravitating bosonic objects in Einstein gravity was conducted. We studied self-coupled boson stars and determined the quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies of stable boson stars in spherical symmetry. The study was carried out in the standard Einstein theory of General Relativity and in Brans-Dicke theory. We also studied the formation of these objects in Brans-Dicke theory showing that they can form from the self-gravitation of bosonic matter. We also studied the studied the possibility of a bosonic halo surrounding galaxies.   After an extensive study in spherical symmetry we carried out numerical studies of boson star dynamics in full 31 dimension. One focus of the 3D study was on the validation of the numerical code constructed to solve Einstein equations with matter sources. Boson Stars do not suffer from the surface problems of neutron stars or the singularities of black holes. The code was first tested with spherical perturbations and compared with the spherical results. We determined the coordinate conditions needed to provide stable evolutions. We then went on to study their behavior under non-spherical perturbations. We reproduced the QNM frequencies of the stars, as determined by perturbation studies carried out by other groups. The energy generated by the perturbation was studied with different radiation indicators. We also observed the collapse to black holes of unstable boson-star configurations.

This problem can't be solved in terms of the current quantum field theory which operates with Higgs and non-perturbative vacuum condensates and takes into account the changes of these condensates during relativistic phase transitions. The problem can't be completely solved also in terms of the conventional global quantum theory: Wheeler-DeWitt quantum geometrodynamics does not describe the evolution of the Universe in time (RPT in particular). We have investigated this problem in the context of energies density of different vacuum subsystems characteristic scales of which pervaid all energetic scale of the Universe. At first the phemenological solution of Lambda-term problem and then the hypothesis about the possible structure of a new global quantum theory are proposed. The main feature of this theory is the inreversible evolution of geometry and vacuum condensates in time in the regime of their selforganization.

gr-qc/9909005,gr-qc,"The 'close limit,' a method based on perturbations of Schwarzschild spacetime, has proved to be a very useful tool for finding approximate solutions to models of black hole collisions.

Those second order calculations have been carried out in a fixed coordinate gauge, a method that entails conceptual and computational difficulties. Here we demonstrate a gauge invariant approach to such calculations. For a specific set of models (requiring head on collisions and quadrupole dominance of both the first and second order perturbations), we give a self contained gauge invariant formalism. Specifically, we give (i) wave equations and sources for first and second order gauge invariant wave functions; (ii) the prescription for finding Cauchy data for those equations from initial values of the first and second fundamental forms on an initial hypersurface; (iii) the formula for computing the gravitational wave power from the evolved first and second order wave functions.",1999,[],4

After studying the analytic properties of the action in the space of complex edge lengths we determine its classical extrema.   We then obtain steepest descents contours of constant imaginary action passing through Lorentzian classical geometries yielding a convergent wavefunction of the universe, dominated by the contributions coming from these extrema. By considering these contours we justify semiclassical approximations based on those classical solutions, clearly predicting classical spacetime in the late universe.

The known solutions are numerical in time domain or approximate and asymptotic for low or high frequencies in Fourier domain. The former is of scarce relevance for comprehension of the geodesic equations for a body in the black hole field, while the latter is mainly useful for the description of the emitted gravitational radiation.

gr-qc/9906054,gr-qc,"Grishchuk has shown that the stochastic background of gravitational waves produced by an inflationary phase in the early Universe has an unusual property: it is not a stationary Gaussian random process. Due to squeezing, the phases of the different waves are correlated in a deterministic way, arising from the process of parametric amplification that created them. The resulting random process is Gaussian but non-stationary. This provides a unique signature that could in principle distinguish a background created by inflation from stationary stochastic backgrounds created by other types of processes. We address the question: could this signature be observed with a gravitational wave detector? Sadly, the answer appears to be ""no"": an experiment which could distinguish the non-stationary behavior would have to last approximately the age of the Universe at the time of measurement. This rules out direct detection by ground and space based gravitational wave detectors, but not indirect detections via the electromagnetic Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR).",1999,[],4

gr-qc/9908079,gr-qc,We study the stability properties of the standard ADM formulation of the 31 evolution equations of general relativity through linear perturbations of flat spacetime. We focus attention on modes with zero speed of propagation and conjecture that they are responsible for instabilities encountered in numerical evolutions of the ADM formulation. These zero speed modes are of two kinds: pure gauge modes and constraint violating modes. We show how the decoupling of the gauge by a conformal rescaling can eliminate the problem with the gauge modes. The zero speed constraint violating modes can be dealt with by using the momentum constraints to give them a finite speed of propagation. This analysis sheds some light on the question of why some recent reformulations of the 31 evolution equations have better stability properties than the standard ADM formulation.,1999,[],4

In order to investigate the relation between the vacuum stress and bremsstrahlung, we estimate the stress-energy tensor of the electromagnetic field generated by a point charge, at the position of the charge. We use the retarded field as a self-field of the point charge. Therefore the tensor diverges if we evaluate it as it is. Hence we remove the divergent contributions by using the expansion of the tensor in powers of the distance from the point charge.

We further assume that, at any given point, light propagates isotropically solely in the minimal-velocity local frame existing at the point. We obtain the following results: (i) After showing the compatibility of the gravitational field eqs. with our assumptions, we find the functional dependance of the minimal velocity on the distance to and mass of a single large body.

We identified the base-space with the space-time of two models of universe: the Robertson-Walker - like model and the Schwarzschild - like model. With this ansatz, we followed an algorithm that permits to express the magnetic field in terms of the gauge potential Aa and the scalar field F.

We find regularized operators to represent the metric and discuss whether the coherent states of the quantum theory are peaked around classical spacetimes. It is shown that, although the expectation value of the metric on Killing orbits coincides with a classical solution, its relative fluctuations become significant when one approaches a region where null geodesics are focused.

Their previous analysis showed that the effects of acceleration radiation prevent violation of the generalized second law of thermodynamics. In our more generic case, we show that the properties of the thermal atmosphere are equally important when charge is present. Indeed, we prove here that an equilibrium condition for the the thermal atmosphere and the physical properties of ordinary matter are sufficient to enforce the generalized second law.

The resulting formalism can be used to study spacetimes containing electric or magnetic charge but not both, a restriction inherent in the formalism. The gauge dependence of the quasilocal energy is discussed. We use the thin shell formalism of Israel to reinterpret the quasilocal energy from an operational point of view and examine the implications for the recently proposed AdS/CFT inspired intrinsic reference terms. The distribution of energy around Reissner-Nordstrom and naked black holes is investigated as measured by both static and infalling observers.

The signals correspond to binaries with total masses between equation to equation and with (optimal filter) signal-to-noise ratios of 7 to 12. The method is implementable in real time, and achieves a coincident false alarm rate for two detectors equation 1 per 475 years. At this false alarm rate, the single detector false dismissal rate for our signal model is as low as 5.3% at an SNR of 10. We expect to obtain similar or better detection rates with this method for any signal of similar power that satisfies certain adiabaticity criteria.

gr-qc/9903073,gr-qc,"An estimate for the classical action for a Bianchi VIh homogeneous spatially closed cosmology is presented as a function of b, a parameter of the model that is proportional to the relative rotation of the average inertial frame and the bulk of matter in the universe. It is assumed (through the equation of state) that a relativistic early universe is followed by a matter-dominated late universe. The action is used in a saddlepoint approximation to a semiclassical estimate for the wave function in quantum cosmology to explain why our inertial frame seems not to rotate relative to the stars. The saddlepoint is at b=0, as would be expected. Application of the saddlepoint approximation leads to the result that only those classical geometries whose action differs from the saddlepoint value for the action by an amount less than Planck's constant contribute significantly to the integration to give the present value of the wave function. Using estimates for our universe implies that only those classical geometries for which the present relative rotation rate of inertial frames and matter are less than about 10(-130) radians per year contribute significantly to the integration. This is well below the limit set by experiment. The result depends on the ratio of the Hubble distance to the Planck length, but does not depend on the details of the theory of quantum gravity.",1999,[],4

It is shown that in the Kerr background without horizon but with an inner boundary a scalar field has complex-frequency modes and that, however, the imaginary part of the complex frequency can be small enough compared with the Hawking temperature if the inner boundary is sufficiently close to the horizon, say at a proper altitude of Planck scale.

Since one of the major motivations to arrange for this meeting was that it should serve as a beginner's introduction to canonical quantum gravity, we regard it as important to demonstrate the usefulness of the formalism by means of applying it to simplified models of quantum gravity, here formulated in terms of Ashtekar's new variables. From the various, completely solvable, models that have been discussed in the literature we choose those that we consider as most suitable for our pedagogical reasons, namely 21 gravity and the spherically symmetric model. The former model arises from a dimensional, the latter from a Killing reduction of full 31 gravity. While 21 gravity is usually treated in terms of closed topologies without boundary of the initial data hypersurface, the toplogy for the spherically symmetric system is chosen to be asymptotically flat. Finally, 21 gravity is more suitably quantized using the loop representation while spherically symmetric gravity is easier to quantize via the self-dual representation. Accordingly, both types of reductions, both types of topologies and both types of representations that are mainly employed in the literature in the context of the new variables come into practice. What makes the discussion especially clear is the fact that for both models the reduced phase space turns out to be finitely dimensional.",1999,[],4

gr-qc/9905007,gr-qc,"Recently Bekenstein and Mayo conjectured an entropy bound for charged rotating objects. On the basis of the No-Hair principle for black holes, they speculate that this bound cannot be improved generically based on knowledge of other 'quantum numbers', e.g. baryon number, which may be borne by the object. Here we take a first step in the proof of this conjecture. The proof make use of a gedanken experiment in which a massive object endowed with a scalar charge is lowered adiabatically towards a Schwarzschild's black hole and than dropped into the black hole from some proper distance above the horizon. Central to the proof is the intriguing fact that the self-energy of the particle receives no contribution from the scalar charge. Thus the energy with which the object is assimilated consists of its gravitational energy alone. This of course agrees with the No-scalar-Hair principle for black holes: after the object is assimilated into the black hole, any knowledge of the scalar field properties is lost. Using the GSL, we reach the conclusion that the original entropy bound was not improved by the knowledge of the scalar charge. At the end we speculate on whether or not massive vector fields may serve in the tightening of the entropy bound.",1999,[],4
gr-qc/9904076,gr-qc,"The Hawking radiation is one of the most interesting phenomena predicted by the theory of quantum field in curved space. The origin of Hawking radiation is closely related to the fact that a particle which marginally escapes from collapsing into a black hole is observed at the future infinity with infinitely large redshift. In other words, such a particle had a very high frequency when it was near the event horizon. Motivated by the possibility that the property of Hawking radiation may be altered by some unknowned physics which may exist beyond some critical scale, Unruh proposed a model which has higher order spatial derivative terms. In his model, the effects of unknown physics are modeled so as to be suppressed for the waves with a wavelength much longer than the critical scale, equation. Surprisingly, it was shown that the thermal spectrum is recovered for such modified models. To introduce such higher order spatial derivative terms, the Lorentz invariance must be violated because one special spatial direction needs to be chosen. In previous works, the rest frame of freely-falling observers was employed as this special reference frame. Here we give an extension by allowing a more general choice of the reference frame. Developing the method taken by Corley, % and especially focusing on subluminal case, we show that the resulting spectrum of created particles again becomes the thermal one at the Hawking temperature even if the choice of the reference frame is generalized.

A similar conservation theorem can be proven for linearized gravitational fields off of a stationary, asymptotically flat background, with the second order Einstein tensor playing the role of an effective stress-energy tensor of the linearized field. In this paper, we prove the above theorems for smooth sources and then investigate the extent to which they continue to hold for point particle sources.

In the zero temperature limit, such condensates are describable at a mesoscopic level by irrotational configurations of simple relativistic perfect fluid models. The general mechanical properties of such models are presented here in an introductory review giving special attention to the dynamics of vorticity flux 2-surfaces and the action principles governing both individual flow trajetories and the evolution of the system as a whole. Macroscopic rotation of such a condensate requires the presence of a lattice of quantised vortex defects, whose averaged tension violates perfect fluid isotropy. It is shown that for any equation of state (relating the mass density equation to the pressure equation) the mesoscopic perfect fluid model can be extended in a uniquely simple and natural manner to a corresponding macroscopic model (in a conformally covariant category) that represents the effects of the vortex fibration anisotropy.

Each of them together with energy-momentum tensor of point-like particles satisfies the conservation laws when equations of motion of particles are the same as in general relativity. It is shown that in Newtonian approximation the considered tensors differ one from the other in the way their energy density is distributed between energy density of interaction (nonzero only at locations of particles) and energy density of gravitational field. Starting from Lorentz invariance the Lagrangians for spin-2, mass-0 field are considered. They differ only by divergences. From these Lagrangians by Belinfante-Rosenfeld procedure the energy-momentum tensors are build. Using each of these tensors in 3-graviton vertex we obtain the corresponding metric of a Newtonian center in equation approximation. Only one of these 'field-theretical'tensors (namely the half sum of Thirring tensor and tensor obtained from Lagrangian given by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler) leads to correct value of the perihelion shift. This tensor does not coincide with Weinberg`s one (directly obtainable from Einstein equation) and gives metric of a spherical body differing (in space part of metric in the first nonlinear approximation) from Schwarzschild field in harmonic coordinates.

As exotic manifolds are not diffeomorphic, one can argue that quantum amplitudes for gravity formulated as functional integrals should include a sum over not only physically distinct geometries and topologies but also inequivalent differentiable structures. But can the inclusion of exotic manifolds in such sums make a significant contribution to these quantum amplitudes? This paper will demonstrate that it will. Simply connected exotic Einstein manifolds with positive curvature exist in seven dimensions. Their metrics are found numerically; they are shown to have volumes of the same order of magnitude.

It is shown that in the classical theory conformal invariance places no condition on the form of the potential, but the conformal invariance of the classical reduction requires that it be an exponential. In contrast, the quantum theory requires that, even before reduction, the potential be a sum of two exponentials. The duality of these two exponentials is the fore-runner of the Liouville duality.

The dual action thus obtained describes a current-current, static interaction within the bulk volume bounded by the d-1-brane. Guided by these results, we then construct a general expression for the parent Lagrangian that allows for a unified treatment of p-duality, even in the presence of external currents, using a first order formalism instead of the Bianchi identities.

We point out that this result verifies a prediction made by us more than a decade ago from an analysis of a nonlocal model of QED. This model had earlier been proposed by us in an ad hoc manner to interpret certain features of multiphoton double ionization and above-threshold ionization in an atom placed in a strong laser field ; in this paper we show that the model can be obtained field- theoretically by demanding covariance of the field Lagrangian under a nonlocal U(1) gauge transformation. The model also makes direct contact with squeezed light, and thus allows us to describe these two completely different scenarios from a unified point of view.   We obtain a fundamentally new result from our nonlocal QED, namely that only the past, but not the future, can influence the present - thus establishing a non-thermodynamic arrow of time at the quantum level. We also show that correlations within a quantum system should necessarily be of the EPR-type, a result that agrees with Bell's theorem. These results follow from the simple requirement of energy conservation in matter-radiation interaction.

In four noncompact dimensions one is led to expect a Hagedorn spectrum in light cone energy. This suggests the possible relevance of 'little string theories' (LSTs) to the quantum description of four dimensional compactifications, because one can argue that their exact high energy spectrum has the Hagedorn form.

It can be applied to large-N theories, by keeping just the planar contribution to the gap equations. We analyze several models of scalar supersymmetric quantum mechanics, and show that the Gaussian approximation correctly distinguishes between a moduli space, mass gap, and supersymmetry breaking at strong coupling.

However, our approach is not of purely group theoretical origin, but emerges from a geometrical model. The rotational part of the Lorentz group can be seen to mutate into the internal iso-group under some additional assumptions. The bound states can thereafter be characterized by either a triple of spinors (letter1, letter2, letter) or a pair of an average spinor and a 'gauge' transformation (letter, R). Therefore, this triple can be considered to be an isospinor. Inducing the whole dynamics from the covariant gauge coupling we arrive at an isospin gauge theory and its Lagrangian formulation.

In this way, the cluster-separated limits are exact, and the Lorentz invariance / cluster separability requirement is automatically satisfied, provided no supplementary approximation, like the Born approximation, is made. The use of positive free-energy projectors in the chosen reductions of the two-fermion Bethe-Salpeter equations prevents continuum dissolution in our 3D three-fermion equation.

The role of the massive constituents is only to induce the cosmological constant. We consider the instanton solutions of the Euclidean Liouville gravity with negative and zero cosmological constants, some instantons being interpreted as two-dimensional anti-de Sitter equation black holes.

From the study of Dixon's multipoles for the energy-momentum tensor on the Wigner hyperplanes we derive the definition of the canonical center-of-mass variable for a Klein-Gordon field configuration: it turns out that the Longhi-Materassi global variable should be interpreted as a center of phase of the field configuration. A detailed study of the kinematical ""external"" and ""internal"" properties of the field configuration on the Wigner hyperplanes is done. The construction is then extended to charged Klein-Gordon fields: the centers of phase of the two real components can be combined to define a global center of phase and a collective relative variable describing the action-reaction between the two Feshbach-Villars components of the field with definite sign of energy and charge. The Dixon multipoles for both the energy-momentum and the electromagnetic current are given.

hep-th/9908160,hep-th,"The non-renormalization of the 3-point functions equation of chiral primary operators in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory is one of the most striking facts to emerge from the AdS/CFT correspondence. A two-fold puzzle appears in the extremal case, e.g. k1 = k2  k3. First, the supergravity calculation involves analytic continuation in the ki variables to define the product of a vanishing bulk coupling and an infinite integral over AdS. Second, extremal correlators are uniquely sensitive to mixing of the single-trace operators equation with protected multi-trace operators in the same representation of SU(4). We show that the calculation of extremal correlators from supergravity is subject to the same subtlety of regularization known for the 2-point functions, and we present a careful method which justifies the analytic continuation and shows that supergravity fields couple to single traces without admixture. We also study extremal n-point functions of chiral primary operators, and argue that Type IIB supergravity requires that their space-time form is a product of n-1 two-point functions (as in the free field approximation) multiplied by a non-renormalized coefficient. This non-renormalization property of extremal n-point functions is a new prediction of the AdS/CFT correspondence.

The total 'hairs' M, J and Q are exhibited as boundary terms at infinity. It is found that the inner horizon of the rotating uncharged black hole is unstable under the addition of a small electric charge. Next it is shown that when Q=0 the spinning black hole may be obtained from the one with J=0 by a Lorentz boost in the equation plane. This boost is an 'illegitimate coordinate transformation' because it changes the physical parameters of the solution. The extreme black hole appears as the analog of a particle moving with the speed of light. The same boost may be used when equation to generate a solution with angular momentum from that with J=0, although the geometrical meaning of the transformation is much less transparent since in the charged case the black holes are not obtained by identifying points in anti-de Sitter space. The metric is given explicitly in terms of three parameters, equation, equation and equation which are the 'rest mass' and 'rest charge' and the angular velocity of the boost. These parameters are related to M, J and Q through the solution of an algebraic cubic equation.

hep-th/9912150,hep-th,"We carefully re-examine the issues of solving the modified Bianchi identity, anomaly cancellations and flux quantization in the S1/Z2 orbifold of M-theory using the boundary-free ""upstairs"" formalism, avoiding several misconceptions present in earlier literature. While the solution for the four-form G to the modified Bianchi identity appears to depend on an arbitrary parameter b, we show that requiring G to be globally well-defined, i.e. invariant under small and large gauge and local Lorentz transformations, fixes b=1. This value also is necessary for a consistent reduction to the heterotic string in the small-radius limit. Insisting on properly defining all fields on the circle, we find that there is a previously unnoticed additional contribution to the anomaly inflow from the eleven-dimensional topological term. Anomaly cancellation then requires a quadratic relation between b and the combination lambda6/kappa4 of the gauge and gravitational coupling constants lambda and kappa. This contrasts with previous beliefs that anomaly cancellation would give a cubic equation for b. We observe that our solution for G automatically satisfies integer or half-integer flux quantization for the appropriate cycles. We explicitly write out the anomaly cancelling terms of the heterotic string as inherited from the M-theory approach. They differ from the usual ones by the addition of a well-defined local counterterm. We also show how five-branes enter our analysis.",1999,[],6

In order to circumvent these non-physical singularities, the headlong approach has always been to call for mathematical devices --- prescriptions --- some successful ones and others not so much so. A more elegant approach is to consider the propagator from its physical point of view, that is, an object obeying basic principles such as causality. Once this fact is realized and carefully taken into account, the crutch of prescriptions can be avoided altogether. An alternative third approach, which for practical computations could dispense with prescriptions as well as prescinding the necessity of careful stepwise watching out of causality would be of great advantage.

The inclusion of the Chern-Simons term makes impossible to choose a peculiar gauge in which a wave function renormalization is absent. The numerical evaluation shows that the wave function renormalization is fairly close to 1 in the Landau gauge. It means that this gauge is still a specific gauge where the Ward-Takahashi identity is satisfied approximately.

This property is obtained by direct evaluation of path integrals for Wilson loops defined for pure SU(2) gauge fields and Z(2) center vortices with spatial azimuthal symmetry. Further we show that both derivations given by Diakonov and Petrov for their regularized path integral, if done correctly, predict also zero for Wilson loops.

The introduction of the equivalence being consistent with the mathematical definition is possible only in theories constructed on non-standard number spaces by taking the experimental errors as infinitesimal numbers of the non-standard spaces. Following the idea for the equivalence (the physical equivalence), a new description of space-time in terms of infinitesimal-lattice points on non-standard real number space equation is proposed. The infinitesimal-lattice space, equation, is represented by the set of points on equation which are written by equation, where the infinitesimal lattice-spacing equation is determined by a non-standard natural number equation such that equation. By using infinitesimal neighborhoos (equation) of real number equation on equation we can make a space equation which is isomorphic to equation as additive group. Therefore, every point on equation automatically has the internal confined-subspace equation. A field theory on equation is proposed. To determine a projection from equation to equation, a fundamental principle based on the physical equivalence is introduced. The physical equivalence is expressed by the totally equal treatment for indistinguishable quantities in our observations. Following the principle, we show that U(1) and SU(N) symmetries on the space equation are induced from the internal substructure equation.

The mass spectrum of the models appeared in reduced dimensions is a full of variety, reflecting the highly nontrivial vacuum structure of the models.

hep-th/9906181,hep-th,"We have analyzed the Unruh problem in the frame of quantum field theory and have shown that the Unruh quantization scheme is valid in the double Rindler wedge rather than in Minkowski spacetime. The double Rindler wedge is composed of two disjoint regions (equation- and equation-wedges of Minkowski spacetime) which are causally separated from each other. Moreover the Unruh construction implies existence of boundary condition at the common edge of equation- and equation-wedges in Minkowski spacetime. Such boundary condition may be interpreted as a topological obstacle which gives rise to a superselection rule prohibiting any correlations between equation- and equation- Unruh particles. Thus the part of the field from the equation-wedge in no way can influence a Rindler observer living in the equation-wedge and therefore elimination of the invisible ""left"" degrees of freedom will take no effect for him. Hence averaging over states of the field in one wedge can not lead to thermalization of the state in the other.

Before the symmetry breaking fermions are represented by straight frozen strings - rotators, whose symmetry under the rotation around their axes is interpreted as the group equation. The emergence of equation group is somewhat less transparent and is supposed to be connected with the new degree of freedom of relativistic rotators, which leads to the up and down type fermions. The symmetry breaking is associated with the bending of the rotators under the influence of Higgs field and with their subsequent transformation into the curved frozen strings - tops.

hep-th/9906075,hep-th,"In this thesis I present applications of the Born-Infeld action to the description of D-branes, mostly in the context of type IIB string theory. First I present the Callan-Maldacena construction of a fundamental string attached to a threebrane, whereby the string is made out of the wrapped brane. This interpretation withstands a rather detailed scrutiny, including the magnitude of the static tension and of the B-I charge; and Polchinski's mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary conditions for small perturbations of the string. The latter arise dynamically from the full non-linear equations of motion. Also, the Born-Infeld charge is shown to produce the correct form of dipole radiation under the influence of harmonic oscillations of the string. The second part comprises of the application of these ideas to the AdS/CFT correspondence. Using the essentially non-perturbative nature of the B-I action we were able to construct in the near-horizon geometry of N D3-branes the color-singlet baryon vertex of the SU(N) gauge theory as a fivebrane wrapped on the equation sphere, with B-I strings playing the role of the quarks. Also, in the asymptotically flat background we obtain a smooth classical description of the Hanany-Witten phenomenon. In the case of non-extremal background we construct baryons of the three-dimensional non-supersymmetric theory, the low energy dynamics of which was conjectured to be equivalent to ordinary QCD. Our approach allows to exhibit confining properties of color flux tubes, i.e. the dependence of the tension of the flux tube on its color content.

We analyse the large-N limit of the measure and find that it admits two classes of saddle points: In the first class the space of collective coordinates has the geometry of equation which on the string theory side has the interpretation of the D-instantons being stuck on the 7-branes and therefore the resulting moduli space being equation, In the second class the geometry is equation and on the string theory side it means that the D-instantons are free to move in the 10-dimensional bulk. We discuss in detail a correlator of four O(8) flavour currents on the Yang-Mills side, which receives contributions from the first type of saddle points only, and show that it matches with the correlator obtained from equation coupling on the string theory side, which receives contribution from D-instantons, in perfect accord with the AdS/CFT correspondence.

There are several DLCQ formulations of this theory currently in the literature and they naively appear to behave differently under `soft' supersymmetry breaking at finite resolution. We show that all these formulations nevertheless yield identical bound state masses in the decompactification limit of the light-like circle. Moreover, we are able to show that the supersymmetry-inspired version of DLCQ (so called `SDLCQ') provides the best rate of convergence of DLCQ bound state masses towards the actual continuum values, except possibly near or at the critical fermion mass. In this last case, we discuss improved extrapolation schemes that must supplement the DLCQ algorithm in order to obtain correct continuum bound state masses. Interestingly, when we truncate the Fock space to two particles, the SDLCQ prescription presented here provides a scheme for improving the rate of convergence of the massive t'Hooft model. Thus the supersymmetry-inspired SDLCQ prescription is applicable to theories without supersymmetry.",1999,[],6

Superradiant modes reflected off the potential barrier outside the hole would be re-amplified at the horizon, and a classical instability would result. We point out that the existence of a Killing vector field timelike everywhere outside the horizon prevents this from occurring for black holes with negative action. Such black holes are also thermodynamically stable in the grand canonical ensemble. The CFT duals of these black holes correspond to a theory in an Einstein universe with a chemical potential and a theory in a rotating Einstein universe. We study these CFTs in the zero coupling limit. In the first case, Bose-Einstein condensation occurs on the boundary at a critical value of the chemical potential. However the supergravity calculation demonstrates that this is not to be expected at strong coupling.

First, the problem of constructing Lorentz-invariant self-couplings of a single chiral two-form is investigated in the light of the Dirac-Schwinger condition on the energy-momentum tensor commutation relations. We show how the Perry-Schwarz condition follows from the Dirac-Schwinger criterion and point out that consistency of the gravitational coupling is automatic. Secondly, we study the possible local deformations of chiral two-forms. This problem reduces to the study of the local BRST cohomological group at ghost number zero. We proof that the only consistent deformations of a system of free chiral two-forms are (up to redefinitions) deformations that do not modify the abelian gauge symmetries of the free theory.

For this, we consider fluctuations in the graviton, gravitino and 3-form around the flat background, which couple to the boundary equation gauge-supermultiplet. They give rise to exchange amplitudes or forces between both boundary fixed-planes. In leading order of the D=11 gravitational coupling constant equation, we find an expected trivial vanishing of all three amplitudes and thereby stability of the flat vacuum in the static limit, in which the centre-of-mass energy equation of the gauge-multiplet fields is zero. For equation, however, which could be regarded a vacuum state with excitations on the boundary, the amplitudes neither vanish nor cancel each other, thus leading to an attractive force between the fixed-planes in the flat vacuum. A ground state showing stability with regard to boundary excitations, is therefore expected to exhibit a non-trivial metric. Ten-dimensional Lorentz-invariance requires a warped geometry.

Using Seiberg's scaling argument we relate the matrix theory action to a low-energy system of many D0-branes in an arbitrary but weak NS-NS and R-R background. The resulting multiple D0-brane action agrees with the known Born-Infeld action in the case of a single brane and gives an explicit formulation of many additional terms which appear in the multiple brane action. The linear coupling to an arbitrary background metric satisfies the nontrivial consistency condition suggested by Douglas that the masses of off-diagonal fields are given by the geodesic distance between the corresponding pair of D0-branes. This agreement arises from combinatorial factors which depend upon the symmetrized trace ordering prescription found earlier for higher moments of the matrix theory stress-energy tensor.

The quantization consists of two procedures. One is related with quantization of the asymptotic Virasoro symmetry. A notion of the Virasoro deformation of 3-geometry is introduced. For a given black hole, the deformation of the exterior of the outer horizon is identified with a product of appropriate coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro groups equation. Its quantization provides unitary irreducible representations of the Virasoro algebra, in which state of the black hole becomes primary. To make the quantization complete, holonomies, the global degrees of freedom, are taken into account. By an identification of these topological operators with zero modes of the Liouville field, the aforementioned unitary representations reveal, as far as equation, as the Hilbert space of this two-dimensional conformal field theory. This conformal field theory, living on the cylinder at infinity of the black hole and having continuous spectrums, can recognize the outer horizon only as a it one-dimensional object in equation and realize it as insertions of the corresponding vertex operator.

When 0<a<1 the model admits an OSp(28) supertwistor description, and when a>1 the supertwistor group becomes OSp(1,18). We quantize the model and find that its quantum spectrum consists of massless states of an arbitrary (half)integer helicity. The independent discrete central charge coordinate describes the helicity spectrum. We also outline the generalization of the a=1 model to higher space-time dimensions and demonstrate that in D=3,4,6 and 10, where the quantum states are massless, the extra degrees of freedom (with respect to those of the standard superparticle) parametrize compact manifolds.

These field theories have a T-dual realization in terms of type IIA configurations of relatively rotated NS fivebranes, D4-branes and orientifold six-planes, with a compact equation direction, along which the D4-branes have finite extent. We compute the spectrum on the D3-branes directly in the type IIB picture and match the resulting field theories with those obtained in the type IIA setup, thus providing a non-trivial check of this T-duality. Since the usual techniques to compute the spectrum of the model and check the cancellation of tadpoles, cannot be applied to the case orientifolds of non-orbifold singularities, we use a different approach, and construct the models by partially blowing-up orientifolds of C3/(Z2 x Z2) and C3/(Z2 x Z3) orbifolds.",1999,[],6
hep-th/9909189,hep-th,"We study an Abelian Chern-Simons and Fermion system in three dimensions. In the presence of a fixed prescribed background magnetic field we find an infinite number of fully three-dimensional solutions. These solutions are related to Hopf maps and are, therefore, labelled by the Hopf index. Further we discuss the interpretation of the background field.",1999,[],6
hep-th/9902109,hep-th,A free fermionic string quantum model is constructed directly in the light-cone variables in the range of dimensions equation. It is shown that after the GSO projection this model is equivalent to the fermionic massive string and to the non-critical Rammond-Neveu-Schwarz string. The spin spectrum of the model is analysed. For equation the character generating functions is obtained and the particle content of first few levels is numerically calculated.,1999,[],6
hep-th/9912256,hep-th,"The zero-hamiltonian problem, present in reparametrization invariant systems, is solved for the 2-D induced gravity model. Working with methods developed by Henneaux et al. we find systematically the reduced phase-space physics, generated by an \it effective hamiltonian obtained after complete gauge fixing.",1999,[],6
hep-th/9903039,hep-th,"We study the microcanonical description of string gases in the presence of D-branes. We obtain exact expressions for the single string density of states and draw the regions in phase space where asymptotic approximations are valid. We are able to describe the whole range of energies including the SYM phase of the D-branes and we remark the importance of the infrared cut-off used in the high energy approximations. With the complete expression we can obtain the density of states of the multiple string gas and study its thermal properties, showing that the Hagedorn temperature is maximum for every system and there is never a phase transition whenever there is thermal contact among the strings attached to different D-branes.",1999,[],6

hep-th/9912101,hep-th,"In this note we point out that a symmetric product orbifold CFT can be twisted by a unique nontrivial two-cocycle of the permutation group. This discrete torsion changes the spins and statistics of corresponding second-quantized string theory making it essentially 'supersymmetric.' The long strings of even length become fermionic (or ghosts), those of odd length bosonic. The partition function and elliptic genus can be described by a sum over stringy spin structures. The usual cubic interaction vertex is odd and nilpotent, so this construction gives rise to a DLCQ string theory with a leading quartic interaction.",1999,[],6
hep-th/9907197,hep-th,"We study classical solutions of a particular version of the modified Skyrme model in (31) dimensions. The model possesses Skyrmion solutions as well as stable domain walls that connect different vacua of the theory. We show that there is an attractive interaction between Skyrmions and domain walls. Thus Skyrmions can be captured by the domain walls. We show also that, when the mass term is of a special type, the model possesses bound states of Skyrmions and of the domain wall. They look like deformed 2-dimensional Skyrmions captured by the wall. The field configurations of these solutions can interpreted as having come from the evolution of the 3-dimensional Skyrmions captured by the domain wall. For more conventional choices of the mass term of the model in the model the attraction between the Skyrmions and the wall leads to the capture of the Skyrmions which are then turned into topological waves which spread out on the wall. We have observed, numerically, such captures and the emission of the waves.   We speculate that this observation may be useful in the explanation of the problem of baryogenesis and baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the Universe.",1999,[],6
