1403.5640,astro-ph,"We present high spatial resolution spectropolarimetric observations of a quiescent hedgerow prominence taken in the He I 1083.0 nm triplet. The observation consisted of a time series in sit-and-stare mode of 36 minutes of duration. The spectrograph's slit crossed the prominence body and we recorded the time evolution of individual vertical threads. Eventually, we observed the development of a dark Rayleigh-Taylor plume that propagated upward with a velocity, projected onto the plane of the sky, of 17 km/s. Interestingly, the plume apex collided with the prominence threads pushing them aside. We inferred Doppler shifts, Doppler widths, and magnetic field strength variations by interpreting the He I Stokes profiles with the HAZEL code. The Doppler shifts show that clusters of threads move coherently while individual threads have oscillatory patterns. Regarding the plume we found strong redshifts (9-12 km/s) and large Doppler widths (10 km/s) at the plume apex when it passed through the prominence body and before it disintegrated. We associate the redshifts with perspective effects while the Doppler widths are more likely due to an increase in the local temperature. No local variations of the magnetic field strength associated with the passage of the plume were found; this leads us to conclude that the plumes are no more magnetized than the surroundings. Finally, we found that some of the threads oscillations are locally damped, what allowed us to apply prominence seismology techniques to infer additional prominence physical parameters.",14,[],1
1405.6511,astro-ph,"In recent years, new coronagraphic schemes have been proposed, the most promising being the optical vortex phase mask coronagraphs. In our work, a new scheme of broadband optical scalar vortex coronagraph is proposed and characterized experimentally in the laboratory. Our setup employs a pair of computer generated phase gratings (one of them containing a singularity) to control the chromatic dispersion of phase plates and achieves a constant peak-to-peak attenuation below 1:1000 over a bandwidth of 120 nm centered at 700 nm. An inner working angle of equation/D is demonstrated along with a raw contrast of 11.5\,magnitudes at 2equation/D. A more compact setup achieves a peak-to-peak attenuation below 1:1000 over a bandwidth of 60 nm with the other results remaining the same.",14,[],1
1408.0817,astro-ph,"The long and almost continuous observations by Kepler show clear evidence of a granulation background signal in a large sample of stars, which is interpreted as the surface manifestation of convection. It has been shown that its characteristic timescale and rms intensity fluctuation scale with the peak frequency (lettermax) of the solar-like oscillations. Various attempts have been made to quantify the observed signal, to determine scaling relations, and to compare them to theoretical predictions. We use a probabilistic method to compare different approaches to extracting the granulation signal. We fit the power density spectra of a large set of Kepler targets, determine the granulation and global oscillation parameter, and quantify scaling relations between them. We establish that a depression in power at about lettermax/2, known from the Sun and a few other main-sequence stars, is also statistically significant in red giants and that a super-Lorentzian function with two components is best suited to reproducing the granulation signal in the broader vicinity of the pulsation power excess. We also establish that the specific choice of the background model can affect the determination of lettermax, introducing systematic uncertainties that can significantly exceed the random uncertainties. We find the characteristic background frequency and amplitude to tightly scale with lettermax for a wide variety of stars, and quantify a mass dependency of the latter. To enable comparison with theoretical predictions, we computed effective timescales and intensity fluctuations and found them to approximately scale as lettereff \propto g-0.85\,T-0.4 and Agran \propto (g2M)-1/4, respectively. Similarly, the bolometric pulsation amplitude scales approximately as Apuls \propto (g2M)-1/3, which implicitly verifies a separate mass and luminosity dependence of Apuls.",14,[],1
1407.3451,astro-ph,"Simulating the evolution of the local universe is important for studying galaxies and the intergalactic medium in a way free of cosmic variance. Here we present a method to reconstruct the initial linear density field from an input non-linear density field, employing the Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm combined with Particle Mesh (PM) dynamics. The HMCPM method is applied to cosmological simulations, and the reconstructed linear density fields are then evolved to the present day with N-body simulations. The constrained simulations so obtained accurately reproduce both the amplitudes and phases of the input simulations at various equation. Using a PM model with a grid cell size of 0.75 Mpc/h and 40 time-steps in the HMC can recover more than half of the phase information down to a scale k~0.85 h/Mpc at high z and to k~3.4 h/Mpc at z=0, which represents a significant improvement over similar reconstruction models in the literature, and indicates that our model can reconstruct the formation histories of cosmic structures over a large dynamical range. Adopting PM models with higher spatial and temporal resolutions yields even better reconstructions, suggesting that our method is limited more by the availability of computer resource than by principle. Dynamic models of structure evolution adopted in many earlier investigations can induce non-Gaussianity in the reconstructed linear density field, which in turn can cause large systematic deviations in the predicted halo mass function. Such deviations are greatly reduced or absent in our reconstruction.",14,[],1
1409.2506,astro-ph,"As a copious source of gamma-rays, a nearby Galactic Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) can be a threat to life. Using recent determinations of the rate of GRBs, their luminosity function and properties of their host galaxies, we estimate the probability that a life-threatening (lethal) GRB would take place. Amongst the different kinds of GRBs, long ones are most dangerous. There is a very good chance (but no certainty) that at least one lethal GRB took place during the past 5 Gyr close enough to Earth as to significantly damage life. There is a 50% chance that such a lethal GRB took place during the last 500 Myr causing one of the major mass extinction events. Assuming that a similar level of radiation would be lethal to life on other exoplanets hosting life, we explore the potential effects of GRBs to life elsewhere in the Galaxy and the Universe. We find that the probability of a lethal GRB is much larger in the inner Milky Way (95% within a radius of 4 kpc from the galactic center), making it inhospitable to life. Only at the outskirts of the Milky Way, at more than 10 kpc from the galactic center, this probability drops below 50%. When considering the Universe as a whole, the safest environments for life (similar to the one on Earth) are the lowest density regions in the outskirts of large galaxies and life can exist in only ~ 10% of galaxies. Remarkably, a cosmological constant is essential for such systems to exist. Furthermore, because of both the higher GRB rate and galaxies being smaller, life as it exists on Earth could not take place at equation. Early life forms must have been much more resilient to radiation.",14,[],1
1408.2521,astro-ph,"We present results on the z~2.3 mass-metallicity relation (MZR) using early observations from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey. We use an initial sample of 87 star-forming galaxies with spectroscopic coverage of Hletter, [OIII]letter 5007, H\alpha, and [NII]letter 6584 rest-frame optical emission lines, and estimate the gas-phase oxygen abundance based on the N2 and O3N2 strong-line indicators. We find a positive correlation between stellar mass and metallicity among individual z~2.3 galaxies using both the N2 and O3N2 indicators. We also measure the emission-line ratios and corresponding oxygen abundances for composite spectra in bins of stellar mass. Among composite spectra, we find a monotonic increase in metallicity with increasing stellar mass, offset ~0.15-0.3 dex below the local MZR. When the sample is divided at the median star-formation rate (SFR), we do not observe significant SFR dependence of the z~2.3 MZR among either individual galaxies or composite spectra. We furthermore find that z~2.3 galaxies have metallicities ~0.1 dex lower at a given stellar mass and SFR than is observed locally. This offset suggests that high-redshift galaxies do not fall on the local ""fundamental metallicity relation"" among stellar mass, metallicity, and SFR, and may provide evidence of a phase of galaxy growth in which the gas reservoir is built up due to inflow rates that are higher than star-formation and outflow rates. However, robust conclusions regarding the gas-phase oxygen abundances of high-redshift galaxies await a systematic reappraisal of the application of locally calibrated metallicity indicators at high redshift.",14,[],1
1406.1288,astro-ph,"Hot star wind mass-loss rates depend on the abundance of individual elements. This dependence is usually accounted for assuming scaled solar chemical composition. However, this approach may not be justified in evolved rotating stars. The rotational mixing brings CNO-processed material to the stellar surface, increasing the abundance of nitrogen at the expense of carbon and oxygen, which potentially influences the mass-loss rates. We study the influence of the modified chemical composition resulting from the rotational mixing on the wind parameters, particularly the wind mass-loss rates. We use our NLTE wind code to predict the wind structure and compare the calculated wind mass-loss rate for the case of scaled solar chemical composition and the composition affected by the CNO cycle. We show that for a higher mass-fraction of heavier elements equation the change of chemical composition from the scaled solar to the CNO-processed scaled solar composition does not significantly affect the wind mass-loss rates. The missing line force caused by carbon and oxygen is compensated for by nitrogen line force. However, for a very low-mass fraction of heavier elements equation the rotational mixing significantly affects the wind mass-loss rates. Moreover, the decrease of the mass-loss rate with metallicity is stronger at such low metallicities. We study the relevance of the wind momentum-luminosity relationship for different metallicities and show that for a metallicity equation the relationship displays a large scatter, which depreciates the use of this relationship at the lowest metallicities.",14,[],1
1409.2930,astro-ph,"In this Master's project, the X-ray nuclear properties of a sample of bright nearby galaxies are explored. This is done by matching their comprehensive optical spectroscopic classification to the latest available XMM-Newton catalogue - 3XMM-DR4. The good coverage (approx. 38 per cent) ensures that a statistically representative sample is investigated. All nuclear and morphological subsets found within the original sample of 486 galaxies are encompassed, but early-type galaxies and galaxies with optical features characteristic for active galactic nuclei (AGN) are favoured. The results from the investigation of the properties of our cross-matched sample are overall consistent with the presence of a large fraction of X-ray - detected low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN). The X-ray - detected galaxies within our HII and transition-LINER subsets are of particular interest, as they could harbour LLAGN missed by optical spectroscopic selection. The properties of these nuclei are explored by X-ray spectral fitting of available XMM-Newton observations. The majority of the examined spectra are found to be consistent with a thermal plasma model and an underlying power-law continuum, and the relative contributions of a potential LLAGN and of thermal emission to the source luminosity are presented. In the case that these spectra are not highly contaminated, as confirmed for some of the nuclei by examining available higher-resolution Chandra images, we classify approx. 43 per cent of the HII nuclei and 40 per cent of the transition-LINER nuclei as optically undetected LLAGN-candidates. This classification is found to be reasonably successful, given the project limitations, when compared to X-ray and multi-wavelength results found in literature for many of the nuclei.",14,[],1
1402.5931,astro-ph,"Context. Cygnus A, as the nearest powerful FR II radio galaxy, plays an important role in understanding jets and their impact on the surrounding intracluster medium. Aims. To explain why the nucleus is observed superposed onto the eastern lobe rather than in between the two lobes, and why the jet and counterjet are non-colinear. Methods. We made a comparative study of the radio images at different frequencies of Cygnus A, in combination with the published results on the radial velocities in the Cygnus A cluster. Results. From the morphology of the inner lobes we conclude that the lobes are not interacting with one another, but are well separated, even at low radio frequencies. We explain the location of the nucleus as the result of the proper motion of the galaxy through the cluster. The required proper motion is of the same order of magnitude as the radial velocity offset of Cygnus A with the sub-cluster it belongs to. The proper motion of the galaxy through the cluster likely also explains the non-co-linearity of the jet and counterjet.",14,[],1
1405.2613,astro-ph,"Well-sampled optical and radio light curves of BL Lacertae in B, V, R, I bands and 4.8, 8.0, 14.5 GHz from 1968 to 2014 were presented in this paper. A possible equation yr period in optical bands and a equation yr period in radio bands were detected based on discrete correlation function, structure function as well as Jurkevich method. Correlations among different bands were also analyzed and no reliable time delay was found between optical bands. Very weak correlations were detected between V band and radio bands. However, in radio bands the variation at low frequency lagged that at high frequency obviously. The spectrum of BL Lacertae turned mildly bluer when the object turned brighter, and stronger bluer-when-brighter trends were found for short flares. A scenario including a precessing helical jet and periodic shocks was put forward to interpret the variation characteristics of BL Lacertae.",14,[],1
1409.6650,astro-ph,"Our knowledge of the strengths of small bodies in the Solar System is limited by our poor understanding of their internal structures, and this, in turn, clouds our understanding of the formation and evolution of these bodies. Observations of the rotational states of asteroids whose diameters are larger than a few hundreds of meters have revealed that they are dominated by gravity and that most are unlikely to be monoliths; however, there is a wide range of plausible internal structures. Numerical and analytical studies of shape and spin limits of gravitational aggregates and their collisional evolution show a strong dependence on shear strength. In order to study this effect, we carry out a systematic exploration of the dependence of collision outcomes on dissipation and friction parameters of the material components making up the bodies. We simulate the catastrophic disruption (leading to the largest remnant retaining 50% of the original mass) of km-size asteroids modeled as gravitational aggregates using pkdgrav, a cosmology N-body code adapted to collisional problems and recently enhanced with a new soft-sphere collision algorithm that includes more realistic contact forces. We find that for a range of three different materials, higher friction and dissipation values increase the catastrophic disruption threshold by about half a magnitude. Furthermore, we find that pre-impact rotation systematically increases mass loss on average, regardless of the target's internal configuration. Our results have important implications for the efficiency of planet formation via planetesimal growth, and also more generally to estimate the impact energy threshold for catastrophic disruption, as this generally has only been evaluated for non-spinning bodies without detailed consideration of material properties.",14,[],1
1404.3858,astro-ph,"Hesperian chaotic terrains have been recognized as the source of outflow channels formed by catastrophic outflows. Four main scenarios have been proposed for the formation of chaotic terrains that involve different amounts of water and single or multiple outflow events. Here, we test these scenarios with morphological and structural analyses of imagery and elevation data for Aram Chaos in conjunction with numerical modeling of the morphological evolution of the catastrophic carving of the outflow valley. The morphological and geological analyses of Aram Chaos suggest large-scale collapse and subsidence (1500 m) of the entire area, which is consistent with a massive expulsion of liquid water from the subsurface in one single event. The combined observations suggest a complex process starting with the outflow of water from two small channels, followed by continuous groundwater sapping and headward erosion and ending with a catastrophic lake rim collapse and carving of the Aram Valley, which is synchronous with the 2.5 Ga stage of the Ares Vallis formation. The water volume and formative time scale required to carve the Aram channels indicate that a single, rapid (maximum tens of days) and catastrophic (flood volume of 9.3?104 km3) event carved the outflow channel. We conclude that a sub-ice lake collapse model can best explain the features of the Aram Chaos Valley system as well as the time scale required for its formation.",14,['physics'],1
1409.4467,astro-ph,"We present a new `supercalibration' technique for measuring systematic distortions in the wavelength scales of high resolution spectrographs. By comparing spectra of `solar twin' stars or asteroids with a reference laboratory solar spectrum, distortions in the standard thorium--argon calibration can be tracked with equation10 m sequation precision over the entire optical wavelength range on scales of both echelle orders (equation50--100 \AA) and entire spectrographs arms (equation1000--3000 \AA). Using archival spectra from the past 20 years we have probed the supercalibration history of the VLT--UVES and Keck--HIRES spectrographs. We find that systematic errors in their wavelength scales are ubiquitous and substantial, with long-range distortions varying between typically equation200 m sequation per 1000 \AA. We apply a simple model of these distortions to simulated spectra that characterize the large UVES and HIRES quasar samples which previously indicated possible evidence for cosmological variations in the fine-structure constant, equation. The spurious deviations in equation produced by the model closely match important aspects of the VLT--UVES quasar results at all redshifts and partially explain the HIRES results, though not self-consistently at all redshifts. That is, the apparent ubiquity, size and general characteristics of the distortions are capable of significantly weakening the evidence for variations in equation from quasar absorption lines.",14,"['gr-qc', 'hep-ph']",1
1405.3281,astro-ph,"We search for signatures of reionization in the star formation histories (SFHs) of 38 Local Group dwarf galaxies (10equation equation Mequation equation 10equation Mequation). The SFHs are derived from color-magnitude diagrams using archival Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 imaging. Only five quenched galaxies (And V, And VI, And XIII, Leo IV, Hercules) are consistent with forming the bulk of their stars before reionization, when full uncertainties are considered. Observations of 13 of the predicted `true fossils' identified by Bovill & Ricotti show that only two (Hercules and Leo IV) indicate star formation quenched by reionization. However, both are within the virial radius of the Milky Way and evidence of tidal disturbance complicates this interpretation. We argue that the late-time gas capture scenario posited by Ricotti for the low mass, gas-rich, and star-forming fossil candidate Leo T is observationally indistinguishable from simple gas retention. Given the ambiguity between environmental effects and reionization, the best reionization fossil candidates are quenched low mass field galaxies (e.g., KKR 25).",14,[],1
1407.2868,astro-ph,"Important insights into the formation, structure, evolution and environment of all types of stars can be obtained through the measurement of their winds and possible magnetospheres. However, this has hardly been done up to now mainly because of the lack of UV instrumentation available for long periods of time. To reach this aim, we have designed UVMag, an M-size space mission equipped with a high-resolution spectropolarimeter working in the UV and visible spectral range. The UV domain is crucial in stellar physics as it is very rich in atomic and molecular lines and contains most of the flux of hot stars. Moreover, covering the UV and visible spectral domains at the same time will allow us to study the star and its environment simultaneously. Adding polarimetric power to the spectrograph will multiply tenfold the capabilities of extracting information on stellar magnetospheres, winds, disks, and magnetic fields. Examples of science objectives that can be reached with UVMag are presented for pre-main sequence, main sequence and evolved stars. They will cast new light onto stellar physics by addressing many exciting and important questions. UVMag is currently undergoing a Research and Technology study and will be proposed at the forthcoming ESA call for M-size missions. This spectropolarimeter could also be installed on a large UV and visible observatory (e.g. NASA's LUVOIR project) within a suite of instruments.",14,[],1
1403.4973,astro-ph,"The co-evolution of a supermassive black hole with its host galaxy through cosmic time is encoded in its spin. At equation, supermassive black holes are thought to grow mostly by merger-driven accretion leading to high spin. However, it is unknown whether below equation these black holes continue to grow via coherent accretion or in a chaotic manner, though clear differences are predicted in their spin evolution. An established method to measure the spin of black holes is via the study of relativistic reflection features from the inner accretion disk. Owing to their greater distances, there has hitherto been no significant detection of relativistic reflection features in a moderate-redshift quasar. Here, we use archival data together with a new, deep observation of a gravitationally-lensed quasar at equation to rigorously detect and study reflection in this moderate-redshift quasar. The level of relativistic distortion present in this reflection spectrum enables us to constrain the emission to originate within equation gravitational radii from the black hole, implying a spin parameter equation at the equation level of confidence and equation at the equation level. The high spin found here is indicative of growth via coherent accretion for this black hole, and suggests that black hole growth between equation occurs principally by coherent rather than chaotic accretion episodes.",14,[],1
1412.1306,astro-ph,"Accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars are an important subset of low-mass X-ray binaries in which coherent X-ray pulsations can be observed during occasional, bright outbursts (X-ray luminosity equation erg sequation). These pulsations show that matter is being channeled onto the neutron star's magnetic poles. However, such sources spend most of their time in a low-luminosity, quiescent state (equation erg sequation), where the nature of the accretion flow onto the neutron star (if any) is not well understood. Here we report that the millisecond pulsar/low-mass X-ray binary transition object PSR J10230038 intermittently shows coherent X-ray pulsations at luminosities nearly 100 times fainter than observed in any other accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar. We conclude that in spite of its low luminosity PSR J10230038 experiences episodes of channeled accretion, a discovery that challenges existing models for accretion onto magnetized neutron stars.",14,[],1
1408.4896,astro-ph,"We study the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) distortion of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) from extensive circumgalactic gas (CGM) in massive galactic halos. Recent observations have shown that galactic halos contain a large amount of X-ray emitting gas at the virial temperature, as well as a significant amount of warm OVI absorbing gas. We consider the SZ distortion from the hot gas in those galactic halos in which the gas cooling time is longer than the halo destruction time scale. We show that the SZ distortion signal from the hot gas in these galactic halos at redshifts equation can be significant at small angular scales (equation), and dominate over the signal from galaxy clusters. The estimated SZ signal for most massive galaxies (halo mass equation Mequation) is consistent with the marginal detection by \it Planck at these mass scales. We also consider the SZ effect from warm circumgalactic gas. The integrated Compton distortion from the warm OVI absorbing gas is estimated to be equation, which could potentially be detected by experiments planned for the near future. Finally, we study the detectability of the SZ signal from circumgalactic gas in two types of surveys, a simple extension of the SPT survey and a more futuristic cosmic variance-limited survey. We find that these surveys can easily detect the kSZ signal from CGM. With the help of a Fisher Matrix analysis, we find that it will be possible for these surveys to constrain the gas fraction in CGM, after marginalizing over cosmological parameters, to equation\%, in case of no redshift evolution of the gas fraction.",14,[],1
1409.2312,astro-ph,"Spectroscopy of exoplanetary atmospheres has become a well established method for the characterisation of extrasolar planets. We here present a novel inverse retrieval code for exoplanetary atmospheres. TauRex (Tau Retrieval for Exoplanets) is a line-by-line radiative transfer fully Bayesian retrieval framework. TauRex includes the following features: 1) the optimised use of molecular line-lists from the Exomol project; 2) an unbiased atmospheric composition prior selection, through custom built pattern recognition software; 3) the use of two independent algorithms to fully sample the Bayesian likelihood space: nested sampling as well as a more classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach; 4) iterative Bayesian parameter and model selection using the full Bayesian Evidence as well as the Savage-Dickey Ratio for nested models, and 5) the ability to fully map very large parameter spaces through optimal code parallelisation and scalability to cluster computing. In this publication we outline the TauRex framework and demonstrate, using a theoretical hot-Jupiter transmission spectrum, the parameter retrieval and model selection. We investigate the impact of Signal-to-Noise and spectral resolution on the retrievability of individual model parameters, both in terms of error bars on the temperature and molecular mixing ratios as well as its effect on the model's global Bayesian evidence.",14,[],1
1411.4002,astro-ph,"The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will form the largest radio telescope ever built and such a huge instrument in the desert poses enormous engineering and logistic challenges. Algorithmic and architectural breakthroughs are needed.   Data is collected and processed in groups of antennas before transport for central processing. This processing includes beamforming, primarily so as to reduce the amount of data sent. The principal existing technique points to a region of interest independently of the sky model and how the other stations beamform.   We propose a new collaborative beamforming algorithm in order to maximize information captured at the stations (thus reducing the amount of data transported). The method increases the diversity in measurements through randomized beam- forming. We demonstrate through numerical simulation the effectiveness of the method. In particular, we show that randomized beamforming can achieve the same image quality while producing 40% less data when compared to the prevailing method matched beamforming.",14,[],1

Semi-relativistic giant stars will be detectable with forthcoming telescopes out to a distance of a few Mpc, where their proper motion, radial velocity, and age, can be spectroscopically measured. In difference from traditional cosmological messengers, such as photons, neutrinos, or cosmic-rays, these stars shine and so their trajectories need not be directed at the observer for them to be detected. Tracing the stars to their parent galaxies as a function of speed and age will provide a novel test of the equivalence principle and the standard cosmological parameters. Semi-relativistic stars could also flag black hole binaries as gravitational wave sources for the future eLISA observatory.",14,[],1
1410.3310,astro-ph,"Several studies have shown the distribution of pulsars' magnetic inclination angles to be skewed towards low values compared with the distribution expected if the rotation and magnetic axes are placed randomly on the star. Here we focus on a sample of 28 equation-ray-detected pulsars using data taken as part of the Parkes telescope's \emphFERMI timing program. In doing so we find a preference in the sample for low magnetic inclination angles, equation, in stark contrast to both the expectation that the magnetic and rotation axes are orientated randomly at the birth of the pulsar and to equation-ray-emission-model-based expected biases. In this paper, after exploring potential explanations, we conclude that there are two possible causes of this preference, namely that low equation values are intrinsic to the sample, or that the emission regions extend outside what is traditionally thought to be the open-field-line region in a way which is dependent on the magnetic inclination. Each possibility is expected to have important consequences, ranging from supernova physics to population studies of pulsars and considerations of the radio beaming fraction. We also present a simple conversion scheme between the observed and intrinsic magnetic inclinations which is valid under the assumption that the observed skew is not intrinsic and which can be applied to all existing measurements. We argue that extending the active field-line region will help to resolve the existing tension between emission geometries derived from radio polarisation measurements and those required to model equation-ray light curves.",14,[],1
1405.5521,astro-ph,"There is currently no consistent approach to modelling galaxy bias evolution in cosmological inference. This lack of a common standard makes the rigorous comparison or combination of probes difficult. We show that the choice of biasing model has a significant impact on cosmological parameter constraints for a survey such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES), considering the 2-point correlations of galaxies in five tomographic redshift bins. We find that modelling galaxy bias with a free biasing parameter per redshift bin gives a Figure of Merit (FoM) for Dark Energy equation of state parameters w0, wa smaller by a factor of 10 than if a constant bias is assumed. An incorrect bias model will also cause a shift in measured values of cosmological parameters. Motivated by these points and focusing on the redshift evolution of linear bias, we propose the use of a generalised galaxy bias which encompasses a range of bias models from theory, observations and simulations, b(z) = c  (b0 - c)/D(z)alpha, where parameters c, b0 and alpha depend on galaxy properties such as halo mass. For a DES-like galaxy survey we find that this model gives an unbiased estimate of w0, wa with the same number or fewer nuisance parameters and a higher FoM than a simple b(z) model allowed to vary in z-bins. We show how the parameters of this model are correlated with cosmological parameters. We fit a range of bias models to two recent datasets, and conclude that this generalised parameterisation is a sensible benchmark expression of galaxy bias on large scales.",14,[],1
1408.4126,astro-ph,"We analyse the possible contribution of topological defects to cosmic microwave anisotropies, both temperature and polarisation. We allow for the presence of both inflationary scalars and tensors, and of polarised dust foregrounds that may contribute to or dominate the B-mode polarisation signal. We confirm and quantify our previous statements that topological defects on their own are a poor fit to the B-mode signal. However, adding topological defects to a models with a tensor component or a dust component improves the fit around equation. Fitting simultaneously to both temperature and polarisation data, we find that textures fit almost as well as tensors (equation), while Abelian Higgs strings are ruled out as the sole source of the B-mode signal at low equation. The 95% confidence upper limits on models combining defects and dust are equation (Abelian Higgs strings), equation (semilocal strings) and equation (textures), a small reduction on the equation bounds.

1409.7394,astro-ph,"HD 50138 is a B[e] star surrounded by a large amount of circumstellar gas and dust. Its spectrum shows characteristics which may indicate either a pre- or a post-main-sequence system. Mapping the kinematics of the gas in the inner few au of the system contributes to a better understanding of its physical nature. We present the first high spatial and spectral resolution interferometric observations of the Br-gamma line of HD~50138, obtained with VLTI/AMBER. The line emission originates from a region more compact (up to 3 au) than the continuum-emitting region. Blue- and red-shifted emission originates from the two different hemispheres of an elongated structure perpendicular to the polarization angle. The velocity of the emitting medium decreases radially. An overall offset along the NW direction between the line- and continuum-emitting regions is observed. We compare the data with a geometric model of a thin Keplerian disk and a spherical halo on top of a Gaussian continuum. Most of the data are well reproduced by this model, except for the variability, the global offset and the visibility at the systemic velocity. The evolutionary state of the system is discussed; most diagnostics are ambiguous and may point either to a post-main-sequence or a pre-main-sequence nature.",14,[],1
1404.5623,astro-ph,"We anticipate the first direct detections of gravitational waves (GWs) with Advanced LIGO and Virgo later this decade. Though this groundbreaking technical achievement will be its own reward, a still greater prize could be observations of compact binary mergers in both gravitational and electromagnetic channels simultaneously. During Advanced LIGO and Virgo's first two years of operation, 2015 through 2016, we expect the global GW detector array to improve in sensitivity and livetime and expand from two to three detectors. We model the detection rate and the sky localization accuracy for binary neutron star (BNS) mergers across this transition. We have analyzed a large, astrophysically motivated source population using real-time detection and sky localization codes and higher-latency parameter estimation codes that have been expressly built for operation in the Advanced LIGO/Virgo era. We show that for most BNS events the rapid sky localization, available about a minute after a detection, is as accurate as the full parameter estimation.

1409.6996,astro-ph,"We discuss various applications of VIDE, the Void IDentification and Examination toolkit, an open-source Python/C code for finding cosmic voids in galaxy redshift surveys and N-body simulations. Based on a substantially enhanced version of ZOBOV, VIDE not only finds voids, but also summarizes their properties, extracts statistical information, and provides a Python-based platform for more detailed analysis, such as manipulating void catalogs and particle members, filtering, plotting, computing clustering statistics, stacking, comparing catalogs, and fitting density profiles. VIDE also provides significant additional functionality for pre-processing inputs: for example, VIDE can work with volume- or magnitude-limited galaxy samples with arbitrary survey geometries, or dark matter particles or halo catalogs in a variety of common formats. It can also randomly subsample inputs and includes a Halo Occupation Distribution model for constructing mock galaxy populations. VIDE has been used for a wide variety of applications, from discovering a universal density profile to estimating primordial magnetic fields, and is publicly available at http://bitbucket.org/cosmicvoids/videpublic and http://www.cosmicvoids.net.",14,[],1
1402.0803,astro-ph,"We consider the high mode density reported in the delta Scuti star HD 50844 observed by CoRoT. Using simulations, we find that extracting frequencies down to a given false alarm probability by means of successive prewhitening leads to a gross over-estimate of the number of frequencies in a star. This is due to blending of the peaks in the periodogram due to the finite duration of the time series. Prewhitening is equivalent to adding a frequency to the data which is carefully chosen to interfere destructively with a given frequency in the data. Since the frequency extracted from a blended peak is not quite correct, the interference is not destructive with the result that many additional fictitious frequencies are added to the data. In data with very high signal-to-noise, such as the CoRoT data, these spurious frequencies are highly significant. Continuous prewhitening thus causes a cascade of spurious frequencies which leads to a much larger estimate of the mode density than is actually the case. The results reported for HD 50844 are consistent with this effect. Direct comparison of the power in the raw periodogram in this star with that in delta Scuti stars observed by Kepler shows that HD 50844 has a typical mode density.",14,[],1

1402.3857,astro-ph,"Two formation scenarios have been proposed to explain the tight orbits of hot Jupiters. They could be formed in orbits with a small inclination (with respect to the stellar spin) via disk migration, or in more highly inclined orbits via high-eccentricity migration, where gravitational interactions with a companion and tidal dissipation are at play. Here we target hot Jupiter systems where the misalignment equation has been inferred observationally and we investigate whether their properties are consistent with high-eccentricity migration. Specifically, we study whether stellar tides can be responsible for the observed distribution of equation and orbital separations. Improving on previous studies, we use detailed models for each star, thus accounting for how convection (and tidal dissipation) depends on stellar properties. In line with observations suggesting that hotter stars have higher equation, we find that equation increases as the amount of stellar surface convection decreases. This trend supports the hypothesis that tides are the mechanism shaping the observed distribution of equation. Furthermore, we study the past orbital evolution of five representative systems, chosen to cover a variety of temperatures and misalignments. We consider various initial orbital configurations and integrate the equations describing the coupled evolution of the orbital separation, stellar spin, and misalignment. We account for stellar tides and wind mass loss, stellar evolution, and magnetic braking. We show that the current properties of these five representative systems can be explained naturally, given our current understanding of tidal dissipation and with physically motivated assumptions for the effects driving the orbital evolution.",14,[],1
1409.3576,astro-ph,"We use the Matryoshka run to study the time dependent statistics of structure-formation driven turbulence in the intracluster medium of a 10equation galaxy cluster. We investigate the turbulent cascade in the inner Mpc for both compressional and incompressible velocity components. The flow maintains approximate conditions of fully developed turbulence, with departures thereof settling in about an eddy-turnover-time. Turbulent velocity dispersion remains above equation km sequation even at low mass accretion rate, with the fraction of compressional energy between 10% and 40%. Normalisation and slope of compressional turbulence is susceptible to large variations on short time scales, unlike the incompressible counterpart. A major merger occurs around redshift equation and is accompanied by a long period of enhanced turbulence, ascribed to temporal clustering of mass accretion related to spatial clustering of matter. We test models of stochastic acceleration by compressional modes for the origin of diffuse radio emission in galaxy clusters. The turbulence simulation model constrains an important unknown of this complex problem and brings forth its dependence on the elusive micro-physics of the intracluster plasma. In particular, the specifics of the plasma collisionality and the dissipation physics of weak shocks affect the cascade of compressional modes with strong impact on the acceleration rates. In this context radio halos emerge as complex phenomena in which a hierarchy of processes acting on progressively smaller scales are at work. Stochastic acceleration by compressional modes implies statistical correlation of radio power and spectral index with merging cores distance, both testable in principle with radio surveys.",14,[],1

1411.3741,astro-ph,"The Chamaeleon clouds are excellent targets for low-mass star formation studies. Cha I and II are actively forming stars while Cha III shows no sign of ongoing star formation. We aim to determine the driving factors that have led to the very different levels of star formation activity in Cha I and III and examine the dynamical state and possible evolution of the starless cores within them. Observations were performed in various molecular transitions with APEX and Mopra. Five cores are gravitationally bound in Cha I and one in Cha III. The infall signature is seen toward 8-17 cores in Cha I and 2-5 cores in Cha III, which leads to a range of 13-28% of the cores in Cha I and 10-25% of the cores in Cha III that are contracting and may become prestellar. Future dynamical interactions between the cores will not be dynamically significant in either Cha I or III, but the subregion Cha I North may experience collisions between cores within ~0.7 Myr. Turbulence dissipation in the cores of both clouds is seen in the high-density tracers N2H 1-0 and HC3N 10-9. Evidence of depletion in the Cha I core interiors is seen in the abundance distributions of C17O, C18O, and C34S. Both contraction and static chemical models indicate that the HC3N to N2H abundance ratio is a good evolutionary indicator in the prestellar phase for both gravitationally bound and unbound cores. In the framework of these models, we find that the cores in Cha III and the southern part of Cha I are in a similar evolutionary stage and are less chemically evolved than the central region of Cha I. The measured HC3N/N2H abundance ratio and the evidence for contraction motions seen towards the Cha III starless cores suggest that Cha III is younger than Cha I Centre and that some of its cores may form stars in the future. The cores in Cha I South may on the other hand be transient structures. (abridged)",14,[],1
1404.2238,astro-ph,"In the presence of magnetic helicity, inverse transfer from small to large scales is well known in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence and has applications in astrophysics, cosmology, and fusion plasmas. Using high resolution direct numerical simulations of magnetically dominated self-similarly decaying MHD turbulence, we report a similar inverse transfer even in the absence of magnetic helicity. We compute for the first time spectral energy transfer rates to show that this inverse transfer is about half as strong as with helicity, but in both cases the magnetic gain at large scales results from velocity at similar scales interacting with smaller-scale magnetic fields. This suggests that both inverse transfers are a consequence of a universal mechanisms for magnetically dominated turbulence. Possible explanations include inverse cascading of the mean squared vector potential associated with local near two-dimensionality and the shallower equation subinertial range spectrum of kinetic energy forcing the magnetic field with a equation subinertial range to attain larger-scale coherence. The inertial range shows a clear equation spectrum and is the first example of fully isotropic magnetically dominated MHD turbulence exhibiting weak turbulence scaling.",14,['physics'],1
1409.4357,astro-ph,"Hot subdwarf stars of spectral type B (sdBs) are evolved, core helium-burning objects. The formation of those objects is puzzling, because the progenitor star has to lose almost its entire hydrogen envelope in the red-giant phase. Binary interactions have been invoked, but single sdBs exist as well. We report the discovery of two close hot subdwarf binaries with small radial velocity amplitudes. Follow-up photometry revealed reflection effects originating from cool irradiated companions, but no eclipses. The lower mass limits for the companions of CPD-64equation481 (equation) and PHL\,457 (equation) are significantly below the stellar mass limit. Hence they could be brown dwarfs unless the inclination is unfavourable. Two very similar systems have already been reported. The probability that none of them is a brown dwarf is very small, 0.02%. Hence we provide further evidence that substellar companions with masses that low are able to eject a common envelope and form an sdB star. Furthermore, we find that the properties of the observed sample of hot subdwarfs in reflection effect binaries is consistent with a scenario where single sdBs can still be formed via common envelope events, but their low-mass substellar companions do not survive.",14,[],1

However, the deuterium fractionation is in fact found to be enhanced, to different degrees, in cold, dark cores, hot cores around massive star forming regions, lukewarm cores, and warm cores (\it hereafter, hot corinos) around low-mass star forming regions. In this paper, we investigate the overall differences in the deuterium chemistry between hot cores and hot corinos. We have modelled the chemistry of dense gas around low-mass and massive star forming regions using a gas-grain chemical model. We investigate the influence of varying the core density, the depletion efficiency of gaseous species on to dust grains, the collapse mode and the final mass of the protostar on the chemical evolution of star forming regions. We find that the deuterium chemistry is, in general, most sensitive to variations of the depletion efficiency on to grain surfaces, in agreement with observations. In addition, the results showed that the chemistry is more sensitive to changes in the final density of the collapsing core in hot cores than in hot corinos. Finally, we find that ratios of deuterated sulphur bearing species in dense gas around hot cores and corinos may be good evolutionary indicators in a similar way as their non deuterated counterparts.",14,[],1

1410.6517,astro-ph,"In recent years much interest has been shown in the process of thermohaline mixing in red giants. In low and intermediate mass stars this mechanism first activates at the position of the bump in the luminosity function, and has been identified as a likely candidate for driving the slow mixing inferred to occur in these stars. One particularly important consequence of this process, which is driven by a molecular weight inversion, is the destruction of lithium. We show that the degree of lithium destruction, or in some cases production, is extremely sensitive to the numerical details of the stellar models. Within the standard 1D diffusion approximation to thermohaline mixing, we find that dfferent evolution codes, with their default numerical schemes, can produce lithium abundances that differ from one another by many orders of magnitude. This disagreement is worse for faster mixing. We perform experiments with four independent stellar evolution codes, and derive conditions for the spatial and temporal resolution required for a converged numerical solution. The results are extremely sensitive to the timesteps used. We find that predicted lithium abundances published in the literature until now should be treated with caution.",14,[],1

Such an analysis is performed here in the context of nonlinear resistive MHD for a generic time-dependent equilibrium representing a gradually forming current sheet. It is shown that two onset regimes, single-island and multi-island, are possible, depending on the rate of current sheet formation.

1401.7935,astro-ph,"Understanding the formation and evolution of the first stars and galaxies represents one of the most exciting frontiers in astronomy. Since the universe was filled with neutral hydrogen at early times, the most promising method for observing the epoch of the first stars is using the prominent 21-cm spectral line of the hydrogen atom. Current observational efforts are focused on the reionization era (cosmic age t~500 Myr), with earlier times considered much more challenging. However, the next frontier of even earlier galaxy formation (t~200 Myr) is emerging as a promising observational target. This is made possible by a recently noticed effect of a significant relative velocity between the baryons and dark matter at early times. The velocity difference significantly suppresses star formation. The spatial variation of this suppression enhances large-scale clustering and produces a prominent cosmic web on 100 comoving Mpc scales in the 21-cm intensity distribution. This structure makes it much more feasible for radio astronomers to detect these early stars, and should drive a new focus on this era, which is rich with little-explored astrophysics.",14,[],1

To this end we consider the gravitational field of the irregularly shaped body, as well as its electric and magnetic fields.

There also exist grains in the stable periodic orbits close to the cometary nucleus. The grains in the stable equibria or the stable periodic orbits will not escape or impact on the surface of the cometary nucleus.

1401.3513,astro-ph,"Short-lived intermittent phases of super-critical (super-Eddington) growth, coupled with star formation via positive feedback, may account for early growth of massive black holes (MBH) and coevolution with their host spheroids. We estimate the possible growth rates and duty cycles of these episodes, both assuming slim accretion disk solutions, and adopting the results of recent numerical simulations. The angular momentum of gas joining the accretion disk determines the length of the accretion episodes, and the final mass a MBH can reach. The latter can be related to the gas velocity dispersion, and in galaxies with low-angular momentum gas the MBH can get to a higher mass. When the host galaxy is able to sustain inflow rates at 1-100 msunyr, replenishing and circulation lead to a sequence of short (~1e4-1e7 years), heavily obscured accretion episodes that increase the growth rates, with respect to an Eddington-limited case, by several orders of magnitude. Our model predicts that the ratio of MBH accretion rate to star formation rate is 1e2 or higher, leading, at early epochs, to a ratio of MBH to stellar mass higher than the ""canonical"" value of ~1e-3, in agreement with current observations.

1403.1293,astro-ph,"Explaining the existence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) larger than equation at redshifts equation remains an open theoretical question. One possibility is that gas collapsing rapidly in pristine atomic cooling halos (equation) produces equation black holes. Previous studies have shown that the formation of such a black hole requires a strong UV background to prevent molecular hydrogen cooling and gas fragmentation. Recently it has been proposed that a high UV background may not be required for halos that accrete material extremely rapidly or for halos where gas cooling is delayed due to a high baryon-dark matter streaming velocity. In this work, we point out that building up a halo with equation before molecular cooling becomes efficient is not sufficient for forming a direct collapse black hole (DCBH). Though molecular hydrogen formation may be delayed, it will eventually form at high densities leading to efficient cooling and fragmentation. The only obvious way that molecular cooling could be avoided in the absence of strong UV radiation, is for gas to reach high enough density to cause collisional dissociation of molecular hydrogen (equation) before cooling occurs. However, we argue that the minimum core entropy, set by the entropy of the intergalactic medium (IGM) when it decouples from the CMB, prevents this from occurring for realistic halo masses. This is confirmed by hydrodynamical cosmological simulations without radiative cooling. We explain the maximum density versus halo mass in these simulations with simple entropy arguments. The low densities found suggest that DCBH formation indeed requires a strong UV background.",14,[],1

However, in the lower--mass clouds, they influence the morphologies of the HII regions by creating 10pc--scale central cavities.\\ The inhomogeneous structures of the model GMCs make them highly permeable to photons, ionized gas and supernova ejecta, and the leaking of ionized gas in particular strongly affects their evolution, reducing the effectiveness of feedback. Nevertheless, feedback is able to expel large fractions of the mass of the lower escape--velocity clouds. Its impact on star formation is more modest, decreasing final star formation efficiencies by 10--20equation, and the rate of change of the star formation efficiency per freefall time by about one third. However, the clouds still form stars substantially faster than observed GMCs.",14,[],1
1401.1837,astro-ph,"We consider the structure of the N(H I) - E(B-V) relationship when H I is measured in the 21 cm radio line and \EBV\ is defined by far-IR dust-derived measures. We derive reddening-dependent corrections to N(H I) based on interferometric absorption measurements over the past 30 years that follow a single power-law relationship equation\EBVequation at 0.02 equation \EBV\ equation 3 mag. Corrections to 21cm line-derived H I column densities are too small to have had any effect on the ratio N(H I)/\EBV\ equation magequation we derived at 0.015 equation \EBV\ equation 0.075 mag and \absb\ equation 20\degr; they are also too small to explain the break in the slope of the N(H I) - \EBV\ relation at \EBV\ equation 0.1 mag that we demonstrated around the Galaxy at \absb equation\degr. The latter must therefore be attributed to the onset of \HH-formation and we show that models of \HH\ formation in a low density diffuse molecular gas can readily explain the inflected N(H I)- \EBV\ relationship. Below \absb\ = 20\degr\ N(H I)/\EBV\ measured at 0.015 equation \EBV\ equation 0.075 mag increases steadily down to \absb\ = 8\degr\ where sightlines with small \EBV\ no longer occur.   By contrast, the ratio N(H I)/\EBV\ measured over all \EBV\ declines to N(H I)/\EBV\ equation magequation at \absb\ equation\degr, perhaps providing an explanation of the difference between our results and the gas/reddening ratios measured previously using stellar spectra.",14,[],1
1409.4486,astro-ph,"It is proposed that planetesimals perturbed by Jovian mean-motion resonances are the source of shock waves that form chondrules. It is considered that this shock-induced chondrule formation requires the velocity of the planetesimal relative to the gas disk to be on the order of > 7 km/s at 1 AU. In previous studies on planetesimal excitation, the effects of Jovian mean-motion resonance together with the gas drag were investigated, but the velocities obtained were at most 8 km/s in the asteroid belt, which is insufficient to account for the ubiquitous existence of chondrules. In this paper, we reexamine the effect of Jovian resonances and take into account the secular resonance in the asteroid belt caused by the gravity of the gas disk. We find that the velocities relative to the gas disk of planetesimals a few hundred kilometers in size exceed 12 km/s, and that this is achieved around the 3:1 mean-motion resonance. The heating region is restricted to a relatively narrow band between 1.5 AU and 3.5 AU. Our results suggest that chondrules were produced effectively in the asteroid region after Jovian formation. We also find that many planetesimals are scattered far beyond Neptune. Our findings can explain the presence of crystalline silicate in comets if the scattered planetesimals include silicate dust processed by shock heating.",14,[],1
1412.2900,astro-ph,"The question of the origin and evolution of magnetic fields in stars possessing a radiative envelope, like the A-type stars, is still regarded as a challenge for stellar physics. Those zones are likely to be differentially rotating, which suggests that strong interactions between differential rotation and magnetic fields could be at play. We numerically compute the joint evolution of the magnetic and velocity fields in a 3D spherical shell starting from an initial profile for the poloidal magnetic field and differential rotation. The poloidal magnetic field is initially wound-up by the differential rotation to produce a toroidal field which becomes unstable. In the particular setup studied here where the differential rotation is dominant, the magneto-rotational instability is triggered. The growth rate of the instability depends mainly on the initial rotation rate, while the background state typically oscillates over a poloidal Alfv\'en time. We thus find that the axisymmetric magnetic configuration is strongly modified by the instability only if the ratio between the poloidal Alfv\'en frequency and the rotation rate is sufficiently small. An enhanced transport of angular momentum is found in the most unstable cases: the typical time to flatten the rotation profile is then much faster than the diffusion time scale. We conclude that the magneto-rotational instability is always favored (over the Tayler instability) in unstratified spherical shells when an initial poloidal field is sheared by a sufficiently strong cylindrical differential rotation. A possible application to the magnetic desert observed among A stars is given. We argue that the dichotomy between stars exhibiting strong axisymmetric fields (Ap stars) and those harboring a sub-Gauss magnetism could be linked to the threshold for the instability.",14,[],1

Here, we present the detailed optical data over a broad wavelength range to probe the spatially-resolved kinematics and stellar populations of the stars. We use the Pegase.HR model with the ELODIE v3.1 stellar library to determine the star formation histories of the galaxies using full spectrum fitting. We perform single stellar population (SSP) as well as composite stellar population (CSP) fits to account for more complex star formation histories.

1403.4525,astro-ph,"This paper introduces a new empirical model for the rotational evolution of Sun-like stars -- those with surface convection zones and non-convective interior regions. Previous models do not match the morphology of observed (rotation period)-color diagrams, notably the existence of a relatively long-lived ""C-sequence"" of fast rotators first identified by Barnes(2003). This failure motivates the Metastable Dynamo Model (MDM) described here. The MDM posits that stars are born with their magnetic dynamos operating in a mode that couples very weakly to the stellar wind, so their (initially very short) rotation periods at first change little with time. At some point, this mode spontaneously and randomly changes to a strongly-coupled mode, the transition occurring with a mass-dependent lifetime that is of order 100 MYr. I show that with this assumption, one can obtain good fits to observations of young clusters, particularly for ages of 150 MYr to 200 MYr. Previous models and the MDM both give qualitative agreement with the morphology of the slower-rotating ""I-sequence"" stars, but none of them have been shown to accurately reproduce the stellar-mass-dependent evolution of the I-sequence stars, especially for clusters older than a few hundred MYr. I discuss observational experiments that can test aspects of the MDM, and speculate that the physics underlying the MDM may be related to other situations described in the literature, in which stellar dynamos may have a multi-modal character.",14,[],1
1406.2872,astro-ph,"Herschel Space Observatory photometry and extensive multiwavelength followup have revealed that the powerful radio galaxy 3C 220.3 at z=0.685 acts as a gravitational lens for a background submillimeter galaxy (SMG) at z=2.221. At an observed wavelength of 1mm, the SMG is lensed into three distinct images. In the observed near infrared, these images are connected by an arc of 1.8"" radius forming an Einstein half-ring centered near the radio galaxy. In visible light, only the arc is apparent. 3C 220.3 is the only known instance of strong galaxy-scale lensing by a powerful radio galaxy not located in a galaxy cluster and therefore it offers the potential to probe the dark matter content of the radio galaxy host. Lens modeling rejects a single lens, but two lenses centered on the radio galaxy host A and a companion B, separated by 1.5"", provide a fit consistent with all data and reveal faint candidates for the predicted fourth and fifth images. The model does not require an extended common dark matter halo, consistent with the absence of extended bright X-ray emission on our Chandra image. The projected dark matter fractions within the Einstein radii of A (1.02"") and B (0.61"") are about 0.4 /- 0.3 and 0.55 /- 0.3. The mass to i-band light ratios of A and B, M/L ~ 8 /- 4 Msun/Lsun, appear comparable to those of radio-quiet lensing galaxies at the same redshift in the CASTLES, LSD, and SL2S samples. The lensed SMG is extremely bright with observed f(250um) = 440mJy owing to a magnification factor mu~10. The SMG spectrum shows luminous, narrow CIV 154.9nm emission, revealing that the SMG houses a hidden quasar in addition to a violent starburst. Multicolor image reconstruction of the SMG indicates a bipolar morphology of the emitted ultraviolet (UV) light suggestive of cones through which UV light escapes a dust-enshrouded nucleus.",14,[],1
1410.8514,astro-ph,"Observations have shown that supermassive black holes in nearby elliptical galaxies correlate tightly with the stellar velocity dispersion (the equation relation) and the stellar mass (the equation relation) of their host spheroids. However, the origin of these correlations remains ambiguous. In a previous paper by Zhu et al., we proposed a model which links the M-equation relation to the the dynamical state of the system and the equation relation to the self-regulation of galaxy growth. To test this model, we compile a sample of observed galaxies with different properties and examine the dependence of the above correlations on these parameters. We find that galaxies that satisfy the the equation correlation appear to have reached virial equilibrium, as indicated by the ratio between kinetic energy and gravitational potential, 2K/U equation 1. Furthermore, the ratio of black hole accretion rate to star formation rate remains nearly constant, BHAR /SFR equation equation, in active galaxies over a wide range of mass in the redshift range z=0 - 3. These results confirm our theoretical model that the observed correlations have different origins: the equation relation may result from galaxy relaxation, while the equation - equation relation may be due to self-regulated black hole accretion and star formation in galaxies.",14,[],1

Analyses of such measurements are usually performed within the context of the so-called vanilla LCDM model - the six-parameter phenomenological model which, for instance, emerges from best fits against the recent data obtained by the Planck satellite. Here, we show that such an approach is prone to subtle systematics when the Gaussianity of primordial fluctuations is concerned. In particular, we demonstrate that, if we neglect even a tiny amount of primordial non-Gaussianity - fully consistent with current limits - we shall introduce spurious biases in the reconstruction of cosmological parameters. This is a serious issue that must be properly accounted for in view of accurate (as well as precise) cosmology.",14,[],1

Using HST/STIS optical coronagraphy, we have completed the observational phase of a program to study the spatial distribution of dust in ten CS debris systems, and one ""mature"" protoplanetrary disk all with HST pedigree, using PSF-subtracted multi-roll coronagraphy. These observations probe stellocentric distances > 5 AU for the nearest stars, and simultaneously resolve disk substructures well beyond, corresponding to the giant planet and Kuiper belt regions in our Solar System. They also disclose diffuse very low-surface brightness dust at larger stellocentric distances. We present new results inclusive of fainter disks such as HD92945 confirming, and better revealing, the existence of a narrow inner debris ring within a larger diffuse dust disk. Other disks with ring-like sub-structures, significant asymmetries and complex morphologies include: HD181327 with a posited spray of ejecta from a recent massive collision in an exo-Kuiper belt; HD61005 suggested interacting with the local ISM; HD15115 & HD32297, discussed also in the context of environmental interactions.

1403.0092,astro-ph,"We used the UltraViolet-Optical Telescope on board Swift to observe the dynamically young comet C/2009 P1 (Garradd) from a heliocentric distance of 3.5 AU pre-perihelion until 4.0 AU outbound. At 3.5 AU pre-perihelion, comet Garradd had one of the highest dust-to-gas ratios ever observed, matched only by comet Hale-Bopp. The evolving morphology of the dust in its coma suggests an outburst that ended around 2.2 AU pre-perihelion. Comparing slit-based measurements and observations acquired with larger fields of view indicated that between 3 AU and 2 AU pre-perihelion a significant extended source started producing water in the coma. We demonstrate that this source, which could be due to icy grains, disappeared quickly around perihelion. Water production by the nucleus may be attributed to a constantly active source of at least 75 kmequation, estimated to be more than 20 percent of the surface. Based on our measurements, the comet lost equation kg of ice and dust during this apparition, corresponding to at most a few meters of its surface.Even though this was likely not Garradd's first passage through the inner solar system, the activity of the comet was complex and changed significantly during the time it was observed.",14,[],1
1402.3296,astro-ph,"We make use of a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation to investigate the origin of the observed correlation between [a/Fe] abundance ratios and stellar mass in elliptical galaxies. We implement a new galaxy-wide stellar initial mass function (Top Heavy Integrated Galaxy Initial Mass Function, TH-IGIMF) in the semi-analytic model SAG and evaluate its impact on the chemical evolution of galaxies. The SFR-dependence of the slope of the TH-IGIMF is found to be key to reproducing the correct [a/Fe]-stellar mass relation. Massive galaxies reach higher [a/Fe] abundance ratios because they are characterized by more top-heavy IMFs as a result of their higher SFR. As a consequence of our analysis, the value of the minimum embedded star cluster mass and of the slope of the embedded cluster mass function, which are free parameters involved in the TH-IGIMF theory, are found to be as low as 5 solar masses and 2, respectively. A mild downsizing trend is present for galaxies generated assuming either a universal IMF or a variable TH-IGIMF. We find that, regardless of galaxy mass, older galaxies (with formation redshifts > 2) are formed in shorter time-scales (< 2 Gyr), thus achieving larger [a/Fe] values. Hence, the time-scale of galaxy formation alone cannot explain the slope of the [a/Fe]-galaxy mass relation, but is responsible for the big dispersion of [a/Fe] abundance ratios at fixed stellar mass.We further test the hyphothesis of a TH-IGIMF in elliptical galaxies by looking into mass-to-light ratios, and luminosity functions. Models with a TH-IGIMF are also favoured by these constraints. In particular, mass-to-light ratios agree with observed values for massive galaxies while being overpredicted for less massive ones; this overprediction is present regardless of the IMF considered.",14,[],1
1409.3848,astro-ph,"We run controlled N-body experiments to study the evolution of the dark matter (DM) halo profiles of dwarf galaxies driven by the accretion of DM substructures. Our initial conditions assume that supernova feedback erases the primordial DM cusps of haloes with equation at equation. The orbits and masses of the infalling substructures are borrowed from the \it Aquarius simulations. Our experiments show that a fraction of haloes that undergo 1:3 down to 1:30 mergers are susceptible to reform a DM cusp by equation. Cusp regrowth is driven the accretion of DM substructures that are dense enough reach the central regions of the main halo before being tidally disrupted. The infall of substructures with a mass ratio above 1:6 on the mean of the reported mass-concentration relation systematically lead to cusp regrowth. Between 1:6 to 1:8, and 1:8 to 1:30 substructures need to be located one and two-sigma above the mean, respectively. The merging timescales of these dense, low-mass substructures is relatively long equation, which may pose a timescale problem for the longevity of DM cores in dwarf galaxies. These results suggest that a certain level of scatter in the central density slopes of galactic haloes acted-on by feedback is to be expected given the stochastic mass accretion histories of low-mass haloes and the diverse star formation histories observed in the Local Group dwarves.",14,[],1

Despite many efforts the origin of such a feature of the spectrum is not satisfactorily solved yet. Here it is proposed that the steepening of the spectrum beyond the knee may be a consequence of mass distribution of progenitor of cosmic ray source. The proposed speculative model can account all the major observed features about cosmic rays without invoking any fine tuning to match flux or spectra at any energy point. The prediction of the proposed model regarding primary composition scenario beyond the knee is quite different from most of the prevailing models of the knee and thereby can be discriminated from precise experimental measurement of the primary composition.,14,[],1

We use Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) and white-light coronagraph observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the twin Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory spacecraft (STEREO-A and STEREO-B) to determine the angular extent of the EUV wave and coronal mass ejection (CME) associated with the origin of the SEP event. We compare the estimated release time of SEPs observed at each spacecraft with the arrival time of the structures associated with the CME at the footpoints of the field lines connecting each spacecraft with the Sun. Whereas the arrival of the EUV wave and CME-driven shock at the footpoint of STEREO-B is consistent, within uncertainties, with the release time of the particles observed by this spacecraft, the EUV wave never reached the footpoint of the field lines connecting near-Earth observers with the Sun, even though an intense SEP event was observed there. We show that the west flank of the CME-driven shock propagating at high altitudes above the solar surface was most likely the source of the particles observed near Earth, but it did not leave any EUV trace on the solar disk. We conclude that the angular extent of the EUV wave on the solar surface did not agree with the longitudinal extent of the SEP event in the heliosphere.

1401.6866,cond-mat,"Using a coarse-grained bead-spring model for semi-flexible macromolecules forming a polymer brush, structure and dynamics of the polymers is investigated, varying chain stiffness and grafting density. The anchoring condition for the grafted chains is chosen such that their first bonds are oriented along the normal to the substrate plane.   Compression of such a semi-flexible brush by a planar piston is observed to be a two-stage process: for small compressions the chains contract by ""buckling"" deformation whereas for larger compression the chains exhibit a collective (almost uniform) bending deformation. Thus, the stiff polymer brush undergoes a 2-nd order phase transition of collective bond reorientation. The pressure, required to keep the stiff brush at a given degree of compression, is thereby significantly smaller than for an otherwise identical brush made of entirely flexible polymer chains! While both the brush height and the chain linear dimension in the z-direction perpendicular to the substrate increase monotonically with increasing chain stiffness, lateral (xy) chain linear dimensions exhibit a maximum at intermediate chain stiffness. Increasing the grafting density leads to a strong decrease of these lateral dimensions, compatible with an exponential decay. Also the recovery kinetics after removal of the compressing piston is studied, and found to follow a power-law / exponential decay with time.   A simple mean-field theoretical consideration, accounting for the buckling/bending behavior of semi-flexible polymer brushes under compression, is suggested.",14,[],8

Here we predict that in a much broader class of quantum-dot systems with spin larger than one-half, superparamagnetism may arise without spin-orbit interaction: by attaching ferromagnets a spintronic exchange field of quadrupolar nature is generated locally. It can be observed in conductance measurements and surprisingly leads to enhanced spin filtering even in a state with zero average spin.

1404.7485,cond-mat,"Nano-particle agglomeration plays an important role in processes such as spray drying and particle flame synthesis. These processes have in common that nano-particles collide at low concentrations and get irreversibly linked at the point of contact due to plastic deformation. In this paper, we investigate several models of irreversible connections, which require only local interactions between the colliding nano-particles and thus allow for scalable simulations. The models investigated here connect the particles upon collision by non-bonded strongly attractive interactions, bonded interactions or by binding agents placed at the point of contact. Models using spherically symmetric interactions form compact agglomerates and are therefore unsuitable to study agglomeration. In contrast, models that are either based on both central and angular potentials (type one) or on binding agents (type two) efficiently prevent restructuring of the agglomerates, and are therefore useful for modeling contacts formed by plastic deformation. Moreover, both types of models allow to control the rigidity and by that the degree of restructuring. The first type of model is computationally more efficient at low fractional dimensions of the aggregates, while the second gives easy access to local shear forces, which is important when breaking of agglomerates is to be considered. As example applications, we reproduce the well-known diffusion-limited agglomeration (DLA) and report results on soot aggregation.",14,[],8

We attempt to account for both contributions by deriving an interfacial Hamiltonian, characterised by a wavevector dependent surface tension equation, and then reconstructing density correlations from correlations in the interface position. We show that the standard crossing criterion identification of the interface, as a surface of fixed density (or magnetization), does not explain the separation of equation and the form of the excess contribution. We propose an alternative definition of the interface position based on the properties of correlations between points that ""float"" with the surface and show that this describes the full equation and equation dependence of the excess contributions to both equation and equation.

Using both simulations and qualitative arguments, we show that, when the separation between swimmers is comparable to their size, the swimmers' motions are strongly affected by activity-induced hydrodynamic forces. To further understand these effects, we investigate semidilute suspensions of swimmers in the presence of thermal fluctuations. A direct comparison between simulations with and without hydrodynamic interactions shows these to enhance the dynamic clustering at a relatively small volume fraction; with our chosen model the key ingredient for this clustering behavior is hydrodynamic trapping of one swimmer by another, induced by the active forces. Furthermore, the density dependence of the motility (of both the translational and rotational motions) exhibits distinctly different behaviors with and without hydrodynamic interactions; we argue that this is linked to the clustering tendency. Our study illustrates the fact that hydrodynamic interactions not only affect kinetic pathways in active suspensions, but also cause major changes in their steady state properties.",14,[],8

Negative magnetoresistance detected at T < 25 K is found to be due to a tunneling of spin-polarized electrons between ferromagnetic clusters. A linear positive magnetoresistance is identified to be geometrical effect related with the presence of ferromagnetic clusters inside semiconductor matrix. The product of the polarization constant and the inter-grain exchange constant, JP, varies between about 0.13 meV and 0.99 meV. Strong anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is observed for T < TC with coefficients RS independent of temperature. The scaling analysis of the AHE leads to a conclusion that this effect is due to a skew scattering mechanism.",14,[],8

1407.3564,cond-mat,"Densely packed systems of thermal particles in curved geometries are frequently encountered in biological and microfluidic systems. In 2D systems, at sufficiently high surface coverage, diffusive motion is widely known to be strongly affected by physical confinement, e.g., by the walls. In this Letter, we explore the effects of confinement by shape, not rigid boundaries, on the diffusion of particles by confining them to the surface of a cylinder. We find that both the magnitude and the directionality of lateral diffusion is strongly influenced by the radius of the cylinder. An anisotropy between diffusion in the longitudinal and circumferential direction of the cylinder develops. We demonstrate that the origin of this effect lies in the fact that screw-like packings of mono- and oligodisperse discs on the surface of a cylinder induce preferential collective motions in the circumferential direction, but also show that even in polydisperse systems lacking such order an intrinsic finite size confinement effect increases diffusivity in the circumferential direction.",14,[],8
1409.8538,cond-mat,"We have measured circularly polarized photoluminescence in monolayer MoSe2 under perpendicular magnetic fields up to 10 T. At low doping densities, the neutral and charged excitons shift linearly with field strength at a rate of equation 0.12 meV/T for emission arising, respectively, from the K and K' valleys. The opposite sign for emission from different valleys demonstrates lifting of the valley degeneracy. The magnitude of the Zeeman shift agrees with predicted magnetic moments for carriers in the conduction and valence bands. The relative intensity of neutral and charged exciton emission is modified by the magnetic field, reflecting the creation of field-induced valley polarization. At high doping levels, the Zeeman shift of the charged exciton increases to equation 0.18 meV/T. This enhancement is attributed to many-body effects on the binding energy of the charged excitons.",14,[],8
1406.3744,cond-mat,"We use muon spin relaxation (muSR) to investigate the magnetic properties of a bulk form diluted ferromagnetic semiconductor (DFS) Li1.15(Zn0.9Mn0.1)P with TC ~ 22 K. MuSR results confirm the gradual development of ferromagnetic ordering below TC with a nearly 100% magnetic ordered volume. Despite its low carrier density, the relation between static internal field and Curie temperature observed for Li(Zn,Mn)P is consistent with the trend found in (Ga,Mn)As and other bulk DFSs, indicating these systems share a common mechanism for the ferromagnetic exchange interaction. Li1y(Zn1-xMnx)P has the advantage of decoupled carrier and spin doping, where Mn2 substitution for Zn2 introduces spins and Li off-stoichiometry provides carriers. This advantage enables us to investigate the influence of overdoped Li on the ferromagnetic ordered state. Overdoping Li suppresses both TC and saturation moments for a certain amount of spins, which indicates that more carriers are detrimental to the ferromagnetic exchange interaction, and that a delicate balance between charge and spin densities is required to achieve highest TC.",14,[],8

We explore the emergence of the giant mutually connected component, generalizing the percolation cluster in a single network to interdependent networks, and observe the strong effect of loops of interdependencies. In particular, we find that the giant mutual component does not emerge in a loop formed by any number of layers. In contrast, we observe multiple hybrid transitions in networks of networks formed by infinite number of randomly connected layers, corresponding to the percolation of layers with different number of interdependencies. In particular we find that layers with many interdependencies are more fragile than layers with less interdependencies. These hybrid transitions, combining a discontinuity and a singularity, are responsible for joining a finite fraction of nodes in different layers to the giant mutually connected component. In the case of partial interdependence, when only a fraction of interlinks between layers provide interdependence, some of these transitions can become continuous.",14,['physics'],8

This is realized by loading a rubidium atomic Bose-Einstein condensate into a periodic optical potential subjected to a biharmonic temporal drive. The achieved long-time coherence allows us to resolve resonance enhancement of the atom transport induced by avoided crossings in the Floquet spectrum of the system.

In the partially disordered state, we show that the magnetic transition is associated with the charge-gap formation. We find that the density of state shows characteristic peaks reflecting the underlying spin texture. In the loop-liquid state, we also find a peak in a different manner in the density of states as well as in the optical conductivity. This is a consequence of the formation of closed loops of the same spin sites in the loop-liquid state.

We present the theoretical justification of the method and its verification based on simulated images in the case of low-order anti-symmetric aberrations. Ultimately the method is applied to experimental hardware aberration-corrected HRTEM images of single-layer graphene and MoSe2 resulting in images with strongly reduced residual low-order aberrations, and consequently improved interpretability.

1407.6994,cond-mat,"This paper is a continuation of a recent one in which, apparently for the first time, the existence of polaritons in ionic crystals was proven in a microscopic electrodynamic theory. This was obtained through an explicit computation of the dispersion curves. Here the main further contribution consists in studying electric susceptibility, from which the spectrum can be inferred. We show how susceptibility is obtained by the Green--Kubo methods of Hamiltonian statistical mechanics, and give for it a concrete expression in terms of time--correlation functions. As in the previous paper, here too we work in a completely classical framework, in which the electrodynamic forces acting on the charges are all taken into account, both the retarded forces and the radiation reaction ones. So, in order to apply the methods of statistical mechanics, the system has to be previously reduced to a Hamiltonian one. This is made possible in virtue of two global properties of classical electrodynamics, namely, the Wheeler--Feynman identity and the Ewald resummation properties, the proofs of which were already given for ordered system. The second contribution consists in formulating the theory in a completely general way, so that in principle it applies also to disordered systems such as glasses, or liquids or gases, provided the two general properties mentioned above continue to hold. A first step in this direction is made here by providing a completely general proof of the Wheeler--Feynman identity, which is shown to be the counterpart of a general causality property of classical electrodynamics. Finally it is shown how a line spectrum can appear at all in classical systems, as a counterpart of suitable stability properties of the motions, with a broadening due to a coexistence of chaoticity.",14,['physics'],8

Yet in the transition region around equation, hybrid vortices between these two characteristics appear. Only in this region around equation and for magnetic fields well aligned with the FeAs layers, we observe oscillations of the c-axis critical current equation periodic in equation due to a delicate balance of intervortex forces and interaction with the layered potential. equation shows pronounced maxima when a hexagonal vortex lattice is commensurate with the crystal structure.

Here we show that several key features of the experimental data can be understood in terms weak spin-orbit interactions naturally present in bilayer systems, whose primary effect is to cause the magnetic breakdown to be accompanied by a spin flip. These features can now be understood include the equidistant set of three quantum oscillation frequencies, the asymmetry of the quantum oscillation amplitudes in c-axis transport compared to ab-plane transport, and the anomalous magnetic field angle dependence of the amplitude of side frequencies suggestive of small effective g-factors.

Differently from photoluminescence, electroluminescence requires an electrical current flowing through the diamond sub-gap states for the excitation of the colour centres. With this purpose, buried graphitic electrodes with a spacing of 10 micrometers were fabricated in the bulk of a detector-grade CVD single-crystal diamond sample using a scanning 1.8 MeV He micro-beam. The current flowing in the gap region between the electrodes upon the application of a 250 V bias voltage was exploited as the excitation pump for the electroluminescence of different types of colour centres localized in the above-mentioned gap.

It is remarkable that, though these compounds have crystalline cubic-structure, they exhibit glass-like phonon thermal conductivity over the whole temperature range depending on the states of rattling guest atoms in the tetrakaidecahedron. In addition, these compounds show unusual glass-like specific heats and THz-frequency phonon dynamics, providing a remarkable broad peak almost identical to those observed in topologically disordered amorphous materials or structural glasses, the so-called Boson peak. An efficient thermoelectric effect is realized in compounds showing these glass-like characteristics. This decade, a number of experimental works dealing with type-I clathrate compounds have been published. These are diffraction experiments, thermal and spectroscopic experiments in addition to those based on heat and electronic transport. These form the raw materials for this article based on advances this decade. The subject of this article involves interesting phenomena from the viewpoint of not only physics but also from the view point of the practical problem of elaborating efficient thermoelectric materials. This review presents a survey of a wide range of experimental investigations of type-I clathrate compounds, together with a review of theoretical interpretations of the peculiar thermal and dynamic properties observed in these materials.",14,[],8

When we evaluate the nearest-neighbor level-spacing distribution equation of eigenenergies of the present oscillator system, we observe the transition of equation from the Poisson to the Wigner distribution with the increase of cubic anharmonicity, showing the occurrence of chaos in the anharmonic Jahn-Teller vibration. The energy scale of the chaotic region is specified from the analysis of equation and we discuss a possible way to observe chaotic behavior in the experiment of specific heat. It is an intriguing possibility that chaos in nonlinear physics could be detected by a standard experiment in condensed matter physics.",14,['nlin'],8

1407.4239,cond-mat,"Correlation and spectral analysis represent the standard tools to study interdependence in statistical data. However, for the stochastic processes with heavy-tailed distributions such that the variance diverges, these tools are inadequate. The heavy-tailed processes are ubiquitous in nature and finance. We here discuss codifference as a convenient measure to study statistical interdependence, and we aim to give a short introductory review of its properties. By taking different known stochastic processes as generic examples, we present explicit formulas for their codifferences. We show that for the Gaussian processes codifference is equivalent to covariance. For processes with finite variance these two measures behave similarly with time. For the processes with infinite variance the covariance does not exist, however, the codifference is relevant. We demonstrate the practical importance of the codifference by extracting this function from simulated as well as from real experimental data. We conclude that the codifference serves as a convenient practical tool to study interdependence for stochastic processes with both infinite and finite variances as well.",14,[],8

The HNL has a three-dimensionally-continuous sponge-like structure with a pore size of a few tens of nm at its apparent surface. The pore size gradually decreases from the apparent surface to the interface of the porous layer and the bulk substrate. This HNL gives two significant properties to glass: (1) higher optical transparency than untreated glass by 7% for all over the visible light. (2) long persistent superhydrophilicity with a water contact angle of 5 degree for more than 140 days. The superhydrophilicity also realizes anti-fogging and anti-fouling functionalities.,14,[],8
1409.3652,cond-mat,"We propose a magnetization reversal model to explain the perpendicular switching of a single ferromagnetic layer induced by an in-plane current. Contrary to previously proposed reversal mechanisms that such magnetic switching is directly from the Rashba or spin Hall effects, we suggest that this type of switching arises from the current-induced chirality dependent domain wall motion. By measuring the field dependent switching behaviors, we show that such switching can also be achieved between any two multidomain states, and all of these switching behaviors can be well explained by this model. This model indicates that the spin Hall angle in such structures may be overestimated and also predicts similar switching behaviors in other ferromagnetic structures with chiral domain walls or skyrmions.",14,[],8
1410.5412,cond-mat,"Motivated by a recent experiment in which zero-bias peaks have been observed in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments performed on chains of magnetic atoms on a superconductor, we show, by generalizing earlier work, that a multichannel ferromagnetic wire deposited on a spin-orbit coupled superconducting substrate can realize a non-trivial chiral topological superconducting state with Majorana bound states localized at the wire ends. The non-trivial topological state occurs for generic parameters requiring no fine tuning, at least for very large exchange spin splitting in the wire. We theoretically obtain the signatures which appear in the presence of an arbitrary number of Majorana modes in multi-wire systems incorporating the role of finite temperature, finite potential barrier at the STM tip, and finite wire length. These signatures are presented in terms of spatial profiles of STM differential conductance which clearly reveal zero energy Majorana end modes and the prediction of a multiple Majorana based fractional Josephson effect. A substantial part of this work is devoted to a detailed critical comparison between our theory and the recent STM experiment claiming the observation of Majorana fermions. The conclusion of this detailed comparison is that although the experimental observations are not manifestly inconsistent with our theoretical findings, the very small topological superconducting gap and the very high temperature of the experiment make it impossible to decisively verify the existence of a localized Majorana zero mode, as the spectral weight of the Majorana mode is necessarily spread over a very broad energy regime exceeding the size of the gap. Thus, although the experimental findings are indeed consistent with a highly broadened and weakened Majorana zero bias peak, much lower experimental temperatures are necessary for any definitive conclusion.",14,[],8

A low-momentum expansion up to the fourth order of the quadratic action of the fluctuating pairing field gives an ultraviolent divergent contribution of the Gaussian fluctuations to the grand potential. Performing dimensional regularization we evaluate the effective coupling constant in the beyond-mean-field grand potential. Remarkably, in the BEC regime our grand potential gives exactly the Popov's equation of state of 2D interacting bosons, and allows us to identify the scattering length equation of the interaction between composite bosons as equation, with equation is the scattering length of fermions. Remarkably, the value from our analytical relationship between the two scattering lengths is in full agreement with that obtained by recent Monte Carlo calculations.",14,[],8
1409.4307,cond-mat,Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between two dyes acriflavine (Acf) and rhodamine B (RhB) were investigated in solution and Layer-by-Layer (LbL) self assembled films in presence and absence of clay mineral laponite. UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy studies suggest both the dyes present mainly as monomer in solution and films. Energy transfer occurred from Acf to RhB in solution and LbL films. The energy transfer efficiency increases in presence of clay laponite and the maximum efficiency were 78.17% and 32.54% in clay dispersion and in LbL films respectively. Presence of laponite particles onto LbL film was confirmed by atomic force microscopy investigations with a surface coverage of more than 75%. Energy transfer efficiency was pH sensitive and the energy transfer efficiency varies from 4.5% to 44.45% in mixed dye solution for a change in pH from 3.0 to 12.0.

We observe characteristics typical of the spin Seebeck effect, although we do not observe a change of sign of the voltage at the Pt strip when it is moved from hot to cold side, which is believed to be the most striking feature of the transverse spin Seebeck effect. Therefore, we relate the observed voltages to the longitudinal spin Seebeck effect generated by a parasitic out-of-plane temperature gradient, which can be simulated by contact tips of different material and heat conductivities and by tip heating. This work gives new insights into the interpretation of transverse spin Seebeck effect experiments, which are still under discussion.",14,[],8

In this system, two graphene layers are separated by hexagonal boron-nitride (h-BN) layers which work as a insulating barrier. Our results show that the stability of the system is determined by the atomistic configurations between graphene and its adjacent h-BN layer. Among different stacking sequences, Ab-stacking is most stable. Since the inserted h-BN layers modulate the on-site energies for carbon atoms of graphene layers, the electronic states of the system can be classified into metallic or semiconducting by the stacking sequence. And the stacking sequence dependence of the energy band structures of DLGHs are well described by the orbital interaction model.",14,[],8

1411.7375,cond-mat,We investigate localization properties in a family of deterministic (i.e. no disorder) nearest neighbor tight binding models with quasiperiodic onsite modulation. We prove that this family is self-dual under a generalized duality transformation. The self-dual condition for this general model turns out to be a simple closed form function of the model parameters and energy. We introduce the typical density of states as an order parameter for localization in quasiperiodic systems. By direct calculations of the inverse participation ratio and the typical density of states we numerically verify that this self-dual line indeed defines a mobility edge in energy separating localized and extended states. Our model is a first example of a nearest neighbor tight binding model manifesting a mobility edge protected by a duality symmetry. We propose a realistic experimental scheme to realize our results in atomic optical lattices and photonic waveguides.,14,[],8
1409.3996,cond-mat,We present results on the radiative lifetimes of excitons and trions in a monolayer of metal dichalcogenide MoS2. The small exciton radius and the large exciton optical oscillator strength result in radiative lifetimes in the 0.18-0.30 ps range for excitons that have small in-plane momenta and couple to radiation. Average lifetimes of thermally distributed excitons depend linearly on the exciton temperature and can be in the few picoseconds range at small temperatures and more than a nanosecond near room temperature. Localized excitons exhibit lifetimes in the same range and the lifetime increases as the localization length decreases. The radiative lifetimes of trions are in the hundreds of picosecond range and increase with the increase in the trion momentum. Average lifetimes of thermally distributed trions increase with the trion temperature as the trions acquire thermal energy and larger momenta. We expect our theoretical results to be applicable to most other 2D transition metal dichalcogenides.,14,[],8

1405.1011,cond-mat,"We calculate the differential conductance as a function of temperature and bias voltage, equation, through Au monoatomic chains with a substitutional Co atom as a magnetic impurity, connected to a four-fold symmetric lead. The system was recently proposed as a possible scenario for observation of the overscreened Kondo physics. Stretching the chain, the system could be tuned through a quantum critical point (QCP) with three different regimes, overscreened, underscreened and non Kondo phases. We present calculations of the impurity spectral function by using the numerical renormalization group (NRG) for the three different regimes characterizing the QCP. Non trivial behaviour of the spectral function is reported near the QCP. Comparison with results using the non crossing approximation (NCA), shows that the latter is reliable in the overscreened regime, when the anisotropy is larger than the Kondo temperature. For these parameters, which correspond to realistic previous estimates, equation calculated within NCA exhibits clear signatures of the non-Fermi liquid behaviour within the overscreened regime.",14,[],8

This leads to Fermi surface reconstruction and profoundly changes the electronic structure. Here we extend previous work to consider the shift in critical temperature on equationO to equationO substitution, The isotope effect has been found experimentally to be very small at optimal doping yet to rapidly increase to very large values with underdoping. The YRZ model provides a natural explanation of this behavior and supports the idea of a pairing mechanism which is mainly spin fluctuations with a subdominant equation phonon contribution.",14,[],8
1410.0987,cond-mat,"We theoretically investigate the superfluid density and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition of a two-dimensional Rashba spin-orbit coupled atomic Fermi gas with both in-plane and out-of-plane Zeeman fields. It was recently predicted that, by tuning the two Zeeman fields, the system may exhibit different exotic Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superfluid phases, including the gapped FF, gapless FF, gapless topological FF and gapped topological FF states. Due to the FF paring, we show that the superfluid density (tensor) of the system becomes anisotropic. When an in-plane Zeeman field is applied along the \textitx-direction, the tensor component along the \textity-direction equation is generally larger than equation in most parameter space. At zero temperature, there is always a discontinuity jump in equation as the system evolves from a gapped FF into a gapless FF state. With increasing temperature, such a jump is gradually washed out. The critical BKT temperature has been calculated as functions of the spin-orbit coupling strength, interatomic interaction strength, in-plane and out-of-plane Zeeman fields. We predict that the novel FF superfluid phases have a significant critical BKT temperature, typically at the order of equation, where equation is the Fermi degenerate temperature.

1401.1191,cs,"Wireless sensor networks are often designed to perform two tasks: sensing a physical field and transmitting the data to end-users. A crucial aspect of the design of a WSN is the minimization of the overall energy consumption. Previous researchers aim at optimizing the energy spent for the communication, while mostly ignoring the energy cost due to sensing. Recently, it has been shown that considering the sensing energy cost can be beneficial for further improving the overall energy efficiency. More precisely, sparse sensing techniques were proposed to reduce the amount of collected samples and recover the missing data by using data statistics. While the majority of these techniques use fixed or random sampling patterns, we propose to adaptively learn the signal model from the measurements and use the model to schedule when and where to sample the physical field. The proposed method requires minimal on-board computation, no inter-node communications and still achieves appealing reconstruction performance.

With the assumption that multi-BS UE (user being served by multi-BS) would require the same amount of spectrum from these BSs, we conclude that when the number of multi-BS UEs is limited by M-1, the resource allocation scheme can always guarantee the minimum overall transmit power consumption while meeting the throughput requirement of each UE and also each BS's power constraint. Then, to decide the clusters of multi-BS UEs and the clusters of individual-BS UEs (users being served by individual BSs), we propose a UE-BS association scheme and a complexity reduction scheme.

1410.6629,cs,"One of the ways in which attackers try to steal sensitive information from corporations is by sending spearphishing emails. This type of emails typically appear to be sent by one of the victim's coworkers, but have instead been crafted by an attacker. A particularly insidious type of spearphishing emails are the ones that do not only claim to come from a trusted party, but were actually sent from that party's legitimate email account that was compromised in the first place. In this paper, we propose a radical change of focus in the techniques used for detecting such malicious emails: instead of looking for particular features that are indicative of attack emails, we look for possible indicators of impersonation of the legitimate owners. We present IdentityMailer, a system that validates the authorship of emails by learning the typical email-sending behavior of users over time, and comparing any subsequent email sent from their accounts against this model. Our experiments on real world e-mail datasets demonstrate that our system can effectively block advanced email attacks sent from genuine email accounts, which traditional protection systems are unable to detect. Moreover, we show that it is resilient to an attacker willing to evade the system. To the best of our knowledge, IdentityMailer is the first system able to identify spearphishing emails that are sent from within an organization, by a skilled attacker having access to a compromised email account.",14,[],7

Effective algorithms for all parts of the pipeline, from document retrieval to relation prediction and response post-processing, are bundled in a modular end-to-end relation extraction system called RelationFactory. The main run solely focuses on shallow techniques and achieved significant improvements over LSV's last year's system, while using the same training data and patterns. Improvements mainly have been obtained by a feature representation focusing on surface skip n-grams and improved scoring for extracted distant supervision patterns. Important factors for effective extraction are the training and tuning scheme for distant supervision classifiers, and the query expansion by a translation model based on Wikipedia links.

1402.0452,cs,"Recently, we have proposed a maximum likelihood iterative algorithm for estimation of the parameters of the Nakagami-m distribution. This technique performs better than state of art estimation techniques for this distribution. This could be of particular use in low data or block based estimation problems. In these scenarios, the estimator should be able to give accurate estimates in the mean square sense with less amounts of data. Also, the estimates should improve with the increase in number of blocks received. In this paper, we see through our simulations, that our proposal is well designed for such requirements. Further, it is well known in the literature that an efficient estimator does not exist for Nakagami-m distribution. In this paper, we derive a theoretical expression for the variance of our proposed estimator. We find that this expression clearly fits the experimental curve for the variance of the proposed estimator. This expression is pretty close to the cramer-rao lower bound(CRLB).",14,[],7
1405.4487,cs,"Providing femto-access points (FAPs) with computational capabilities will allow (either total or partial) offloading of highly demanding applications from smart-phones to the so called femto-cloud. Such offloading promises to be beneficial in terms of battery saving at the mobile terminal (MT) and/or latency reduction in the execution of applications, whenever the energy and/or time required for the communication process are compensated by the energy and/or time savings that result from the remote computation at the FAPs. For this problem, we provide in this paper a framework for the joint optimization of the radio and computational resource usage exploiting the tradeoff between energy consumption and latency, and assuming that multiple antennas are available at the MT and the serving FAP. As a result of the optimization, the optimal communication strategy (e.g., transmission power, rate, precoder) is obtained, as well as the optimal distribution of the computational load between the handset and the serving FAP.

1403.0879,cs,"Bipedal locomotion is a phenomenon that still eludes a fundamental and concise mathematical understanding. Conceptual models that capture some relevant aspects of the process exist but their full explanatory power is not yet exhausted. In the current study, we introduce the robustness criterion which defines the conditions for stable locomotion when steps are taken with imprecise angle of attack. Intuitively, the necessity of a higher precision indicates the difficulty to continue moving with a given gait. We show that the spring-loaded inverted pendulum model, under the robustness criterion, is consistent with previously reported findings on attentional demand during human locomotion. This criterion allows transitions between running and walking, many of which conserve forward speed. Simulations of transitions predict Froude numbers below the ones observed in humans, nevertheless the model satisfactorily reproduces several biomechanical indicators such as hip excursion, gait duty factor and vertical ground reaction force profiles. Furthermore, we identify reversible robust walk-run transitions, which allow the system to execute a robust version of the hopping gait. These findings foster the spring-loaded inverted pendulum model as the unifying framework for the understanding of bipedal locomotion.",14,[],7
1403.0282,cs,Trust is an absolute necessity for digital communications; but is often viewed as an implicit singular entity. The use of the internet as the primary vehicle for information exchange has made accountability and verifiability of system code almost obsolete. This paper proposes a novel approach towards enforcing system security by requiring the explicit definition of trust for all operating code. By identifying the various classes and levels of trust required within a computing system; trust is defined as a combination of individual characteristics. Trust is then represented as a calculable metric obtained through the collective enforcement of each of these characteristics to varying degrees. System Security is achieved by facilitating trust to be a constantly evolving aspect for each operating code segment capable of getting stronger or weaker over time.,14,[],7

1401.3454,cs,"Several multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms have been proposed to optimize agents decisions. Due to the complexity of the problem, the majority of the previously developed MARL algorithms assumed agents either had some knowledge of the underlying game (such as Nash equilibria) and/or observed other agents actions and the rewards they received.   We introduce a new MARL algorithm called the Weighted Policy Learner (WPL), which allows agents to reach a Nash Equilibrium (NE) in benchmark 2-player-2-action games with minimum knowledge. Using WPL, the only feedback an agent needs is its own local reward (the agent does not observe other agents actions or rewards). Furthermore, WPL does not assume that agents know the underlying game or the corresponding Nash Equilibrium a priori. We experimentally show that our algorithm converges in benchmark two-player-two-action games. We also show that our algorithm converges in the challenging Shapleys game where previous MARL algorithms failed to converge without knowing the underlying game or the NE. Furthermore, we show that WPL outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in a more realistic setting of 100 agents interacting and learning concurrently.   An important aspect of understanding the behavior of a MARL algorithm is analyzing the dynamics of the algorithm: how the policies of multiple learning agents evolve over time as agents interact with one another. Such an analysis not only verifies whether agents using a given MARL algorithm will eventually converge, but also reveals the behavior of the MARL algorithm prior to convergence. We analyze our algorithm in two-player-two-action games and show that symbolically proving WPLs convergence is difficult, because of the non-linear nature of WPLs dynamics, unlike previous MARL algorithms that had either linear or piece-wise-linear dynamics. Instead, we numerically solve WPLs dynamics differential equations and compare the solution to the dynamics of previous MARL algorithms.",14,[],7

Within this ranking step we integrate the information of tag usage and time using the Base-Level Learning (BLL) equation coming from human memory theory that is used to determine the reuse-probability of words and tags using a power-law forgetting function.   As the results of our extensive evaluation conducted on data-sets gathered from three social tagging systems (BibSonomy, CiteULike and MovieLens) show, the usage of tag-based and time information via the BLL equation also helps to improve the ranking and recommendation process of items and thus, can be used to realize an effective item recommender that outperforms two alternative algorithms which also exploit time and tag-based information.",14,[],7

1401.6338,cs,"A task is randomly drawn from a finite set of tasks and is described using a fixed number of bits. All the tasks that share its description must be performed. Upper and lower bounds on the minimum equation-th moment of the number of performed tasks are derived. The case where a sequence of tasks is produced by a source and equation tasks are jointly described using equation bits is considered. If equation is larger than the R\'enyi entropy rate of the source of order equation (provided it exists), then the equation-th moment of the ratio of performed tasks to equation can be driven to one as equation tends to infinity. If equation is smaller than the R\'enyi entropy rate, this moment tends to infinity. The results are generalized to account for the presence of side-information. In this more general setting, the key quantity is a conditional version of R\'enyi entropy that was introduced by Arimoto.

We extend the idea of multi-hop routing and relay the message by multiple nodes attaining joint beamforming gain with higher reception range. In each round, the message is repeated by relay nodes at dedicated positions after a fixed waiting period. Such simple algorithms can send a message from any node to any other node in time equation and with asymptotical energy equation, the same energy an optimal multi-hop routing strategy needs using short hops between source and target. Here, equation denotes the wavelength of the carrier. For equation we prove a tight lower time bound of equation. Then, we consider equation randomly distributed nodes in a square of area equation and we show for a transmission range of equation and for a wavelength of equation that the unicast problem can be solved in equation rounds as well. The corresponding transmission energy increases to equation. Finally, we present simulation results visualizing the nature of our algorithms.",14,[],7
1411.2057,cs,"A common phenomena in modern recommendation systems is the use of feedback from one user to infer the `value' of an item to other users. This results in an exploration vs. exploitation trade-off, in which items of possibly low value have to be presented to users in order to ascertain their value. Existing approaches to solving this problem focus on the case where the number of items are small, or admit some underlying structure -- it is unclear, however, if good recommendation is possible when dealing with content-rich settings with unstructured content.   We consider this problem under a simple natural model, wherein the number of items and the number of item-views are of the same order, and an `access-graph' constrains which user is allowed to see which item. Our main insight is that the presence of the access-graph in fact makes good recommendation possible -- however this requires the exploration policy to be designed to take advantage of the access-graph. Our results demonstrate the importance of `serendipity' in exploration, and how higher graph-expansion translates to a higher quality of recommendations; it also suggests a reason why in some settings, simple policies like Twitter's `Latest-First' policy achieve a good performance.   From a technical perspective, our model presents a way to study exploration-exploitation tradeoffs in settings where the number of `trials' and `strategies' are large (potentially infinite), and more importantly, of the same order. Our algorithms admit competitive-ratio guarantees which hold for the worst-case user, under both finite-population and infinite-horizon settings, and are parametrized in terms of properties of the underlying graph. Conversely, we also demonstrate that improperly-designed policies can be highly sub-optimal, and that in many settings, our results are order-wise optimal.",14,[],7

Through the analysis of the SAT problem using the elements, I prove that we can construct a k-SAT (k>2) instance where the coefficients of cutting planes take exponentially large values in the input size. This exponential property is caused by the number system formed from the calculation of coefficients. In addition, I show that 2-SAT does not form the number system and Horn-SAT partially forms the number system according to the feasible value of the dominant variable. Whether or not the coefficients of cutting planes in cutting plane proof are polynomially bounded was open problem. Many researchers believed that cutting plane proofs with large coefficients are highly non-intuitive20. However, we can construct a k-SAT (k>2) instance in which cutting planes take exponentially large coefficients by the number system. In addition, this exponential property is so strong that it gives definite answers for several questions: why Horn-SAT has the intermediate property between 2-SAT and 3-SAT; why random-SAT is so easy; and why k-SAT (k>2) cannot be solved with the linear programming technique.

With deployment of helper level between server and peers, optimizing the user/helper topology becomes a challenging task since applying well-known reciprocity-based choking algorithms is impossible due to the one-directional nature of video streaming from helpers to users. Because of selfish behavior of peers and lack of central authority among them, selection of helpers requires coordination. In this paper, we design a distributed online helper selection mechanism which is adaptable to supply and demand pattern of various video channels. Our solution for strategic peers' exploitation from the shared resources of helpers is to guarantee the convergence to correlated equilibria (CE) among the helper selection strategies. Online convergence to the set of CE is achieved through the regret-tracking algorithm which tracks the equilibrium in the presence of stochastic dynamics of helpers' bandwidth.

1410.0431,cs,"This two-part paper presents a feedback-based cross-layer framework for distributed sensing and estimation of a dynamic process by a wireless sensor network (WSN). Sensor nodes wirelessly communicate measurements to the fusion center (FC). Cross-layer factors such as packet collisions and the sensing-transmission costs are considered. Each SN adapts its sensing-transmission action based on its own local observation quality and the estimation quality feedback from the FC under cost constraints for each SN. In this first part, the optimization complexity is reduced by exploiting the statistical symmetry and large network approximation of the WSN. Structural properties of the optimal policy are derived for a coordinated and a decentralized scheme. It is proved that a dense WSN provides sensing diversity, so that only a few SNs with the best local observation quality need to be activated, despite the fluctuations of the WSN. The optimal policy dictates that, when the estimation quality is poor, only the best SNs activate, otherwise all SNs remain idle to preserve energy. The costs of coordination and feedback are evaluated, revealing the scalability of the decentralized scheme to large WSNs, at the cost of performance degradation. Simulation results demonstrate cost savings from 30% to 70% over a non-adaptive scheme, and significant gains over a previously proposed estimator which does not consider these cross-layer factors.",14,[],7

The novel estimators (controllers) compute local estimates (control actions) simply as linear combinations of inputs and outputs (states) of local subsystems. The size of these local data sets essentially depends on the condition number of the finite-time observability (controllability) Gramian. Furthermore, the developed theory shows that the sparsity patterns of the system matrices of the distributed estimators (controllers) are primarily determined by the sparsity patterns of state-space matrices of large-scale systems. The computational and memory complexity of the approximation algorithms are equation, where equation is the number of local subsystems of the interconnected system. Consequently, the proposed approximation methodology is computationally feasible for interconnected systems with an extremely large number of local subsystems.",14,['math'],7

1409.0494,cs,"Transmission of a Gaussian source over a time-varying multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel is studied under strict delay constraints. Availability of a correlated side information at the receiver is assumed, whose quality, i.e., correlation with the source signal, also varies over time. A block-fading model is considered for the states of the time-varying channel and the time-varying side information; and perfect state information at the receiver is assumed, while the transmitter knows only the statistics. The high SNR performance, characterized by the \textitdistortion exponent, is studied for this joint source-channel coding problem. An upper bound is derived and compared with lowers based on list decoding, hybrid digital-analog transmission, as well as multi-layer schemes which transmit successive refinements of the source, relying on progressive and superposed transmission with list decoding. The optimal distortion exponent is characterized for the single-input multiple-output (SIMO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO) scenarios by showing that the distortion exponent achieved by multi-layer superpositon encoding with joint decoding meets the proposed upper bound.

1405.5329,cs,"The amount of information lost in sub-Nyquist sampling of a continuous-time Gaussian stationary process is quantified. We consider a combined source coding and sub-Nyquist reconstruction problem in which the input to the encoder is a noisy sub-Nyquist sampled version of the analog source. We first derive an expression for the mean squared error in the reconstruction of the process from a noisy and information rate-limited version of its samples. This expression is a function of the sampling frequency and the average number of bits describing each sample. It is given as the sum of two terms: Minimum mean square error in estimating the source from its noisy but otherwise fully observed sub-Nyquist samples, and a second term obtained by reverse waterfilling over an average of spectral densities associated with the polyphase components of the source. We extend this result to multi-branch uniform sampling, where the samples are available through a set of parallel channels with a uniform sampler and a pre-sampling filter in each branch. Further optimization to reduce distortion is then performed over the pre-sampling filters, and an optimal set of pre-sampling filters associated with the statistics of the input signal and the sampling frequency is found. This results in an expression for the minimal possible distortion achievable under any analog to digital conversion scheme involving uniform sampling and linear filtering. These results thus unify the Shannon-Whittaker-Kotelnikov sampling theorem and Shannon rate-distortion theory for Gaussian sources.",14,['math'],7
1404.6218,cs,"Processors with large numbers of cores are becoming commonplace. In order to take advantage of the available resources in these systems, the programming paradigm has to move towards increased parallelism. However, increasing the level of concurrency in the program does not necessarily lead to better performance. Parallel programming models have to provide flexible ways of defining parallel tasks and at the same time, efficiently managing the created tasks. OpenMP is a widely accepted programming model for shared-memory architectures. In this paper we highlight some of the drawbacks in the OpenMP tasking approach, and propose an alternative model based on the Glasgow Parallel Reduction Machine (GPRM) programming framework. As the main focus of this study, we deploy our model to solve a fundamental linear algebra problem, LU factorisation of sparse matrices. We have used the SparseLU benchmark from the BOTS benchmark suite, and compared the results obtained from our model to those of the OpenMP tasking approach. The TILEPro64 system has been used to run the experiments.

In the recently proposed context of per-antenna power constrained multigroup multicasting, the present work focuses on a novel system design that aims at maximizing the total achievable throughput. Towards increasing the system sum rate, the available power resources need to be allocated to well conditioned groups of users. A detailed solution to tackle the elaborate sum rate maximization multigroup multicast problem under per-antenna power constraints is therefore derived. Numerical results are presented to quantify the gains of the proposed algorithm over heuristic solutions. Besides Rayleigh faded channels, the solution is also applied to uniform linear array transmitters operating in the far field, where line-ofsight conditions are realized.

1405.3558,cs,"The aim of this review paper is to give a panoramic of the impact of spin glass theory and statistical physics in the study of the K-sat problem. The introduction of spin glass theory in the study of the random K-sat problem has indeed left a mark on the field, leading to some groundbreaking descriptions of the geometry of its solution space, and helping to shed light on why it seems to be so hard to solve.   Most of the geometrical intuitions have their roots in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of spin glass. We'll start Chapter 2 by introducing the model from a mathematical perspective, presenting a selection of rigorous results and giving a first intuition about the cavity method. We'll then switch to a physical perspective, to explore concepts like pure states, hierarchical clustering and replica symmetry breaking.   Chapter 3 will be devoted to the spin glass formulation of K-sat, while the most important phase transitions of K-sat (clustering, condensation, freezing and SAT/UNSAT) will be extensively discussed in Chapter 4, with respect their complexity, free-entropy density and the Parisi 1RSB parameter.   The concept of algorithmic barrier will be presented in Chapter 5 and exemplified in detail on the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm. The BP algorithm will be introduced and motivated, and numerical analysis of a BP-guided decimation algorithm will be used to show the role of the clustering, condensation and freezing phase transitions in creating an algorithmic barrier for BP.

Moreover, when equation is only assumed to be nowhere dense, then we give an almost linear kernel on equation for the classic Dominating Set problem, i.e., for the case equation. These results generalize a line of previous research on finding linear kernels for Dominating Set and equation-Dominating Set. However, the approach taken in this work, which is based on the theory of sparse graphs, is radically different and conceptually much simpler than the previous approaches.   We complement our findings by showing that for the closely related Connected Dominating Set problem, the existence of such kernelization algorithms is unlikely, even though the problem is known to admit a linear kernel on equation-topological-minor-free graphs. Also, we prove that for any somewhere dense class equation, there is some equation for which equation-Dominating Set is W[equation]-hard on equation.

In this way a very promising performance is achieved due to the balance of large-scale exploration and local search. The resulting algorithm shows evidence for self-organised criticality, brought about via the intrinsic dynamics of the swarm as it interacts with the objective function, rather than being explicitly specified.

1405.3629,cs,"One of the basic tenets in information theory, the data processing inequality states that output divergence does not exceed the input divergence for any channel. For channels without input constraints, various estimates on the amount of such contraction are known, Dobrushin's coefficient for the total variation being perhaps the most well-known. This work investigates channels with average input cost constraint. It is found that while the contraction coefficient typically equals one (no contraction), the information nevertheless dissipates. A certain non-linear function, the \emphDobrushin curve of the channel, is proposed to quantify the amount of dissipation. Tools for evaluating the Dobrushin curve of additive-noise channels are developed based on coupling arguments. Some basic applications in stochastic control, uniqueness of Gibbs measures and fundamental limits of noisy circuits are discussed.   As an application, it shown that in the chain of equation power-constrained relays and Gaussian channels the end-to-end mutual information and maximal squared correlation decay as equation, which is in stark contrast with the exponential decay in chains of discrete channels. Similarly, the behavior of noisy circuits (composed of gates with bounded fan-in) and broadcasting of information on trees (of bounded degree) does not experience threshold behavior in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Namely, unlike the case of discrete channels, the probability of bit error stays bounded away from equation regardless of the SNR.",14,['math'],7

In this paper, we consider the multi-cell D2D underlaid cellular network in which many D2D links reuse the uplink resource simultaneously. The infeasibility of interference cancellation/alignment motivates us to force the D2D users near the base stations to work in cellular mode. Based on that, we present a distributed and scalable mode selection scheme based on guard zone to make a good tradeoff between decreasing interference penalty to base stations and improving spectrum utilization. With the help of stochastic geometry, we develop an analytically tractable framework to analyze the interference and then throughput for the two kinds of users in the considered scenario. The results obtained by the framework reveal that enabling D2D communication does improve the per user throughput and that a proper guard zone can further significantly increase the average throughput of both kinds of users. Thanks to the tractability of our model, the optimal guard zone, which is the key parameter in our scheme, can be efficiently obtained by finding the root of the first order derivative of the throughput expression.

If trajectories in the sense of de~Broglie-Bohm are introduced in the quantum theory, these are found to match those of the classical theory.

1412.8636,gr-qc,"This is the second lecture of `RAGtime' series on electrodynamical effects near black holes. We will summarize the basic equations of relativistic electrodynamics in terms of spin-coefficient (Newman-Penrose) formalism. The aim of the lecture is to present important relations that hold for exact electro-vacuum solutions and to exhibit, in a pedagogical manner, some illustrative solutions and useful approximation approaches. First, we concentrate on weak electromagnetic fields and we illustrate their structure by constructing the magnetic and electric lines of force. Gravitational field of the black hole assumes axial symmetry, whereas the electromagnetic field may or may not share the same symmetry. With these solutions we can investigate the frame-dragging effects acting on electromagnetic fields near a rotating black hole. These fields develop magnetic null points and current sheets. Their structure suggests that magnetic reconnection takes place near the rotating black hole horizon. Finally, the last section will be devoted to the transition from test-field solution to exact solutions of coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations. New effects emerge within the framework of exact solutions: the expulsion of the magnetic flux out of the black-hole horizon depends on the intensity of the imposed magnetic field.",14,['astro-ph'],13

1404.6444,gr-qc,"The paper deals with the mechanism of particle creation in the framework of irreversible thermodynamics. The second order non-equilibrium thermodynamical prescription of Israel and Stewart has been presented with particle creation rate, treated as the dissipative effect. In the background of a flat FRW model, we assume the non-equilibrium thermodynamical process to be isentropic so that the entropy per particle does not change and consequently the dissipative pressure can be expressed linearly in terms of the particle creation rate. Here the dissipative pressure behaves as a dynamical variable having a non-linear inhomogeneous evolution equation and the entropy flow vector satisfies the second law of thermodynamics. Further, using the Friedmann equations and by proper choice of the particle creation rate as a function of the Hubble parameter, it is possible to show (separately) a transition from the inflationary phase to the radiation era and also from matter dominated era to late time acceleration. Also, in analogy to analytic continuation, it is possible to show a continuous cosmic evolution from inflation to late time acceleration by adjusting the parameters. It is found that in the de Sitter phase, the comoving entropy increases exponentially with time, keeping entropy per particle unchanged. Subsequently, the above cosmological scenarios has been described from field theoretic point of view by introducing a scalar field having self interacting potential. Finally, we make an attempt to show the cosmological phenomenon of particle creation as Hawking radiation, particularly during the inflationary era.",14,[],13

1410.6509,gr-qc,"Absolute space is eliminated from the body of mechanics by gauging translations and rotations in the Lagrangian of a classical system. The procedure implies the addition of compensating terms to the kinetic energy, in such a way that the resulting equations of motion are valid in any frame. The compensating terms provide inertial forces depending on the total momentum P, intrinsic angular momentum J and intrinsic inertia tensor I. Therefore, the privileged frames where Newton's equations are valid (Newtonian frames) are completely determined by the matter distribution of the universe (Machianization). At the Hamiltonian level, the gauge invariance leads to first class constraints that remove those degrees of freedom that make no sense once the absolute space has been eliminated. This reformulation of classical mechanics is entirely relational, since it is a dynamics for the distances between particles. It is also Machian, since the rotation of the rest of the universe produces centrifugal effects. It then provides a new perspective to consider the foundational ideas of general relativity, like Mach's principle and the weak equivalence principle. With regard to the concept of time, the absence of an absolute time is known to be a characteristic of parametrized systems. Furthermore, the scale invariance of those parametrized systems whose potentials are inversely proportional to the squared distances can be also gauged by introducing another compensating term associated with the intrinsic virial G (shape-dynamics).",14,"['astro-ph', 'hep-th', 'physics']",13

To this purpose, we take the matter content of the stellar object as a homogeneous Weyssenhoff fluid which is a generalization of perfect fluid in general relativity (GR) to include the spin of matter. Employing the homogeneous and isotropic FLRW metric for the interior spacetime setup, it is shown that the spin of matter, in the context of a negative pressure, acts against the pull of gravity and decelerates the dynamical evolution of the collapse in its later stages. Our results bode a picture of gravitational collapse in which the collapse process halts at a finite radius whose value depends on the initial configuration. We thus show that the spacetime singularity that occurs in the OS model is replaced by a non-singular bounce beyond which the collapsing cloud re-expands to infinity. Depending on the model parameters, one can find a minimum value for the boundary of the collapsing cloud or correspondingly a threshold value for the mass content below which the horizon formation can be avoided.

In order to study the propagation of wave fronts, we integrate the equations of bicharacteristics which are null geodesics, and we are able to express them, for the first time in the literature, with the help of elliptic integrals for another choice of Kasner parameters. For generic values of the three Kasner parameters, the solution of the Cauchy problem is built through a pair of integral operators, where the amplitude and phase functions in the integrand solve a coupled system of partial differential equations. The first is the so-called transport equation, whereas the second is a nonlinear equation that reduces to the eikonal equation if the amplitude is a slowly varying function. Remarkably, the analysis of such a coupled system is proved to be equivalent to building first an auxiliary covariant vector having vanishing divergence, while all nonlinearities are mapped into solving a covariant generalization of the Ermakov-Pinney equation for the amplitude function. Last, from a linear set of equations for the gradient of the phase one recovers the phase itself.

The naked singularity case presents a very structured non-connected set of regions of orbital stability, where the presence of counterrotating particles and zero angular momentum particles for a specific class of naked singularities is interpreted as due to the presence of a repulsive field generated by the central source of gravity. In particular, we analyze the effects of the dynamical structure of the ergoregion (the union of the orbital regions for different attractor spins) on the behavior of accretion disks around the central source.

It is shown that mass depends on velocity as in Special Relativity, and that the velocity is constant for a particular characteristic value. In the limit of vanishing friction the theory satisfies a relativity principle as bodies do not decelerate and, therefore, the absolute frame becomes unobservable. However, the limit theory is not Newtonian mechanics, with its Galilei group symmetry, but rather Special Relativity. This result suggests to regard Special Relativity as the limit of a theory presenting universal friction and exchange of mass-energy with a reservoir (vacuum). Thus, quite surprisingly, Special Relativity follows from the absolute space (ether) concept and could have been discovered following studies of Aristotelian mechanics and friction. We end the work confronting the full theory with observations.

Group averaging over these rotations yields our first proposal for spherical symmetry. Hamiltonians of the full theory with angle-independent lapse preserve this spherically symmetric subsector of the full Hilbert space. A second proposal consists in implementing the vanishing of a certain vector field in spherical symmetry as a constraint on the full Hilbert space, leading to a close analogue of diffeomorphisms invariant states. While this second set of spherically symmetric states does not allow for using the full Hamiltonian, it is naturally suited to implement the spherically symmetric midisuperspace Hamiltonian, as an operator in the full theory, on it. Due to the canonical structure of the reduced variables, the holonomy-flux algebra behaves effectively as a one parameter family of 21-dimensional algebras along the radial coordinate, leading to a diagonal non-vanishing volume operator on 3-valent vertices.

In particular, we describe the scalar field solutions in Friedmann-Lema\itre-Robertson-Walker cosmology in Einstein and Jordan frames, and explain their correspondence despite the approximate equations turning out to be linear and non-linear in different frames.",14,[],13

1407.1265,gr-qc,"The varying speed of light (VSL) theory is controversial. It succeeds in explaining some cosmological problems, but on the other hand it is excluded by mainstream physics because it will shake the foundation of physics. In the present paper, we devote ourselves to test whether the speed of light is varying from the observational data of the type Ia Supernova, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation, Observational equation data and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We select the common form equation with the contribution of dark energy and matter, where equation is the current value of speed of light, equation is a constant, and consequently construct a varying speed of light dark energy model (VSLDE). The combined observational data show a much trivial constraint equation at 68.3\% confidence level, which indicates that the speed of light may be a constant with high significance. By reconstructing the time-variable equation, we find that the speed of light almost has no variation for redshift equation. For high-equation observations, they are more sensitive to the VSLDE model, but the variation of speed of light is only in order of equation. We also introduce the geometrical diagnostic equation to show the difference between the VSLDE and equationCDM model. The result shows that the current data are difficult to differentiate them. All the results show that the observational data favor the constant speed of light.",14,[],13

1412.8450,gr-qc,"We present a general model of interacting metric fields with the sum of massless non-interacting spin 2 fields as the linear limit. In the non-interacting limit the model is reduced to a sum of general relativity actions, with the usual Einstein-Hilbert kinetic term for each metric field. Until now the accepted view was that such theories are inconsistent since it has been proven that ghost terms and/or discontinuity in the number of degrees of freedom at the zero interaction limit, are unavoidable. We do not refute these results, but instead prove by construction that they do not necessarily lead to inconsistencies. In particular, our suggested theories are: 1. Energetically stable, i.e. their Hamiltonian is bounded from below and the multi-Minkowski metric configuration is the unique ground state. 2. Continuous in the zero interaction limit so that general relativity solutions are restored smoothly. 3. Include no higher than two derivative Lagrangian terms. In addition, the dominant energy condition is maintained with respect to all metric fields for all field configurations.",14,[],13

The kinetic corrections due to space-time curvature are shown to lift the familiar (n,j) degeneracy of the energy levels of the hydrogen atom. We supplement the discussion by a consideration of an attractive scalar potential, which, in the fully relativistic Dirac formalism, modifies the mass of the particle according to the replacement m -> m (1 - letter/r), where r is the radial coordinate. We conclude with a few comments regarding the (n,j) degeneracy of the energy levels, where n is the principal quantum number, and j is the total angular momentum, and illustrate the calculations by way of a numerical example.",14,"['hep-ph', 'hep-th', 'quant-ph']",13

As illustrative examples of the method efficiency, we see how to compute the renormalized energy density and pressure in two interesting cosmological scenarios: a de Sitter spacetime and a radiation-dominated universe.

1406.5677,gr-qc,"The iron Kequation line commonly observed in the X-ray spectrum of both stellar-mass and supermassive black hole candidates is produced by the illumination of a cold accretion disk by a hot corona. In this framework, the activation of a new flaring region in the hot corona imprints a time variation on the iron line spectrum. Future X-ray facilities with high time resolution and large effective areas may be able to measure the so-called 2-dimensional transfer function; that is, the iron line profile detected by a distant observer as a function of time in response to an instantaneous flare from the X-ray primary source. This work is a preliminary study to determine if and how such a technique can provide more information about the spacetime geometry around the compact object than the already possible measurements of the time-integrated iron line profile. Within our simplified model, we find that a measurement of iron line reverberation can improve constraints appreciably given a sufficiently strong signal, though that most of the information is present in the time-integrated spectrum. Our aim is to test the Kerr metric. We find that current X-ray facilities and data are unable to provide strong tests of the Kerr nature of supermassive black hole candidates.

This new code carefully maintains high precision to allow us to obtain high-accuracy solutions for the gravitational quasinormal modes of the Kerr space-time. Part of this new code is an implementation of a spectral method for solving the angular Teukolsky equation that, to our knowledge, has not been used before for determining quasinormal modes. We focus our attention on two main areas. First, we explore the behavior of these quasinormal modes in the extreme limit of Kerr, where the frequency of certain modes approaches accumulation points on the real axis. We compare our results with recent analytic predictions of the behavior of these modes near the accumulation points and find good agreement. Second, we explore the behavior of solutions of modes that approach the special frequency equation in the Schwarzschild limit. Our high-accuracy methods allow us to more closely approach the Schwarzschild limit than was possible with previous numerical studies. Unlike previous work, we find excellent agreement with analytic predictions of the behavior near this special frequency. We include a detailed description of our methods, and make use of the theory of confluent Heun differential equations throughout.

If we focus on the the weakly self-gravitating and slowly evolving system whose spatial extent is much smaller than the scale of the cosmological horizon in the homogeneous and isotropic background universe model, the cosmological Newtonian approximation is available. Also in the huge void universe model, the same kind of approximation as the cosmological Newtonian approximation is available for the analysis of the perturbations contained in a region whose spatial size is much smaller than the scale of the huge void: the effects of the huge void are taken into account in a perturbative manner by using the Fermi-normal coordinates. By using this approximation, we derive the equations of motion for the weakly self-gravitating perturbations whose elements have relative velocities much smaller than the speed of light, and show the derived equations can be significantly different from those in the homogeneous and isotropic universe model, due to the anisotropic volume expansion in the huge void.

The standard model fields interact via the bulk Weyl tensor and cause brane fluctuations. Due to the warp factor, disturbances don't fade away during the expansion of the universe. The late-time behavior could be significant deviate from the standard evolution of the universe. The effect is triggered by the time-dependent part of the warp factor.

1408.5976,gr-qc,"In this paper, we first show that the definition of the universal horizons studied recently in the khrononmetric theory of gravity can be straightforwardly generalized to other theories that violate the Lorentz symmetry, by simply considering the khronon as a probe field and playing the same role as a Killing vector field. As an application, we study static charged (equation)-dimensional spacetimes in the framework of the healthy (non-projectable) Horava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity in the infrared limit, and find various solutions. Some of them represent Lifshitz space-times with hyperscaling violations, and some have black hole structures. In the latter universal horizons always exist inside the Killing horizons. The surface gravity on them can be either larger or smaller than the surface gravity on the Killing horizons, depending on the space-times considered. Although such black holes are found only in the infrared, we argue that black holes with universal horizons also exist in the full theory of the HL gravity.

1412.0743,gr-qc,"We provide a simple analytical solution of the Friedmann equations for a universe made of stiff matter, dust matter, and dark energy. A stiff matter era is present in the cosmological model of Zel'dovich (1972) where the primordial universe is assumed to be made of a cold gas of baryons. It also occurs in certain cosmological models where dark matter is made of relativistic self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). When the energy density of the stiff matter is positive, the primordial universe is singular. It starts from a state with a vanishing scale factor and an infinite density. We consider the possibility that the energy density of the stiff matter is negative (anti-stiff matter). This happens, for example, when the BECs have an attractive self-interaction. In that case, the primordial universe is non-singular. It starts from a state in which the scale factor is finite and the energy density is equal to zero. For the sake of generality, we consider a cosmological constant of arbitrary sign. When the cosmological constant is positive, the universe asymptotically reaches a de Sitter phase where the scale factor increases exponentially rapidly. This can account for the accelerating expansion of the universe that we observe at present. When the cosmological constant is negative (anti-de Sitter), the evolution of the universe is cyclic. Therefore, depending on the sign of the energy density of the stiff matter and of the dark energy, we obtain singular and non-singular expanding or cyclic universes.",14,[],13

Even more than for anti-deuterons, the DM-produced anti-He flux can be mostly prominent over the astrophysical anti-He background at low kinetic energies, typically below 3-5 GeV/n. However, the larger number of anti-nucleons involved in the formation process makes the anti-He flux extremely small. We therefore explore, for a few DM benchmark cases, whether the yield is sufficient to allow for anti-He detection in current-generation experiments, such as AMS-02. We account for the uncertainties due to the propagation in the Galaxy and to the uncertain details of the coalescence process, and we consider the constraints already imposed by anti-proton searches.

1401.4347,hep-ph,"Type-II seesaw is a simple scenario in which Majorana neutrino masses are generated by the exchange of a heavy scalar electroweak triplet. When endowed with additional heavy fields, such as right-handed neutrinos or extra triplets, it also provides a compelling framework for baryogenesis via leptogenesis. We derive in this context the full network of Boltzmann equations for studying leptogenesis in the flavored regime. To this end we determine the relations which hold among the chemical potentials of the various particle species in the thermal bath. This takes into account the SM Yukawa interactions of both leptons and quarks as well as sphaleron processes which, depending on the temperature, may be classified as faster or slower than the Hubble rate. We find that when leptogenesis is enabled by the presence of an extra triplet, lepton flavor effects allow the production of the equation asymmetry through lepton number conserving CP asymmetries. This scenario becomes dominant as soon as the triplets couple more to leptons than to SM scalar doublets. In this case, the way the equation asymmetry is created through flavor effects is novel: instead of invoking the effect of equation-violating inverse decays faster than the Hubble rate, it involves the effect of equation-violating inverse decays slower than the Hubble rate. We also analyze the more general situation where lepton number violating CP asymmetries are present and actively participate in the generation of the equation asymmetry, pointing out that as long as equation-violating triplet decays are still in thermal equilibrium when the triplet gauge scattering processes decouple, flavor effects can be striking, allowing to avoid all washout suppression effects from seesaw interactions. In this case the amount of equation asymmetry produced is limited only by a universal gauge suppression effect, which nevertheless goes away for large triplet decay rates.",14,[],2

We find this empirical method to well reproduce the results from current experiments, and present arguments as to why this is the case.

This implies that global cosmic strings generally form after the end of inflation in most supersymmetric models, including the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. The cosmic strings emit gravitational waves whose frequency corresponds to the Hubble scale, until they disappear when the Hubble parameter decreases down to the soft mass of the flat direction.

1411.4959,hep-ph,"The properties and consequences of complex saddle points are explored in phenomenological models of QCD at non-zero temperature and density. Such saddle points are a consequence of the sign problem, and should be considered in both theoretical calculations and lattice simulations. Although saddle points in finite-density QCD are typically in the complex plane, they are constrained by a symmetry that simplifies analysis. We model the effective potential for Polyakov loops using two different potential terms for confinement effects, and consider three different cases for quarks: very heavy quarks, massless quarks without modeling of chiral symmetry breaking effects, and light quarks with both deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration effects included in a pair of PNJL models. In all cases, we find that a single dominant complex saddle point is required for a consistent description of the model. This saddle point is generally not far from the real axis; the most easily noticed effect is a difference between the Polyakov loop expectation values equation and equation, and that is confined to small region in the equation plane. In all but one case, a disorder line is found in the region of critical and/or crossover behavior. The disorder line marks the boundary between exponential decay and sinusoidally modulated exponential decay of correlation functions. Disorder line effects are potentially observable in both simulation and experiment. Precision simulations of QCD in the equation plane have the potential to clearly discriminate between different models of confinement.",14,"['hep-lat', 'nucl-th']",2

In this article, a two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) in which such defects do not exist at all is to be demonstrated. The general pattern of matrix pairs which can be diagonalized simultaneously by a same unitary transformation is proposed without extra constraints like symmetries or zeros in M matrices. Only an assumption of the hermiticity of mass matrices is employed in the derivation. With this assumption, number of parameters in the mass matrix of a specific fermion type is reduced from eighteen down to five. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are analytically derived and it's surprising that unitary transformation matrix thus derived depends on only two parameters.

We test the consistency of each model by demanding a simultaneous account of the azimuthal, the transverse momentum, and the centrality dependence of the data at both 0.2 and 2.76 ATeV energies.

We test the sensitivity of predictions to different skewed energy-loss fluctuations via a convenient scaling factor distributed in a finite range equation with unit mean. While a previously proposed AdS/CFT jet-energy loss model with a temperature-independent jet-medium coupling as well as a near-equation dominated, pQCD-inspired energy-loss scenario are shown to be inconsistent with the LHC data, once the parameters are constrained by fitting to RHIC results, we find several new solutions with a temperature-dependent jet-medium coupling.

1412.8719,hep-th,"In this paper, we present a detailed study of Skyrmion-Skyrmion scattering for two equation Skyrmions in the attractive channel where we observe two different scattering regimes. For large separation, the scattering can be approximated as interacting dipoles. We give a qualitative estimate when this approximation breaks down. For small separations we observe an additional short-range repulsion which is qualitatively similar to monopole scattering. We also observe the interesting effect of ""rotation without rotating"" whereby two Skyrmions, whose orientations remain constant while well-separated, change their orientation after scattering. We can explain this effect by following preimages through the scattering process, thereby measuring which part of an in-coming Skyrmion forms part of an out-going Skyrmion. This leads to a new way of visualising Skyrmions. Furthermore, we consider spinning Skyrmions and find interesting trajectories.",14,[],4
1412.2628,hep-th,We semiclassically investigate Schwinger pair production for pulsed rotating electric fields depending on time. To do so we solve the Dirac equation for two-component fields in a WKB-like approximation. The result shows that for two-component fields the spin distribution of produced pairs is generally not equation. As a result the pair creation rates of spinor and scalar quantum electro dynamics (QED) are different even for one pair of turning points. For rotating electric fields the pair creation rate is dominated by particles with a specific spin depending on the sense of rotation for a certain range of pulse lengths and frequencies. We present an analytical solution for the momentum spectrum of the constant rotating field. We find interference effects not only in the momentum spectrum but also in the total particle number of rotating electric fields.,14,[],4
1404.4733,hep-th,"We present a qualitatively new mechanism for dynamical spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry. Specifically, we construct a modified formulation of standard minimal N=1 supergravity. The modification is based on an idea worked out in detail in previous publications by some of us, where we proposed a new formulation of (non-supersymmetric) gravity theories employing an alternative volume form (volume element, or generally-covariant integration measure) in the pertinent Lagrangian action, defined in terms of auxiliary (pure-gauge) fields instead of the standard Riemannian metric volume form. Invariance under supersymmetry of the new modified N=1 supergravity action is preserved due to the addition of an appropriate compensating antisymmetric tensor gauge field. This new formalism naturally triggers the appearance of a dynamically generated cosmological constant as an arbitrary integration constant which signifies a spontaneous (dynamical) breaking of supersymmetry. Furthermore, applying the same formalism to anti-de Sitter supergravity allows us to appropriately choose the above mentioned arbitrary integration constant so as to obtain simultaneously a very small positive effective observable cosmological constant as well as a large physical gravitino mass as required by modern cosmological scenarios for slowly expanding universe of today.",14,['gr-qc'],4
1412.8478,hep-th,"The all-loop integrand for scattering amplitudes in planar N = 4 SYM is determined by an ""amplitude form"" with logarithmic singularities on the boundary of the amplituhedron. In this note we provide strong evidence for a new striking property of the superamplitude, which we conjecture to be true to all loop orders: the amplitude form is positive when evaluated inside the amplituhedron. The statement is sensibly formulated thanks to the natural ""bosonization"" of the superamplitude associated with the amplituhedron geometry. However this positivity is not manifest in any of the current approaches to scattering amplitudes, and in particular not in the cellulations of the amplituhedron related to on-shell diagrams and the positive grassmannian. The surprising positivity of the form suggests the existence of a ""dual amplituhedron"" formulation where this feature would be made obvious. We also suggest that the positivity is associated with an extended picture of amplituhedron geometry, with the amplituhedron sitting inside a co-dimension one surface separating ""legal"" and ""illegal"" local singularities of the amplitude. We illustrate this in several simple examples, obtaining new expressions for amplitudes not associated with any triangulations, but following in a more invariant manner from a global view of the positive geometry.",14,[],4
1402.2443,hep-th,"We summarize and expand our investigations concerning the soft graviton effects on microscopic matter dynamics in de Sitter space. The physical couplings receive IR logarithmic corrections which are sensitive to the IR cut-off at the one-loop level. The scale invariant spectrum in the gravitational propagator at the super-horizon scale is the source of the de Sitter symmetry breaking. The quartic scalar, Yukawa and gauge couplings become time dependent and diminish with time. In contrast, the Newton's constant increases with time. We clarify the physical mechanism behind these effects in terms of the conformal mode dynamics in analogy with 2d quantum gravity. We show that they are the inevitable consequence of the general covariance and lead to gauge invariant predictions. We construct a simple model in which the cosmological constant is self-tuned to vanish due to UV-IR mixing effect.

We also propose a very simple and natural non-abelian generalization with gauge group equation, which gives rise to equation Yang-Mills theory upon dimensional reduction.

We consider a specific regularization of the branes internal structures where the 5D brane can be considered thin with respect to the 4D one. We find exact solutions corresponding to pure tension source configurations on the thick 4D brane, and study perturbations at first order around these background solutions. To perform the perturbative analysis, we adopt a bulk-based approach and we express the equations in terms of gauge invariant and master variables using a 4D scalar-vector-tensor decomposition. We then propose an ansatz on the behaviour of the perturbation fields when the thickness of the 4D brane goes to zero, which corresponds to configurations where gravity remains finite everywhere in the thin limit of the 4D brane. We study the equations of motion using this ansatz, and show that they give rise to a consistent set of differential equations in the thin limit, from which the details of the internal structure of the 4D brane disappear. We conclude that the thin limit of the ""ribbon"" 4D brane inside the (already thin) 5D brane is well defined (at least when considering first order perturbations around pure tension configurations), and that the gravitational field on the 4D brane remains finite in the thin limit.

1408.4573,hep-th,"We report on a mean-field study of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry for Dirac fermions with contact interactions in the presence of chiral imbalance, which is modelled by nonzero chiral chemical potential. We point out that chiral imbalance lowers the vacuum energy of Dirac fermions, which leads to the increase of the renormalized chiral chemical potential upon chiral symmetry breaking. The critical coupling strength for the transition to the broken phase is slightly lowered as the chiral chemical potential is increased, and the transition itself becomes milder. Furthermore, we study the chiral magnetic conductivity in different phases and find that it grows both in the perturbative weak-coupling regime and in the strongly coupled phase with broken chiral symmetry. In the strong coupling regime the chiral magnetic effect is saturated by vector-like bound states (vector mesons) with mixed transverse polarizations. General pattern of meson mixing in the presence of chiral imbalance is also considered. We discuss the relevance of our study for Weyl semimetals and strongly interacting QCD matter.

Generically, their partition function receives non-perturbative corrections which are not captured by the 't Hooft expansion.

Differences between the two sets of duals are identified. Besides a different amount of supersymmetry (equation for KKLT and equation for LVS) we find that the LVS CFT dual has only one scalar operator with equation conformal dimension, corresponding to the volume modulus, whereas in KKLT the whole set of equation Kahler moduli have this property. Also, the maximal number of degrees of freedom is estimated to be larger in LVS than in KKLT duals.

It turns out that all ingredients entering the component action can be obtained almost algorithmically by using the nonlinear realizations approach. Within this approach, properly adapted to the construction of on-shell component actions, we pay much attention to broken supersymmetry. Doing so, we were able to write the action in terms of purely geometric objects (vielbeins and covariant derivatives of the physical bosonic components), covariant with respect to broken supersymmetry. It turns out that all terms of the higher orders in the fermions, are hidden inside these covariant derivatives and vielbeins. Moreover, the main part of the component action just mimics its bosonic cousin in which the ordinary space-time derivatives and the bosonic world volume are replaced by their covariant supersymmetric analogs. The Wess-Zumino term in the action, which does not exist in the bosonic case, can be also easily constructed in terms of reduced Cartan forms.

1405.6695,hep-th,"We present the complete family of solutions of 3D gravity (Lambda<0) with two asymptotically AdS exterior regions. The solutions are constructed from data at the two boundaries, which correspond to two independent and arbitrary stress tensors TR, \bar TR, and TL, \bar TL. The two exteriors are smoothly joined on to an interior region through a regular horizon. We find CFT duals of these geometries which are entangled states of two CFT's. We compute correlators between general operators at the two boundaries and find perfect agreement between CFT and bulk calculations. We calculate and match the CFT entanglement entropy (EE) with the holographic EE which involves geodesics passing through the wormhole. We also compute a holographic, non-equilibrium entropy for the CFT using properties of the regular horizon. The construction of the bulk solutions here uses an exact version of Brown-Henneaux type diffeomorphisms which are asymptotically nontrivial and transform the CFT states by two independent unitary operators on the two sides.

1412.5365,hep-th,"We use the asymptotic data at conformal null-infinity equation to formulate Weinberg's soft-photon theorem for Abelian gauge theories with massless charged particles.

In the presence of these symmetries, Poisson bracket between the gauge potentials is not well-defined. This does not pose an obstacle for the quantization of the radiative phase space, which proceeds by treating the conjugate electric field as the fundamental variable. Denoting by equation and equation as the group of gauge transformations at equation and equation respectively, Strominger has shown that a certain diagonal subgroup equation is the symmetry of the S-matrix and Weinberg's soft-photon theorem is the corresponding Ward identity.

This is the regime of interest for screening or Vainshtein mechanisms, and in inflationary models that rely on large kinetic terms. Next, we clarify the role played by the symmetries. While symmetries protect the form of the quantum corrections, theories equipped with more symmetries do not necessarily have a broader range of scales for which they are valid. We show this by deriving explicitly the regime of validity of the classical solutions for equation theories including Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) models, both in generic and for specific background field configurations. Indeed, we find that despite the existence of an additional symmetry, the DBI effective field theory has a regime of validity similar to an arbitrary equation theory.

1405.2107,math,"We introduce a framework for the design of finite element methods for two-dimensional moving boundary problems with prescribed boundary evolution that have arbitrarily high order of accuracy, both in space and in time.

The resulting method maintains an exact representation of the (prescribed) moving boundary at the discrete level, or an approximation of the appropriate order, yet is immune to large distortions of the mesh under large deformations of the domain.

However, in the unbounded setting, the space of multipliers has the structure of a *-algebra with nice properties concerning commutant and affiliation: it is a pre-GW*-algebra. And this correspondence between Hilbert algebras and its multipliers is functorial. Then, we can endow the Hilbert algebra with a nice topology constructed from unbounded multipliers. As we can see from the theory developed here, multipliers should be an important tool for the study of unbounded operator algebras.   We also formalize the remark that examples of non-formal deformation quantizations give rise to Hilbert algebras, by defining the concept of Hilbert deformation quantization (HDQ) and studying these deformations as well as their bounded and unbounded multipliers in a general way. Then, we reformulate the notion of covariance of a star-product in this framework of HDQ and multipliers, and we call it a symmetry of the HDQ. By using the multiplier topology of a symmetry, we are able to produce various functional spaces attached to the deformation quantization, like the generalization of Schwartz space, Sobolev spaces, Gracia-Bondia-Varilly spaces. Moreover, the non-formal star-exponential of the symmetry can be defined in full generality and has nice relations with these functional spaces.

A locally compact group G is said to have property (T*) if this mean is a weak* continuous functional. After proving that the groups SL(3,R), Sp(2,R), and the universal covering of Sp(2,R) have property (T*), we address the question which connected Lie groups have the AP. A technical problem that arises when considering this question from the point of view of the AP is that the semisimple part of the global Levi decomposition of a connected Lie group need not be closed. Because of an important permanence property of property (T*), this problem vanishes.

We observed that all the methods are stable and can keep the total probability, but have totally different long-time behaviors concerning with the conservation of expectation. We prove that any extra infinitesimal diffusion leads to a same artificial steady state. So upwind scheme does not work due to its intrinsic numerical viscosity.

1411.5883,math,"Shielding studies in neutron transport, with Monte Carlo codes, yield challenging problems of small-probability estimation. The particularity of these studies is that the small probability to estimate is formulated in terms of the distribution of a Markov chain, instead of that of a random vector in more classical cases. Thus, it is not straightforward to adapt classical statistical methods, for estimating small probabilities involving random vectors, to these neutron-transport problems. A recent interacting-particle method for small-probability estimation, relying on the Hastings-Metropolis algorithm, is presented. It is shown how to adapt the Hastings-Metropolis algorithm when dealing with Markov chains. A convergence result is also shown. Then, the practical implementation of the resulting method for small-probability estimation is treated in details, for a Monte Carlo shielding study. Finally, it is shown, for this study, that the proposed interacting-particle method considerably outperforms a simple-Monte Carlo method, when the probability to estimate is small.",14,['stat'],0

1403.1775,math-ph,"In this paper we continue investigation of the interior problem of tomography that was started in \citeBKT2. As is known, solving the interior problem with prior data specified on a finite collection of intervals equation is equivalent to analytic continuation of a function from equation to an open set equation. In the paper we prove that this analytic continuation can be obtained with the help of a simple explicit formula, which involves summation of a series. Our second result is that the operator of analytic continuation is not stable for any pair of Sobolev spaces regardless of how close the set equation is to equation. Our main tool is the singular value decomposition of the operator equation that arises when the interior problem is reduced to a problem of inverting the Hilbert transform from incomplete data. The asymptotics of the singular values and singular functions of equation, the latter being valid uniformly on compact subsets of the interior of equation, was obtained in \citeBKT2.

As a first step we construct a suitable unital *-algebra of observables whose generating functionals are characterized by a labelling space which is at the same time optimal and separating and fulfils the F-locality property. Subsequently we give a definition for these systems of Hadamard states and we investigate explicit examples. In the case of a single plate, it turns out that one can build algebraic states via a pull-back of those on the whole Minkowski spacetime, moreover inheriting from them the Hadamard property. When we consider instead two plates, algebraic states can be put in correspondence with those on flat spacetime via the so-called method of images, which we translate to the algebraic setting. For a massless scalar field we show that this procedure works perfectly for a large class of quasi-free states including the Poincar\'e vacuum and KMS states. Eventually Wick polynomials are introduced. Contrary to the Minkowski case, the extended algebras, built in globally hyperbolic subregions can be collected in a global counterpart only after a suitable deformation which is expressed locally in terms of a *-isomorphism.

In the elliptic case, it is found that the break-up is given by a cusp as for the semiclassical system of the focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation in equation dimensions. The full Toda system is then studied for finite small values of the dispersion parameter equation in the vicinity of the shocks of the dispersionless Toda equations. We determine the scaling in equation of the difference between the Toda solution for small equation and the singular solution of the dispersionless Toda system.

1409.4550,math-ph,"Classification of quantum spinor fields according to quantum bilinear covariants is introduced in a context of quantum Clifford algebras on Minkowski spacetime. Once the bilinear covariants are expressed in terms of algebraic spinor fields, the duality between spinor and quantum spinor fields is thus discussed. Hence, by endowing the underlying spacetime with an arbitrary bilinear form with a antisymmetric part in addition to a symmetric spacetime metric, quantum algebraic spinor fields and deformed bilinear covariants can be constructed. They are therefore compared to the classical (non quantum) ones. Classes of quantum spinor fields are introduced and compared with Lounesto's spinor field classification. A physical interpretation of the deformed parts and the underlying Z-grading is proposed. The existence of an arbitrary bilinear form endowing the spacetime already has been explored in the literature in the context of quantum gravity. Here, it is shown further to play a prominent role in the structure of Dirac, Weyl, and Majorana spinor fields, besides the most general flagpoles, dipoles and flag-dipoles ones as well. We introduce a new duality between the standard and the quantum spinor fields, by showing that when Clifford algebras over vector spaces endowed with an arbitrary bilinear form are taken into account, a mixture among the classes does occur. Consequently, novel features regarding the spinor fields can be derived.",14,"['hep-th', 'math']",3

The projection (or dimensional reduction) is achieved by integrating the diffusion equation along the cross sections of the channel contained in the planes orthogonal to the curve.

1409.0480,math-ph,"We introduce a new method for deriving the time-dependent Hartree or Hartree-Fock equations as an effective mean-field dynamics from the microscopic Schroedinger equation for fermionic many-particle systems in quantum mechanics. The method is an adaption of the method used in [Pickl, Lett. Math. Phys., 97(2):151-164, 2011] for bosonic systems to fermionic systems. It is based on a Gronwall type estimate for a suitable measure of distance between the microscopic solution and an antisymmetrized product state. We use this method to treat a new mean-field limit for fermions with long-range interactions in a large volume. Some of our results hold for singular attractive or repulsive interactions. We can also treat Coulomb interaction assuming either a mild singularity cutoff or certain regularity conditions on the solutions to the Hartree(-Fock) equations. In the considered limit, the kinetic and interaction energy are of the same order, while the average force is subleading. For some interactions, we prove that the Hartree(-Fock) dynamics is a more accurate approximation than a simpler dynamics that one would expect from the subleading force. With our method we also treat the mean-field limit coupled to a semiclassical limit, which was discussed in the literature before, and we recover some of the previous results.

1412.5925,math-ph,"Unbalanced probability circulation, which yields cyclic motions in phase space, is the defining characteristics of a stationary diffusion process without detailed balance. In over-damped soft matter systems, such behavior is a hallmark of the presence of a sustained external driving force accompanied with dissipations. In an under-damped and strongly correlated system, however, cyclic motions are often the consequences of a conservative dynamics. In the present paper, we give a novel interpretation of a class of diffusion processes with stationary circulation in terms of a Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium in which cyclic motions are on the level set of stationary probability density function thus non-dissipative, e.g., a supercurrent. This implies an orthogonality between stationary circulation equation and the gradient of stationary probability density equation. A sufficient and necessary condition for the orthogonality is a decomposition of the drift equation where equation and equation equation. Stationary processes with Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium has an underlying conservative dynamics equation equation, and a first integral equation const, akin to a Hamiltonian system. At all time, an instantaneous free energy balance equation exists for a given diffusion system; and an extended energy conservation law among a family of diffusion processes with different parameter equation can be established via a Helmholtz theorem. For the general diffusion process without the orthogonality, a nonequilibrium cycle emerges, which consists of external driven equation-ascending steps and spontaneous equation-descending movements, alternated with iso-equation motions.

In the case of the minimal value of the total angular momentum, equation, the radial equations are reduced to second-order ordinary differential equations, which are straightforwardly solved in terms of the hypergeometric functions. For non-zero values of the total angular momentum, however, the radial equations are reduced to a pair of complicated fourth-order differential equations. Employing the factorization approach, we derive the general solution of these equations involving four independent fundamental solutions written in terms of combinations of the hypergeometric functions. The corresponding discrete energy spectrum is then determined via termination of the involved hypergeometric series, resulting in quasi-polynomial wave-functions. The constructed solutions lead to notable observations when compared with those for the ordinary Dirac particle. The energy spectrum for the Dirac-Kahler particle in spherical space is much more complicated. Its structure substantially differs from that for the Dirac particle since it consists of two paralleled energy level series each of which is twofold degenerate. Besides, none of the two separate series coincides with the series for the Dirac particle. Thus, the Dirac--Kahler field cannot be interpreted as a system of four Dirac fermions.

But as mismatch in time scale increases, the systems have to compromise to a state of no oscillations. We illustrate this for standard nonlinear systems and identify the regions of quenched dynamics in the parameter plane.

The likelihood of such binary events -- the cornerstone also for the categoric (as opposed to probabilistic) prediction of threshold exceedences -- is established from long time series of one or more observables of the same system. The prediction skill is measured by a summary index of the ROC curve that relates the hit- and false alarm rates. Our results for the examined systems suggest that exceedances of higher thresholds are more predictable; or in other words: rare large magnitude, i.e., extreme, events are more predictable than frequent typical events. We find this to hold provided that the bin size for binning time series data is optimized, but not necessarily otherwise. This can be viewed as a confirmation of a counterintuitive (and seemingly contrafactual) statement that was previously formulated for more simple autoregressive stochastic processes. However, we argue that for dynamical systems in general it may be typical only, but not universally true. We argue that when there is a sufficient amount of data depending on the precision of observation, the skill of a class of data-driven categoric predictions of threshold exceedences approximates the skill of the analogous model-driven prediction, assuming strictly no model errors. Furthermore, we show that a quantity commonly regarded as a measure of predictability, the finite-time maximal Lyapunov exponent, does not correspond directly to the ROC-based measure of prediction skill when they are viewed as functions of the prediction lead time and the threshold level. This points to the fact that even if the Lyapunov exponent as an intrinsic property of the system, measuring the instability of trajectories, determines predictability, it does that in a nontrivial manner.",14,['physics'],9

1411.7178,nlin,"The Turing instability is a paradigmatic route to patterns formation in reaction-diffusion systems. Following a diffusion-driven instability, homogeneous fixed points can become unstable when subject to external perturbation. As a consequence, the system evolves towards a stationary, nonhomogeneous attractor. Stable patterns can be also obtained via oscillation quenching of an initially synchronous state of diffusively coupled oscillators. In the literature this is known as the oscillation death phenomenon. Here we show that oscillation death is nothing but a Turing instability for the first return map associated to the excitable system in its synchronous periodic state. In particular we obtain a set of closed conditions for identifying the domain in the parameters space that yields the instability. This is a natural generalisation of the original Turing relations, to the case where the homogeneous solution of the examined system is a periodic function of time. The obtained framework applies to systems embedded in continuum space, as well as those defined on a network-like support. The predictive ability of the theory is tested numerically, using different reaction schemes.",14,[],9

The method is based on a check of convergence for extreme value laws on finite datasets.

For agents with independent identically-distributed parameters and all-to-all coupling, we derive an analytic approximate coarse evolution-map for the expected average purchase. We then study the emergence of coarse fronts when spatial segregation is present in the relative perceived quality of products. We develop a novel Newton-Krylov method that is able to compute accurately and efficiently coarse fixed points when the underlying fine-scale dynamics is stochastic. The main novelty of the algorithm is in the elimination of the noise that is generated when estimating Jacobian-vector products using time-integration of perturbed initial conditions.

Smooth wall deformations are introduced in order to create underlying Lyapunov instability of rays and then destroy survived regular modes. Numerical full-wave simulations are performed for a reverberation chamber with corner hemispheres and (off-)center wall spherical caps.

During interactions we see solitons and soliton pairs generated that are not accelerating. In general, the higher the intensities of interacting beams, the easier to form solitons; when the intensities are small enough, no solitons are generated. Upon adjusting the interval between the launched beams, their interaction exhibits different properties.

1407.5487,nlin,"In this work, we consider systems that are subjected to intermittent instabilities due to external stochastic excitation. These intermittent instabilities, though rare, have a large impact on the probabilistic response of the system and give rise to heavy-tailed probability distributions. By making appropriate assumptions on the form of these instabilities, which are valid for a broad range of systems, we formulate a method for the analytical approximation of the probability distribution function (pdf) of the system response (both the main probability mass and the heavy-tail structure). In particular, this method relies on conditioning the probability density of the response on the occurrence of an instability and the separate analysis of the two states of the system, the unstable and stable state. In the stable regime we employ steady state assumptions, which lead to the derivation of the conditional response pdf using standard methods for random dynamical systems. The unstable regime is inherently transient and in order to analyze this regime we characterize the statistics under the assumption of an exponential growth phase and a subsequent decay phase until the system is brought back to the stable attractor. The method we present allows us to capture the statistics associated with the dynamics that give rise to heavy-tails in the system response and the analytical approximations compare favorably with direct Monte Carlo simulations, which we illustrate for two prototype intermittent systems: an intermittently unstable mechanical oscillator excited by correlated multiplicative noise and a complex mode in a turbulent signal with fixed frequency, where multiplicative stochastic damping and additive noise model interactions between various modes.",14,"['math', 'physics']",9

An asymptotic expression for the eigenvalues associated with the linear stability of these soliton families is also derived. This formula shows that one of these two soliton families near band edges is always unstable, while the other can be stable.

1403.3250,nlin,"We propose a minimal model of predator-swarm interactions which captures many of the essential dynamics observed in nature. Different outcomes are observed depending on the predator strength. For a ""weak"" predator, the swarm is able to escape the predator completely. As the strength is increased, the predator is able to catch up with the swarm as a whole, but the individual prey are able to escape by ""confusing"" the predator: the prey forms a ring with the predator at the center. For higher predator strength, complex chasing dynamics are observed which can become chaotic. For even higher strength, the predator is able to successfully capture the prey. Our model is simple enough to be amenable to a full mathematical analysis which is used to predict the shape of the swarm as well as the resulting predator-prey dynamics as a function of model parameters. We show that as the predator strength is increased, there is a transition (due to a Hopf bifurcation) from confusion state to chasing dynamics, and we compute the threshold analytically. Our analysis indicates that the swarming behaviour is not helpful in avoiding the predator, suggesting that there are other reasons why the species may swarm. The complex shape of the swarm in our model during the chasing dynamics is similar to the shape of a flock of sheep avoiding a shepherd.",14,"['math-ph', 'math', 'physics']",9
1403.6577,nlin,In this paper the two-dimensional Benney system describing long wave propagation of a finite depth fluid motion and the multi-dimensional Russo--Smereka kinetic equation describing a bubbly flow are considered. The Hamiltonian approach established by J. Gibbons for one-dimensional Vlasov kinetic equation is extended to a multi-dimensional case. A local Hamiltonian structure associated with the hydrodynamic lattice of moments derived by D.J. Benney is constructed. A relationship between this hydrodynamic lattice of moments and the two-dimensional Vlasov kinetic equation is found. In the two-dimensional case a Hamiltonian hydrodynamic lattice for the Russo--Smereka kinetic model is constructed. Simple hydrodynamic reductions are presented.,14,[],9
1405.6766,nlin,"As an unusual type of anomalous diffusion behavior, superballistic transport is not well known but has been experimentally simulated recently. Quantum superballistic transport models to date are mainly based on connected sublattices which are constructed to have different properties. In this work, we show that both quantum and classical superballistic transport in the momentum space can occur in a simple periodically driven Hamiltonian system, namely, a relativistic kicked-rotor system with a nonzero mass term. The nonzero mass term essentially realizes a junction-like scenario: regimes with low or high momentum values have different dispersion relations and hence different transport properties. It is further shown that the quantum and classical superballistic transport should occur under much different choices of the system parameters. The results are of interest to studies of anomalous transport, quantum and classical chaos, and the issue of quantum-classical correspondence.",14,[],9

In particular, using fixed point iterations, numerically exact lattice skyrmions are constructed; and their stability under small perturbations is explored by means of linear stability analysis. While stable branches of such solutions are identified, it is also shown that they possess a particularly delicate bifurcation structure, especially so in the vicinity of the continuum limit.

1402.1797,nlin,"We describe ideal incompressible hydrodynamics on the hyperbolic plane which is an infinite surface of constant negative curvature. We derive equations of motion, general symmetries and conservation laws, and then consider turbulence with the energy density linearly increasing with time due to action of small-scale forcing. In a flat space, such energy growth is due to an inverse cascade, which builds a constant part of the velocity autocorrelation function proportional to time and expanding in scales, while the moments of the velocity difference saturate during a time depending on the distance. For the curved space, we analyze the long-time long-distance scaling limit, that lives in a degenerate conical geometry, and find that the energy-containing mode linearly growing with time is not constant in space. The shape of the velocity correlation function indicates that the energy builds up in vortical rings of arbitrary diameter but of width comparable to the curvature radius of the hyperbolic plane. The energy current across scales does not increase linearly with the scale, as in a flat space, but reaches a maximum around the curvature radius. That means that the energy flux through scales decreases at larger scales so that the energy is transferred in a non-cascade way, that is the inverse cascade spills over to all larger scales where the energy pumped into the system is cumulated in the rings. The time-saturated part of the spectral density of velocity fluctuations contains a finite energy per unit area, unlike in the flat space where the time-saturated spectrum behaves as k-5/3.",14,"['cond-mat', 'hep-th', 'physics']",9

Systematic calculations with the ImQMD model show that the fluctuation-dissipation relation found in the symmetric head-on fusion reactions at energies just above the Coulomb barrier fades out when the incident energy increases. It turns out that this dynamical change with increasing incident energy is caused by a specific behavior of the friction parameter which directly depends on the microscopic dynamical process, i.e., on how the collective energy of the relative motion is transferred into the intrinsic excitation energy. It is shown microscopically that the energy dissipation in the fusion process is governed by two mechanisms: One is caused by the nucleon exchanges between two fusing nuclei, and the other is due to a rearrangement of nucleons in the intrinsic system. The former mechanism monotonically increases the dissipative energy and shows a weak dependence on the incident energy, while the latter depends on both the relative distance between two fusing nuclei and the incident energy.

1405.7961,nucl-th,"We provide a detailed discussion of the low-energy proton-deuteron system in pionless effective field theory, considering both the spin-quartet and doublet S-wave channels. Extending and amending our previous work on the subject, we calculate the 3He-3H binding energy difference both perturbatively (using properly normalized trinucleon wave functions) and non-perturbatively by resumming all O(alpha) Coulomb diagrams in the doublet channel. Our nonperturbative result agrees well with a calculation that involves the full off-shell Coulomb T-matrix. Carefully examining the cutoff-dependence in the doublet channel, we present numerical evidence for a new three-nucleon counterterm being necessary at next-to-leading order if Coulomb effects are included. Indeed, such a term has recently been identified analytically. We furthermore make a case for a simplified Coulomb power counting that is consistent throughout the bound-state and scattering regimes.

1410.8690,nucl-th,"Fluctuations in the initial transverse energy-density distribution lead to anisotropic flows as observed in central high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Studies of longitudinal fluctuations of the anisotropic flows can shed further light on the initial conditions and dynamical evolution of the hot quark-gluon matter in these collisions. Correlations between anisotropic flows with varying pseudorapidity gaps in PbPb collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider are investigated using both an event-by-event (31)-D ideal hydrodynamical model with fluctuating initial conditions and the a multiphase transport (AMPT) Monte Carlo model for high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Anisotropic flows at different pseudorapidities are found to become significantly decorrelated with increasing pseudo-rapidity gaps due to longitudinal fluctuations in the initial states of heavy-ion collisions. The longitudinal correlation of the elliptic flow shows a strong centrality dependence while the correlation of the triangular flow is independent of the centrality. Longitudinal fluctuations as a source of the decorrelation are further shown to consist of a twist or gradual rotation in flow angles between the forward and backward direction and additional fluctuations on top of the twist. Within the AMPT model, longitudinal correlations of anisotropic flows are also found to depend on the value of partonic cross sections. The implicatiosn of constraining the initial conditions and shear viscosity to entropy density ratio of the partonic matter in high-energy heavy-ion collisions are also discussed.",14,['hep-ph'],11

The mass of a jet, as measured by jet reconstruction algorithms, is constrained by the jet's virtuality, which in turn has a considerable effect on such observables as the fragmentation function and jet shape observables. The leading parton, propagating through a dense medium, experiences substantial virtuality (or mass) depletion along with energy loss. Meaningful comparisons between surviving jets and jets produced in equation-equation collisions require mass depletion to be taken into account. Using a vacuum event generator, we show the close relationship between the actual jet mass and that after applying a jet reconstruction algorithm. Using an in-medium event generator, we demonstrate the clear difference between the mass of a surviving parton exiting a dense medium and a parton with a similar energy formed in a hard scattering event. Effects of this difference on jet observables are discussed.",14,"['hep-ph', 'nucl-ex']",11
1411.2906,nucl-th,"The standard kinematic method for determining neutrino mass from the beta decay of tritium or other isotope is to measure the shape of the electron spectrum near the endpoint. It has been known for 30 years that a similar distortion of the ""visible energy"" remaining after electron capture is caused by neutrino mass. There has been a resurgence of interest in using this method with 163-Ho. Recent theoretical analyses offer reassurance that there are no significant theoretical uncertainties. We show that the situation is, however, more complicated, and that the spectrum shape is presently not well enough understood to permit a sensitive determination of the neutrino mass in this way. The theoretical analyses consider only single vacancy states in the daughter 163-Dy atom. It is necessary to consider configurations with more than one vacancy that can be populated owing to the change in nuclear charge. The shakeup and shakeoff theory of Carlson and Nestor is used as a basis for estimating the population of double-vacancy states. A spectrum of satellites associated with each primary vacancy created by electron capture is presented. The theory of the calorimetric spectrum is more complicated than has been described heretofore.

We discuss the spectroscopic information carried by the new data. In particular, candidates for the experimentally observed equation transitions in equationMt are proposed. We find that the presence and nature of low-energy equation transitions in well-deformed nuclei around equation strongly depends on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling; hence, it provides an excellent constraint on theoretical models of superheavy nuclei.

We calculate the A dependences of the absolute and relative (transparency ratio) charmonium yields as well as its excitation function within the different scenarios for the J/PsiN absorption cross section, for the J/Psi formation length and for J/Psi in-medium modification. We demonstrate that the former observables, on the one hand, are not practically affected by the charmonium formation length effects and, on the other hand, they are appreciably sensitive to the genuine J/PsiN absorption cross section at beam energies of interest, which means that these observables can be useful to help determine the above cross section from the comparison of the results of our calculations with the future data from the CBM experiment at FAIR-the upcoming accelerator facility at GSI-Darmstadt, Germany.

1406.7789,nucl-th,The influence of short-range correlations on the spectral distribution of neutrons is incorporated in the solution of the gap equation for the equation coupled channel in pure neutron matter. This effect is studied for different realistic interactions including one based on chiral perturbation theory. The gap in this channel vanishes at all relevant densities due to the treatment of these correlations. We also consider the effect of long-range correlations by including polarization terms in addition to the bare interaction which allow the neutrons to exchange density and spin fluctuations governed by the strength of Landau parameters allowed to have reasonable values consistent with the available literature. Preliminary results indicate that reasonable values of these parameters do not generate a gap in the equation coupled channel either for all three realistic interactions although the pairing interaction becomes slightly more attractive.,14,[],11

The maximum mass and redshift predictions of anisotropic neutron star with hyperonic core are quite compatible with the result of recent observational constraints if we use the parameter of anisotropic pressure model equation[1] and equation [2]. The radius of the corresponding neutron star at equation=1.4 equation is more than 13 km, while the effect of anisotropic pressure on the minimum mass of neutron star is insignificant.

1403.0366,nucl-th,"We investigate the magicity of the isotopes equationCa and equationCa, that was recently confirmed by two experimental measurements, and relate it to like--particle and neutron--proton tensor effects within a mean--field description. By analyzing Ca isotopes, we show that the like--particle tensor contribution induces shell effects that render these nuclei more magic than they would be predicted by neglecting it. In particular, such induced shell effects are stronger in the nucleus equationCa and the single--particle gaps are increased in both isotopes due to the tensor force. By studying equation and equation isotones, neutron--proton tensor effects may be isolated and their role analyzed. It is shown that neutron--proton tensor effects lead to increasing equation and equation gaps, when going along isotonic chains, from equationFe to equationCa, and from equationFe to equationCa, respectively.   The mean--field calculations are perfomed by employing one Skyrme parameter set, that was introduced in a previous work by fitting the tensor parameters together with the spin--orbit strength. The signs and the values of the tensor strengths are thus checked within this specific application. The obtained results indicate that the employed parameter set, even if generated with a partial adjustment of the parameters of the force, leads to the correct shell behavior and provides, in particular, a description of the magicity of equationCa and equationCa within a pure mean--field picture with the effective two--body Skyrme interaction.",14,[],11

Our calculations are completely based on general relativity and especially the structure of neutron stars is obtained by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations with nuclear matter equation of state constrained by terrestrial experiments. We find that, by considering the more realistic neutron star model rather than a simple uniform neutron sphere as usual, the equation bounds from old neutron stars can be varied by more than an order of magnitude depending on the specific values of the DM neutron-to-proton coupling ratio equation, and they can be further varied by more than a factor of two depending on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. In particular, we demonstrate that the observed nearby isolated old neutron star PSR B125712 can set a very strong limit on equation for low-mass DM particles (equation) that reaches a sensitivity beyond the current best limits from direct detection experiments and disfavors the DM interpretation of previously-reported positive experimental results, including the IVDM.",14,"['astro-ph', 'hep-ph', 'nucl-ex']",11

This type of scale is more appropriate for interpolation purposes and of greater utility for simulation codes. The calculations are done using the pn-QRPA theory using a separable interaction.

Purpose: We propose a new method to regularize the MR EDFs, which is based on using auxiliary quantities obtained by multiplying the kernels with appropriate powers of overlaps.   Methods: Regularized matrix elements of two-body interactions are obtained by integrating the auxiliary quantities and then solving simple linear equations.   Results: We implement the new regularization method within the self-consistent Skyrme-Hartree-Fock approach and we perform a proof-of-principle angular-momentum projection (AMP) of states in odd-odd nucleus 26Al. We show that for EDFs generated by true interactions, our regularization method gives results identical to those obtained within the standard AMP procedure. We also show that for EDFs that do not correspond to true interactions, it gives stable and converging results that are different than unstable and non-converging standard AMP values.

In recent years fluid dynamical processes became a dominant direction of research in high energy heavy ion reactions. The Quark-gluon Plasma formed in these reactions has low viscosity, which leads to significant fluctuations and turbulent instabilities. One has to study and separate these two effects, but this is not done yet in a systematic way.

1407.7122,nucl-th,"The angular distribution of the phase space arising in two-particle emission reactions induced by electrons and neutrinos is computed in the laboratory (Lab) system by boosting the isotropic distribution in the center of mass (CM) system used in Monte Carlo generators. The Lab distribution has a singularity for some angular values, coming from the Jacobian of the angular transformation between CM and Lab systems. We recover the formula we obtained in a previous calculation for the Lab angular distribution. This is in accordance with the Monte Carlo method used to generate two-particle events for neutrino scattering\citeSob12. Inversely, by performing the transformation to the CM system, it can be shown that the phase-space function, which is proportional to the two particle-two hole (2p-2h) hadronic tensor for a constant current operator, can be computed analytically in the frozen nucleon approximation, if Pauli blocking is absent.

A chiral equation potential together with phenomenological models of equation interaction with one- and two-pole structure of the equation resonance were used. All three potentials reproduce experimental data on low-energy equation scattering and kaonic hydrogen with the same level of accuracy. New method of calculating the subthreshold resonance position and width in a three-body system was proposed and used together with the direct search of the resonance pole. We obtained binding energy of the equation quasi-bound state equation MeV with the chirally motivated and equation MeV with the phenomenological equation potentials. The width is about equation MeV for the two-pole models of the interaction, while the one-pole potential gives equation MeV width.

Considering both of these models one by one we do not find the conclusive evidences in favor of any of them. The controversial results appear because of rather different sensitivities of the pressure and energy density to both excluded volume and Hagedorn mass spectrum effects.

The surveys lay out a clear indicator of the rise of extreme views. The precursor is a nonlinear relation between the fraction of individuals holding a certain extreme view and the fraction of individuals that includes also moderates, e.g., in politics, those who are ""very conservative"" versus ""moderate to very conservative"" ones. We propose an activation model of opinion dynamics with interaction rules based on the existence of individual ""stubbornness"" that mimics empirical observations. According to our modeling, the onset of nonlinearity can be associated to an abrupt bootstrap-percolation transition with cascades of extreme views through society. Therefore, it represents an early-warning signal to forecast the transition from moderate to extreme views.

1403.1546,physics,"The interactions among the elementary components of many complex systems can be qualitatively different. Such systems are therefore naturally described in terms of multiplex or multi-layer networks, i.e. networks where each layer stands for a different type of interaction between the same set of nodes. There is today a growing interest in understanding when and why a description in terms of a multiplex network is necessary and more informative than a single-layer projection. Here, we contribute to this debate by presenting a comprehensive study of correlations in multiplex networks. Correlations in node properties, especially degree-degree correlations, have been thoroughly studied in single-layer networks. Here we extend this idea to investigate and characterize correlations between the different layers of a multiplex network. Such correlations are intrinsically multiplex, and we first study them empirically by constructing and analyzing several multiplex networks from the real-world. In particular, we introduce various measures to characterize correlations in the activity of the nodes and in their degree at the different layers, and between activities and degrees. We show that real-world networks exhibit indeed non-trivial multiplex correlations. For instance, we find cases where two layers of the same multiplex network are positively correlated in terms of node degrees, while other two layers are negatively correlated. We then focus on constructing synthetic multiplex networks, proposing a series of models to reproduce the correlations observed empirically and/or to assess their relevance.",14,['cs'],5

Our study reveals that the inverse of the largest eigenvalue of the non-backtracking matrix of the graph often provides a tight lower bound for true percolation threshold. However, in more than 40% of the cases, this indicator is less predictive than the naive expectation value based solely on the moments of the degree distribution. We find that the performance of all indicators becomes worse as the value of the true percolation threshold grows. Thus, none of them represents a good proxy for robustness of extremely fragile networks.",14,['cond-mat'],5

A two-energy-scale approach leads to a self-consistent modeling of the coupling between suprathermal alpha-particles and the thermal bulk of the imploding plasma.

We first show that existing approaches are incompatible with our extensive measurements of cell reorientation. We then propose a fundamentally new theory that shows that dissipative relaxation of the cell's passively-stored, two-dimensional, elastic energy to its minimum actively drives the reorientation process.

However, complex system dynamics based on pure metric or pure topological distances both face physical inconsistencies in low and high density situations. Here, we propose a hybrid metric-topological interaction distance overcoming these issues and enabling a real-life implementation in artificial robotic swarms. We use network- and graph-theoretic approaches combined with a dynamical model of locally interacting self-propelled particles to study the consensus reaching pro- cess for a swarm ruled by this hybrid interaction distance.

We show that large fluctuation theory may be applied for controlling autonomous agents in a stochastic environment, in fact leveraging the stochastic- ity to the advantage of switching between regions of interest and concluding that patterns may be broken or held over time as the result of noise. We demonstrate that a controller can effectively manipulate the probability of a large fluctuation, thereby modifying escape times exponentially; this demonstrates the potential of optimal control strategies that work in combination with the endemic stochastic environment. To demonstrate this, stochastic simulations and numerical continuation are employed to tie together experimental findings with predictions.",14,[],5
1408.3313,physics,"High gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) is an efficient way to remove magnetic and paramagnetic particles, such as heavy metals, from waste water. As the suspension flows through a magnetized filter mesh, high magnetic gradients around the wires attract and capture the particles, removing them from the fluid. We model such a system by considering the motion of a paramagnetic tracer particle through a periodic array of magnetized cylinders. We show that there is a critical Mason number (ratio of viscous to magnetic forces) below which the particle is captured irrespective of its initial position in the array. Above this threshold, particle capture is only partially successful and depends on the particle's entry position. We determine the relationship between the critical Mason number and the system geometry using numerical and asymptotic calculations. If a capture efficiency below 100% is sufficient, our results demonstrate how operating the HGMS system above the critical Mason number but with multiple separation cycles may increase efficiency.",14,[],5

Using simplicial complexes representation of graphs, we investigate in-depth topology of online social network which is based on MySpace dialogs. The network exhibits original community structure. In addition, we simulate emotion spreading in this network that enables to identify two emotion-propagating layers. The analysis resulting in three structure vectors quantifies the graph's architecture at different topology levels. Notably, structures emerging through shared links, triangles and tetrahedral faces, frequently occur and range from tree-like to maximal 5-cliques and their respective complexes. On the other hand, the structures which spread only negative or only positive emotion messages appear to have much simpler topology consisting of links and triangles. Furthermore, we introduce the node's structure vector which represents the number of simplices at each topology level in which the node resides. The total number of such simplices determines what we define as the node's topological dimension. The presented results suggest that the node's topological dimension provides a suitable measure of the social capital which measures the agent's ability to act as a broker in compact communities, the so called Simmelian brokerage. We also generalize the results to a wider class of computer-generated networks.

1406.3432,physics,"The currently existing theory of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy(FCS) is based on the linear fluctuation theory originally developed by Einstein, Onsager, Lax, and others as a phenomenological approach to equilibrium fluctuations in bulk solutions. For mesoscopic reaction-diffusion systems with nonlinear chemical reactions among a small number of molecules, a situation often encountered in single-cell biochemistry, it is expected that FCS time correlation functions of a reaction-diffusion system can deviate from the classic results of Elson and Magde. We first discuss this nonlinear effect for reaction systems without diffusion. For nonlinear stochastic reaction-diffusion systems here are no closed solutions; therefore, stochastic Monte-Carlo simulations are carried out. We show that the deviation is small for a simple bimolecular reaction; the most significant deviations occur when the number of molecules is small and of the same order. Our results show that current linear FCS theory could be adequate for measurements on biological systems that contain many other sources of uncertainties. At the same time it provides a framework for future measurements of nonlinear, fluctuating chemical reactions with high-precision FCS.

Based on analytic calculations and numerical simulations, we show that if the stationary bursty process is governed by power-law IETD, the spreading can be slowed down or accelerated as compared to a Poisson process; the speed is determined by the short time behaviour, which in our model is controlled by the exponent. We demonstrate that finite, so called ""locally tree-like"" networks, like the Barab\'asi-Albert networks behave very differently from real tree graphs if the IETD is strongly fat-tailed, as the lack or presence of rare alternative paths modifies the spreading. A further important result is that the non-stationarity of the dynamics has a significant effect on the spreading speed for strongly fat-tailed power-law IETDs, thus bursty processes characterized by small power-law exponents can cause slow spreading in the stationary state but also very rapid spreading heavily depending on the age of the processes.",14,[],5

It is demonstrated that for a dielectric middle layer with a thickness of a few tens of nanometers and a sidewall plasmonic coating of more than ten nanometers, the usual optical magnetic resonance modes are eliminated, and only magnetic toroid-like modes are sustainable in the infrared and visible regime. All of these deep-subwavelength modes can be interpreted as an interference effect from the gap surface plasmon polaritons. Our results will be useful in nanoantenna design, high-Q cavity sensing, structured light-beam generation, and photon emission engineering.",14,[],5
1401.5648,physics,"Nodes can be ranked according to their relative importance within the network. Ranking algorithms based on random walks are particularly useful because they connect topological and diffusive properties of the network. Previous methods based on random walks, as for example the PageRank, have focused on static structures. However, several realistic networks are indeed dynamic, meaning that their structure changes in time. In this paper, we propose a centrality measure for temporal networks based on random walks which we call TempoRank. While in a static network, the stationary density of the random walk is proportional to the degree or the strength of a node, we find that in temporal networks, the stationary density is proportional to the in-strength of the so-called effective network. The stationary density also depends on the sojourn probability q which regulates the tendency of the walker to stay in the node. We apply our method to human interaction networks and show that although it is important for a node to be connected to another node with many random walkers at the right moment (one of the principles of the PageRank), this effect is negligible in practice when the time order of link activation is included.",14,['cs'],5
1402.6664,physics,"Simple assumptions represent a decisive reason to prefer one theory to another in everyday scientific praxis. But this praxis has little philosophical justification, since there exist many notions of simplicity, and those that can be defined precisely strongly depend on the language in which the theory is formulated. The language dependence is a natural feature - to some extent - but it is also believed to be a fatal problem, because, according to a common general argument, the simplicity of a theory is always trivial in a suitably chosen language. But, this trivialization argument is typically either applied to toy-models of scientific theories or applied with little regard for the empirical content of the theory. This paper shows that the trivialization argument fails, when one considers realistic theories and requires their empirical content to be preserved. In fact, the concepts that enable a very simple formulation, are not necessarily measurable, in general. Moreover, the inspection of a theory describing a chaotic billiard shows that precisely those concepts that naturally make the theory extremely simple are provably not measurable. This suggests that - whenever a theory possesses sufficiently complex consequences - the constraint of measurability prevents too simple formulations in any language. This explains why the scientists often regard their assessments of simplicity as largely unambiguous. In order to reveal a cultural bias in the scientists' assessment, one should explicitly identify different characterizations of simplicity of the assumptions that lead to different theory selections. General arguments are not sufficient.",14,[],5

This study was carried out on a four quantum well active region design with photon energy of 14.3 meV processed both with Au and Cu waveguides. The heterostructure operates up to 148 K at B=0 T and in a Cu waveguide. The complete magneto-spectroscopic study allowed the comparison of emission and transport data. Increasing the magnetic field, the low effective mass of the InGaAs wells allowed us to reach the very strong confinement regime. At B=12 T, where the cyclotron transition is almost resonant with the LO-phonon, we recorded a maximum operating temperature of 195 K for the devices with Cu waveguide.

The effect is similar for fine grain and single crystal niobium and all surface treatments including electropolishing with and without 120equationC baking and nitrogen doping.

1401.2821,physics,"The notion of instability of a turbulent flow is introduced in the case of a von K\'arm\'an flow thanks to the monitoring of the spatio-temporal spectrum of the velocity fluctuations, combined with projection onto suitable Beltrami modes. It is shown that the large scale coherent fluctuations of the flow obeys a sequence of Eckhaus instabilities when the Reynolds number equation is varied from equation to equation. This sequence results in modulations of increasing azimuthal wavenumber. The basic state is the laminar or time-averaged flow at an arbitrary equation, which is axi-symmetric, i.e. with a equation azimuthal wavenumber. Increasing equation leads to non-axisymmetric modulations with increasing azimuthal wavenumber from equation to equation. These modulations are found to rotate in the azimuthal direction. However no clear rotation frequency can be established until equation. Above, they become periodic with an increasing frequency. We finally show that these modulations are connected with the coherent structures of the mixing shear layer. The implication of these findings for the turbulence parametrization is discussed. Especially, they may explain why simple eddy viscosity models are able to capture complex turbulent flow dynamics.",14,['cond-mat'],5

1402.4230,physics,"This paper is aimed to contribute to the scientific discussions that have been triggered by the experimental observation of a quadratic relation between the kurtosis and skewness of turbulent fluctuations present in fusion plasmas and other nonlinear physical systems. In this paper we offer a general statistical model which attributes the observed equation relation to the varying intermittency of the experimental signals. The model is a two random variable model constructed to catch the essential intermittent feature of the real signal. One of the variables is the amplitude of the underlying intermittent event (e.g. turbulent structure) while the other is connected to the intermittency level of the system. This simple model can attribute physical meaning to the equation and equation coefficients, as they characterize the spatio-temporal statistics of intermittent events.

We compute the thermodynamic behavior of a system defined on the network, the equationrotors model, and monitor how it is affected by the topological changes. We identify the network dimension equation as a crucial parameter: topologies with equation exhibit no phase transitions while ones with equation display a second order phase transition. Topologies with equation exhibit states characterized by infinite susceptibility and macroscopic chaotic/turbulent dynamical behavior. These features are also captured by equation in the finite size context.",14,['cond-mat'],5

We characterize the performance of two sets of approximate constraints, (2,2)-positivity (DQG) and approximate (2,3)-positivity (DQGT) conditions, at capturing correlation in one-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional (ladder) Hubbard models. We find that, while both the DQG and DQGT conditions capture both the weak and strong correlation limits, the more stringent DQGT conditions improve the ground-state energies, the natural occupation numbers, the pair correlation function, the effective hopping, and the connected (cumulant) part of the 2-RDM.

1405.0841,physics,"Plasma flow is damped in stellarators because they are not intrinsically ambipolar, unlike tokamaks, in which the flux-surface averaged radial electric current vanishes for any value of the radial electric field. Only quasisymmetric stellarators are intrinsically ambipolar, but exact quasisymmetry is impossible to achieve in non-axisymmetric toroidal configurations. By calculating the violation of intrinsic ambipolarity due to deviations from quasisymmetry, one can derive criteria to assess when a stellarator can be considered quasisymmetric in practice, i.e. when the flow damping is weak enough. Let us denote by equation a small parameter that controls the size of a perturbation to an exactly quasisymmetric magnetic field. Recently, it has been shown that if the gradient of the perturbation is sufficiently small, the flux-surface averaged radial electric current scales as equation for any value of the collisionality. It was also argued that when the gradient of the perturbation is large, the quadratic scaling is replaced by a more unfavorable one. In this paper, perturbations with large gradients are rigorously treated.

The results in the case in which awareness implies total immunization to the disease, revealed the existence of a metacritical point at which the critical onset of the epidemics starts depending on the reaching of the awareness process. Here we present a full analysis of these critical properties in the more general scenario where the awareness spreading does not imply total immunization, and where infection does not imply immediate awareness of it. We find the critical relation between both competing processes for a wide spectrum of parameters representing the interaction between them. We also analyze the consequences of a massive broadcast of awareness (mass media) on the final outcome of the epidemic incidence. Importantly enough, the mass media makes the metacritical point to disappear.

1409.4581,physics,"Rugged energy landscapes find wide applications in diverse fields ranging from astrophysics to protein folding. We study the dependence of diffusion coefficient equation of a Brownian particle on the distribution width equation of randomness in a Gaussian random landscape by simulations and theoretical analysis. We first show that the elegant expression of Zwanzig [PNAS, 85, 2029 (1988)] for equation can be reproduced exactly by using the Rosenfeld diffusion-entropy scaling relation. Our simulations show that Zwanzig's expression overestimates equation in an uncorrelated Gaussian random lattice - differing by almost an order of magnitude at moderately high ruggedness. The disparity originates from the presence of ""three-site traps"" (TST) on the landscape -- which are formed by the presence of deep minima flanked by high barriers on either side. Using mean first passage time formalism, we derive a general expression for the effective diffusion coefficient in the presence of TST, that quantitatively reproduces the simulation results and which reduces to Zwanzig's form only in the limit of infinite spatial correlation. We construct a continuous Gaussian field with inherent correlation to establish the effect of spatial correlation on random walk. The presence of TSTs at large ruggedness equation give rise to an apparent breakdown of ergodicity of the type often encountered in glassy liquids.",14,['cond-mat'],5

We couple a semiconductor drift-diffusion model to a magnetic field in order to describe the electromagnetic effects associated with electrical currents flowing within rocks. The resulting system of equations is solved numerically and it is seen that a volume of rock may act as a diode that produces transient currents when it switches bias. These unidirectional currents are expected to produce transient unipolar magnetic pulses similar in form, amplitude, and duration to those observed before earthquakes, and this suggests that the pulses could be the result of geophysical semiconductor processes.",14,['cond-mat'],5

Combining micromagnetic simulations with forward flux sampling (FFS), a computational method for rare events that has been recently applied to the magnetic nanostructures, we have determined thermal escape rates and attempt frequencies of a graded media grain and two single phase grains of the same geometry. We find that graded anisotropy can increase the thermal stability of a grain by 12 orders of magnitudes from tens of milliseconds to centuries without changing the coercive field.",14,['cond-mat'],5

1407.3548,q-bio,"Because mutations are mostly deleterious, mutation rates should be reduced by natural selection. However, mutations also provide the raw material for adaptation. Therefore, evolutionary theory suggests that the mutation rate must balance between adaptability - the ability to adapt - and adaptedness - the ability to remain adapted. We model an asexual population crossing a fitness valley and analyze the rate of complex adaptation with and without stress-induced mutagenesis - the increase of mutation rates in response to stress or maladaptation. We show that stress-induced mutagenesis increases the rate of complex adaptation without reducing the population mean fitness, thus breaking the evolutionary trade-off between adaptability and adaptedness. Our theoretical results support the hypothesis that stress-induced mutagenesis promotes adaptation and provide quantitative predictions of the rate of complex adaptation with different mutational strategies.",14,[],10

This confirms earlier work of Jover et al \citeJover who raised the issue of whether nested infection networks are permanent.

1404.1421,q-bio,"Evolutionary game theory has become one of the most diverse and far reaching theories in biology. Applications of this theory range from cell dynamics to social evolution. However, many applications make it clear that inherent non-linearities of natural systems need to be taken into account. One way of introducing such non-linearities into evolutionary games is by the inclusion of multiple players. An example is of social dilemmas, where group benefits could e.g.\ increase less than linear with the number of cooperators. Such multiplayer games can be introduced in all the fields where evolutionary game theory is already well established. However, the inclusion of non-linearities can help to advance the analysis of systems which are known to be complex, e.g. in the case of non-Mendelian inheritance. We review the diachronic theory and applications of multiplayer evolutionary games and present the current state of the field. Our aim is a summary of the theoretical results from well-mixed populations in infinite as well as finite populations. We also discuss examples from three fields where the theory has been successfully applied, ecology, social sciences and population genetics.

1403.6384,q-bio,"The use of EEG biometrics, for the purpose of automatic people recognition, has received increasing attention in the recent years. Most of current analysis rely on the extraction of features characterizing the activity of single brain regions, like power-spectrum estimates, thus neglecting possible temporal dependencies between the generated EEG signals. However, important physiological information can be extracted from the way different brain regions are functionally coupled. In this study, we propose a novel approach that fuses spectral coherencebased connectivity between different brain regions as a possibly viable biometric feature. The proposed approach is tested on a large dataset of subjects (N=108) during eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) resting state conditions. The obtained recognition performances show that using brain connectivity leads to higher distinctiveness with respect to power-spectrum measurements, in both the experimental conditions. Notably, a 100% recognition accuracy is obtained in EC and EO when integrating functional connectivity between regions in the frontal lobe, while a lower 97.41% is obtained in EC (96.26% in EO) when fusing power spectrum information from centro-parietal regions.

We have used growing microcolonies of the bacterium \emphEscherichia coli to investigate the role of mechanical forces in the transition from two-dimensional growth (on the interface between a hard surface and a soft agarose pad) to three-dimensional growth (invasion of the agarose). We measure the position within the colony where the invasion transition happens, the cell density within the colony, and the colony size at the transition as functions of the concentration of the agarose. We use a phenomenological theory, combined with individual-based computer simulations, to show how mechanical forces acting between the bacterial cells, and between the bacteria and the surrounding matrix, lead to the complex phenomena observed in our experiments - in particular a non-trivial dependence of the colony size at the transition on the agarose concentration. Matching these approaches leads to a prediction for how the friction coefficient between the bacteria and the agarose should vary with agarose concentration. Our experimental conditions mimic numerous clinical and environmental scenarios in which bacteria invade soft matrices, as well as shedding more general light on the transition between two- and three-dimensional growth in multicellular assemblies.",14,['cond-mat'],10
1407.6340,q-bio,"Translation is an important stage in gene expression. During this stage, macro-molecules called ribosomes travel along the mRNA strand linking amino-acids together in a specific order to create a functioning protein. An important question is how to maximize protein production. Indeed, translation is known to consume most of the cell's energy and it is natural to assume that evolution shaped this process so that it maximizes the protein production rate. If this is indeed so then one can estimate various parameters of the translation machinery by solving an appropriate mathematical optimization problem. The same problem also arises in the context of synthetic biology, namely, re-engineer heterologous genes in order to maximize their translation rate in a host organism. We consider the problem of maximizing the protein production rate using a computational model for translation-elongation called the ribosome flow model (RFM). This model describes the flow of the ribosomes along an mRNA chain of length n using a set of n first-order nonlinear ODEs. It also includes n1 positive parameters: the ribosomal initiation rate into the mRNA chain, and n elongation rates along the chain sites. We show that the steady-state translation rate in the RFM is a strictly concave function of its parameters. This means that the problem of maximizing the translation rate under a suitable constraint always admits a unique solution, and that this solution can be determined using highly-efficient algorithms for solving convex optimization problems even for large values of n. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the optimal translation rate can be computed based only on the optimal initiation rate and the elongation rate of the codons near the beginning of the ORF. We discuss some applications of the theoretical results to synthetic biology, molecular evolution, and functional genomics.",14,[],10

Different types of mutations in the gene coding translates into defunct proteins cause different neuro-muscular diseases. Defunct protein interactions in human proteome may cause a stress to its neighboring proteins and its modules. We therefore aimed to understand the effects of mutated proteins on interacting partners in different muscular dystrophies utilizing network biology to understand system properties of these MDs subnetworks .We investigated rigidity and flexibility of protein-protein interaction subnetworks associated with causative mutated genes showing high mean interference values in muscular dystrophy. Rigid component related to EEF1A1 subnetwork and members of 14.3.3 protein family formed the core of network showed involvement in molecular function related to protein domain specific binding. CACNA1S and CALM1 showing functionality related to Voltage-dependent calcium channel demonstrated highest flexibility. The interconnected subnets of proteins corresponding to known causative genes having large genetic variants are shared in different muscular dystrophies inferred towards comorbidity in diseases. The studies demonstrates core network of MDs as highly rigid, constituting of large intermodular edges and interconnected hub nodes suggesting high information transfer flow.

1404.0329,q-bio,"A main challenge of data-driven sciences is how to make maximal use of the progressively expanding databases of experimental datasets in order to keep research cumulative. We introduce the idea of a modeling-based dataset retrieval engine designed for relating a researcher's experimental dataset to earlier work in the field. The search is (i) data-driven to enable new findings, going beyond the state of the art of keyword searches in annotations, (ii) modeling-driven, to both include biological knowledge and insights learned from data, and (iii) scalable, as it is accomplished without building one unified grand model of all data. Assuming each dataset has been modeled beforehand, by the researchers or by database managers, we apply a rapidly computable and optimizable combination model to decompose a new dataset into contributions from earlier relevant models. By using the data-driven decomposition we identify a network of interrelated datasets from a large annotated human gene expression atlas. While tissue type and disease were major driving forces for determining relevant datasets, the found relationships were richer and the model-based search was more accurate than keyword search; it moreover recovered biologically meaningful relationships that are not straightforwardly visible from annotations, for instance, between cells in different developmental stages such as thymocytes and T-cells.

Furthermore, we prove that a maximally coherent network with constant interaction strengths will always be linearly stable. We also propose a simple model which, by correctly capturing the trophic coherence of food webs, accurately reproduces their stability and other basic structural features.

We derive analytical expressions for the substitution rate of a deleterious mutation as a function of its fitness cost, as well as the reduction in the beneficial substitution rate due to the genetic load of the passengers. We find that the fate of each deleterious mutation varies dramatically with the rate and spectrum of beneficial mutations, with a non-monotonic dependence on both the population size and the rate of adaptation. By quantifying this dependence, our results allow us to estimate which deleterious mutations will be likely to fix, and how many of these mutations must arise before the progress of adaptation is significantly reduced.",14,[],10

1406.1564,q-bio,"The development of reliable methods for restoring susceptibility after antibiotic resistance arises has proven elusive. A greater understanding of the relationship between antibiotic administration and the evolution of resistance is key to overcoming this challenge. Here we present a data-driven mathematical approach for developing antibiotic treatment plans that can reverse the evolution of antibiotic resistance determinants. We have generated adaptive landscapes for 16 genotypes of the TEM beta-lactamase that vary from the wild type genotype TEM-1 through all combinations of four amino acid substitutions. We determined the growth rate of each genotype when treated with each of 15 beta-lactam antibiotics. By using growth rates as a measure of fitness, we computed the probability of each amino acid substitution in each beta-lactam treatment using two different models named the Correlated Probability Model (CPM) and the Equal Probability Model (EPM). We then performed an exhaustive search through the 15 treatments for substitution paths leading from each of the 16 genotypes back to the wild type TEM-1. We identified those treatment paths that returned the highest probabilities of selecting for reversions of amino acid substitutions and returning TEM to the wild type state. For the CPM model, the optimized probabilities ranged between 0.6 and 1.0. For the EPM model, the optimized probabilities ranged between 0.38 and 1.0. For cyclical CPM treatment plans in which the starting and ending genotype was the wild type, the probabilities were between 0.62 and 0.7. Overall this study shows that there is promise for reversing the evolution of resistance through antibiotic treatment plans.",14,[],10

1407.2088,q-bio,"Fractal structure of shortest paths depends strongly on interresidue interaction cutoff distance. The dimensionality of shortest paths is calculated as a function of interaction cutoff distance. Shortest paths are self similar with a fractal dimension of 1.12 when calculated with step lengths larger than 6.8 \AA. Paths are multifractal below 6.8 \AA. The number of steps to traverse a shortest path is a discontinuous function of cutoff size at short cutoff values, showing abrupt decreases to smaller values as cutoff distance increases. As information progresses along the direction of a shortest path a large set of residues are affected because they are interacting neighbors to the residues of the shortest path. Thus, several residues are involved diffusively in information transport which may be identified with the present model. An algorithm is introduced to determine the residues of a given shortest path. The shortest path residues are the highly visited residues during information transport. These paths are shown to lie on the high entropy landscape of the protein where entropy is taken to increase with abundance of visits to nodes during signal transport.",14,['physics'],10

We present a simple approach for estimating the dynamics of the calcium indicator as well as the observation noise statistics from the observed data. These parameters are then used to set up the matrix factorization problem in a constrained form that requires no further parameter tuning.

1411.4321,q-bio,"The mean size of exponentially dividing E. coli cells cultured in different nutrient conditions is known to depend on the mean growth rate only. However, the joint fluctuations relating cell size, doubling time and individual growth rate are only starting to be characterized. Recent studies in bacteria (i) revealed the near constancy of the size extension in a single cell cycle (adder mechanism), and (ii) reported a universal trend where the spread in both size and doubling times is a linear function of the population means of these variables. Here, we combine experiments and theory and use scaling concepts to elucidate the constraints posed by the second observation on the division control mechanism and on the joint fluctuations of sizes and doubling times. We found that scaling relations based on the means both collapse size and doubling-time distributions across different conditions, and explain how the shape of their joint fluctuations deviates from the means. Our data on these joint fluctuations highlight the importance of cell individuality: single cells do not follow the dependence observed for the means between size and either growth rate or inverse doubling time. Our calculations show that these results emerge from a broad class of division control mechanisms (including the adder mechanism as a particular case) requiring a certain scaling form of the so-called ""division hazard rate function"", which defines the probability rate of dividing as a function of measurable parameters. This gives a rationale for the universal body-size distributions observed in microbial ecosystems across many microbial species, presumably dividing with multiple mechanisms.

1407.5328,q-bio,"The physics of the environment provide a rich spatiotemporal structure for our experience. Objects move in predictable ways and their features and identity remain stable across time and space. How does the brain leverage this structure to make predictions about and learn from the environment? This thesis describes research centered around a mechanistic description of sensory prediction called LeabraTI (TI: Temporal Integration) that explains precisely how predictive processing is accomplished in neocortical microcircuits. The fundamental prediction of LeabraTI is that predictions and sensations are interleaved across the same neural tissue at an overall rate of 10 Hz, corresponding to the widely studied alpha rhythm of posterior cortex. Experiments described herein tested this prediction by manipulating the spatiotemporal properties of three-dimensional object stimuli in a laboratory setting. EEG results indicated that predictions were subserved by ~10 Hz oscillations that reliably tracked the onset of stimuli and differentiated between spatially predictable and unpredictable object sequences. There was a behavioral advantage for combined spatial and temporal predictability for discrimination of unlearned objects, but prolonged study of objects under this combined predictability context impaired discriminability relative to other learning contexts. This counterintuitive pattern of results was accounted for by a neural network model that learned three-dimensional viewpoint invariance with LeabraTI's spatiotemporal prediction rule. Synaptic weight scaling from prolonged learning built viewpoint invariance, but led to confusion between ambiguous views of objects, producing slightly lower performance on average. Overall, this work advances a biological architecture for sensory prediction accompanied by empirical evidence that supports learning of realistic time- and space-varying inputs.",14,[],10

1410.7642,q-bio,"Bistability is ubiquitous in biological systems. For example, bistability is found in many reaction networks that involve the control and execution of important biological functions, such as signalling processes. Positive feedback loops, composed of species and reactions, are necessary for bistability, and generally for multi-stationarity, to occur. These loops are therefore often used to illustrate and pinpoint the parts of a multi-stationary network that are relevant (`responsible') for the observed multi-stationarity. However positive feedback loops are generally abundant in reaction networks but not all of them are important for subsequent interpretation of the network's dynamics.   We present an automated procedure to determine the relevant positive feedback loops of a multi-stationary reaction network. The procedure only reports the loops that are relevant for multi-stationarity (that is, when broken multi-stationarity disappears) and not all positive feedback loops of the network. We show that the relevant positive feedback loops must be understood in the context of the network (one loop might be relevant for one network, but cannot create multi-stationarity in another). Finally, we demonstrate the procedure by applying it to several examples of signaling processes, including a ubiquitination and an apoptosis network, and to models extracted from the Biomodels database.   We have developed and implemented an automated procedure to find relevant positive feedback loops in reaction networks. The results of the procedure are useful for interpretation and summary of the network's dynamics.",14,[],10

This suggests that the brain has evolved mechanisms to stabilize dynamics and maintain them across a range of situations. Here, we employ a local homeostatic inhibitory plasticity mechanism, balancing inhibitory and excitatory activity in a model of macroscopic brain activity based on white-matter structural connectivity. We demonstrate that the addition of homeostatic plasticity regulates network activity and allows for the emergence of rich, spontaneous dynamics across a range of brain configurations.

It is thought that this delay is mediated by regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and that a gradual loss of effectiveness in this population leads to T1D. However, this does not explain why some mice progress and others do not. We propose a simple mathematical model of the interaction between beta cells and the immune populations, including regulatory T-cells. We find that individual mice may enter one of two stable steady states: a `mild' insulitis state that does not progress to T1D and a `severe' insulitis state that does. We then run a sensitivity analysis to identify which parameters affect incidence of T1D versus those that affect age of onset. We also test the model by simulating several experimental manipulations found in the literature that modify insulitis severity and/or Treg activity.

Recent experiments indicate that bursting and feedback mechanisms play important roles in controlling noise in gene expression and phenotypic variation. A quantitative understanding of the impact of these factors requires analysis of the corresponding stochastic models. However, for stochastic models of gene expression with feedback and bursting, exact analytical results for protein distributions have not been obtained so far. Here, we analyze a model of gene expression with bursting and feedback regulation and obtain exact results for the corresponding protein steady-state distribution. The results obtained provide new insights into the role of bursting and feedback in noise regulation and optimization. Furthermore, for a specific choice of parameters, the system studied maps on to a two-state biochemical switch driven by a bursty input noise source. The analytical results derived thus provide quantitative insights into diverse cellular processes involving noise in gene expression and biochemical switching.",14,"['cond-mat', 'physics']",10
1401.5893,q-bio,"We present a stochastic formalism for signal transduction processes in bacterial two-component system. Using elementary mass action kinetics, the proposed model takes care of signal transduction in terms of phosphotransfer mechanism between the cognate partners of a two-component system, viz, the sensor kinase and the response regulator. Based on the difference in functionality of the sensor kinase, the noisy phosphotransfer mechanism has been studied for monofunctional and bifunctional two component system using the formalism of linear noise approximation. Steady state analysis of both models quantifies different physically realizable quantities, e.g., variance, coefficient of variation, mutual information. The resultant data reveals that both systems reliably transfer information of extra-cellular environment under low external stimulus and at high kinase and phosphatase regime.

We develop the thermodynamics of the ensemble and establish a rigorous mapping to thermodynamics.

1412.1243,q-bio,"The rapid development of sequencing technologies represents new opportunities for population genetics research. It is expected that genomic data will increase our ability to reconstruct the history of populations. While this increase in genetic information will likely help biologists and anthropologists to reconstruct the demographic history of populations, it also represents new challenges. Recent work has shown that structured populations generate signals of population size change. As a consequence it is often difficult to determine whether demographic events such as expansions or contractions (bottlenecks) inferred from genetic data are real or due to the fact that populations are structured in nature. Given that few inferential methods allow us to account for that structure, and that genomic data will necessarily increase the precision of parameter estimates, it is important to develop new approaches. In the present study we analyse two demographic models. The first is a model of instantaneous population size change whereas the second is the classical symmetric island model. We (i) re-derive the distribution of coalescence times under the two models for a sample of size two, (ii) use a maximum likelihood approach to estimate the parameters of these models (iii) validate this estimation procedure under a wide array of parameter combinations, (iv) implement and validate a model choice procedure by using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

1404.3655,q-bio,"Inter-individual differences in many behaviors are partly due to genetic differences, but the identification of the genes and variants that influence behavior remains challenging. Here, we studied an F2 intercross of two outbred lines of rats selected for tame and aggressive behavior towards humans for more than 64 generations. By using a mapping approach that is able to identify genetic loci segregating within the lines, we identified four times more loci influencing tameness and aggression than by an approach that assumes fixation of causative alleles, suggesting that many causative loci were not driven to fixation by the selection. We used RNA sequencing in 150 F2 animals to identify hundreds of loci that influence brain gene expression. Several of these loci colocalize with tameness loci and may reflect the same genetic variants. Through analyses of correlations between allele effects on behavior and gene expression, differential expression between the tame and aggressive rat selection lines, and correlations between gene expression and tameness in F2 animals, we identify the genes Gltscr2, Lgi4, Zfp40 and Slc17a7 as candidate contributors to the strikingly different behavior of the tame and aggressive animals.",14,[],10
1411.0905,q-bio,"High-throughput molecular screening is required to investigate the origin and diffusion of antimicrobial resistance in pathogen outbreaks. The most frequent cause of human infection is Escherichia coli, which is dominated by sequence type 131 (ST131), a set of rapidly radiating pandemic clones. The highly infectious clades of ST131 originated firstly by a mutation enhancing virulence and adhesion. Secondly, single-nucleotide polymorphisms occurred enabling fluoroquinolone-resistance, which is near-fixed in all ST131. Thirdly, broader resistance through beta-lactamases has been gained and lost frequently, symptomatic of conflicting environmental selective effects. This flexible approach to gene exchange is worrying and supports the proposition that ST131 will develop an even wider range of plasmid and chromosomal elements promoting antimicrobial resistance. To stymie ST131, deep genome sequencing is required to understand the origin, evolution and spread of antimicrobial resistance genes. Phylogenetic methods that decipher past events can predict future patterns of virulence and transmission based on genetic signatures of adaptation and gene exchange. Both the effect of partial antimicrobial exposure and cell dormancy caused by variation in gene expression may accelerate the development of resistance. High-throughput sequencing can decode measurable evolution of cell populations within patients associated with systems-wide changes in gene expression during treatments. A multi-faceted approach can enhance assessment of antimicrobial resistance in E. coli ST131 by examining transmission dynamics between hosts to achieve a goal of pre-empting resistance before it emerges by optimising antimicrobial treatment protocols.",14,[],10

1411.3507,q-bio,"The olfactory system of male moths is exquisitely sensitive to pheromones emitted by females and transported in the environment by atmospheric turbulence. Moths respond to minute amounts of pheromones and their behavior is sensitive to the fine-scale structure of turbulent plumes where pheromone concentration is detectible. The signal of pheromone whiffs is qualitatively known to be intermittent, yet quantitative characterization of its statistical properties is lacking. This challenging fluid dynamics problem is also relevant for entomology, neurobiology and the technological design of olfactory stimulators aimed at reproducing physiological odor signals in well-controlled laboratory conditions. Here, we develop a Lagrangian approach to the transport of pheromones by turbulent flows and exploit it to predict the statistics of odor detection during olfactory searches. The theory yields explicit probability distributions for the intensity and the duration of pheromone detections, as well as their spacing in time. Predictions are favorably tested by using numerical simulations, laboratory experiments and field data for the atmospheric surface layer. The resulting signal of odor detections lends to implementation with state-of-the-art technologies and quantifies the amount and the type of information that male moths can exploit during olfactory searches.",14,['physics'],10
1402.5062,q-bio,"In many key applications of metabolomics, such as toxicology or nutrigenomics, it is of interest to profile and detect changes in metabolic processes, usually represented in the form of pathways. As an alternative, a broader point of view would enable investigators to better understand the relations between entities that exist in different processes. Therefore, relating a possible perturbation to several known processes represents a new approach to this field of study. We propose to use a network representation of metabolism in terms of reactants, enzyme and metabolite. To model these systems it is possible to describe both reactions and relations among enzymes and metabolites. In this way, analysis of the impact of changes in some metabolites or enzymes on different processes are easier to understand, detect and predict. Results: We release the MetaboX library, an open source PHP framework for developing metabolic networks from a set of compounds. This library uses data stored in Kyoto Encyclopedia for Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database using its RESTful Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and methods to enhance manipulation of the information returned from KEGG webservice. The MetaboX library includes methods to extract information about a resource of interest (e.g. metabolite, reaction and enzyme) and to build reactants networks, bipartite enzyme-metabolite and unipartite enzyme networks. These networks can be exported in different formats for data visualization with standard tools.

Higher abstraction levels based on a macro-state decomposition of the landscape enable the study of larger systems, however they are still restricted by huge memory requirements of exact approaches.   We present a highly parallelizable local enumeration scheme that enables the computation of exact macro-state transition models with highly reduced memory requirements. The approach is evaluated on RNA secondary structure landscapes using a gradient basin definition for macro-states.

In this paper we determine, starting from the deterministic mean-field rate equations, for large classes of systems the space of coexistence fixed points at which biodiversity is maximal.

1404.0394,q-bio,The multiple futile cycle is an important building block in networks of chemical reactions arising in molecular biology. A typical process which it describes is the addition of n phosphate groups to a protein. It can be modelled by a system of ordinary differential equations depending on parameters. The special case n = 2 is called the dual futile cycle. The main result of this paper is a proof that there are parameter values for which the system of ODE describing the dual futile cycle has two distinct stable stationary solutions. The proof is based on bifurcation theory and geometric singular perturbation theory. An important entity built of three coupled multiple futile cycles is the MAPK cascade. It is explained how the ideas used to prove bistability for the dual futile cycle might help to prove the existence of periodic solutions for the MAPK cascade.,14,['math'],10
1410.5610,q-bio,"In this paper, we present data for the lognormal distributions of spike rates, synaptic weights and intrinsic excitability (gain) for neurons in various brain areas, such as auditory or visual cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, striatum, midbrain nuclei. We find a remarkable consistency of heavy-tailed, specifically lognormal, distributions for rates, weights and gains in all brain areas examined. The difference between strongly recurrent and feed-forward connectivity (cortex vs. striatum and cerebellum), neurotransmitter (GABA (striatum) or glutamate (cortex)) or the level of activation (low in cortex, high in Purkinje cells and midbrain nuclei) turns out to be irrelevant for this feature. Logarithmic scale distribution of weights and gains appears to be a general, functional property in all cases analyzed. We then created a generic neural model to investigate adaptive learning rules that create and maintain lognormal distributions. We conclusively demonstrate that not only weights, but also intrinsic gains, need to have strong Hebbian learning in order to produce and maintain the experimentally attested distributions. This provides a solution to the long-standing question about the type of plasticity exhibited by intrinsic excitability.",14,['cs'],10
1407.4374,q-bio,"Target identification, one of the steps of drug discovery, aims at identifying biomolecules whose function should be therapeutically altered in order to cure the considered pathology. This work proposes an algorithm for in silico target identification using Boolean network attractors. It assumes that attractors of dynamical systems, such as Boolean networks, correspond to phenotypes produced by the modeled biological system. Under this assumption, and given a Boolean network modeling a pathophysiology, the algorithm identifies target combinations able to remove attractors associated with pathological phenotypes. It is tested on a Boolean model of the mammalian cell cycle bearing a constitutive inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein, as seen in cancers, and its applications are illustrated on a Boolean model of Fanconi anemia. The results show that the algorithm returns target combinations able to remove attractors associated with pathological phenotypes and then succeeds in performing the proposed in silico target identification. However, as with any in silico evidence, there is a bridge to cross between theory and practice, thus requiring it to be used in combination with wet lab experiments. Nevertheless, it is expected that the algorithm is of interest for target identification, notably by exploiting the inexpensiveness and predictive power of computational approaches to optimize the efficiency of costly wet lab experiments.",14,[],10
1403.4196,q-bio,"Massive research efforts are now underway to develop a cure for HIV infection, allowing patients to discontinue lifelong combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). New latency-reversing agents (LRAs) may be able to purge the persistent reservoir of latent virus in resting memory CD4 T cells, but the degree of reservoir reduction needed for cure remains unknown. Here we use a stochastic model of infection dynamics to estimate the efficacy of LRA needed to prevent viral rebound after ART interruption. We incorporate clinical data to estimate population-level parameter distributions and outcomes. Our findings suggest that approximately 2,000-fold reductions are required to permit a majority of patients to interrupt ART for one year without rebound and that rebound may occur suddenly after multiple years. Greater than 10,000-fold reductions may be required to prevent rebound altogether. Our results predict large variation in rebound times following LRA therapy, which will complicate clinical management. This model provides benchmarks for moving LRAs from the lab to the clinic and can aid in the design and interpretation of clinical trials. These results also apply to other interventions to reduce the latent reservoir and can explain the observed return of viremia after months of apparent cure in recent bone marrow transplant recipients and an immediately-treated neonate.",14,[],10

These species are virtually in all real-world networks, they are typically short-lived, degraded at a fast rate and hard to observe experimentally.   We provide conditions under which the Markov process of a multiscale reaction network with intermediate species is approximated in finite dimensional distribution by the Markov process of a simpler reduced reaction network without intermediate species.

1406.6557,q-bio,"Synthetic lethal reaction/gene-sets are sets of reactions/genes where only the simultaneous removal of all reactions/genes in the set abolishes growth of an organism. In silico, synthetic lethal sets can be identified by simulating the effect of removal of gene sets from the reconstructed genome-scale metabolic network of an organism. Flux balance analysis (FBA), based on linear programming, has emerged as a powerful tool for the in silico analyses of metabolic networks. To identify all possible synthetic lethal reactions combinations, an exhaustive sampling of all possible combinations is computationally expensive. We surmount the computational complexity of exhaustive search by iteratively restricting the sample space of reaction combinations for search, resulting in a substantial reduction in the running time. We here propose an algorithm, Fast-SL, which provides an efficient way to analyse metabolic networks for higher order lethal reaction sets. Fast-SL offers a substantial speed-up through a massive reduction in the search space for synthetic lethals; in the case of E. coli, Fast-SL reduces the search space for synthetic lethal triplets by over 4000-fold. Fast-SL also compares favourably with SL Finder, an algorithm for identifying synthetic lethal sets, by Suthers et al (2009), which involves the solution of a bi-level Mixed Integer Linear Programming problem.

1411.6285,q-bio,"According to Cobanoglu et al and Murphy, it is now widely acknowledged that the single target paradigm (one protein or target, one disease, one drug) that has been the dominant premise in drug development in the recent past is untenable. More often than not, a drug-like compound (ligand) can be promiscuous - that is, it can interact with more than one target protein. In recent years, in in silico target prediction methods the promiscuity issue has been approached computationally in different ways. In this study we confine attention to the so-called ligand-based target prediction machine learning approaches, commonly referred to as target-fishing. With a few exceptions, the target-fishing approaches that are currently ubiquitous in cheminformatics literature can be essentially viewed as single-label multi-classification schemes; these approaches inherently bank on the single target paradigm assumption that a ligand can home in on one specific target. In order to address the ligand promiscuity issue, one might be able to cast target-fishing as a multi-label multi-class classification problem. For illustrative and comparison purposes, single-label and multi-label Naive Bayes classification models (denoted here by SMM and MMM, respectively) for target-fishing were implemented. The models were constructed and tested on 65,587 compounds and 308 targets retrieved from the ChEMBL17 database. SMM and MMM performed differently: for 16,344 test compounds, the MMM model returned recall and precision values of 0.8058 and 0.6622, respectively; the corresponding recall and precision values yielded by the SMM model were 0.7805 and 0.7596, respectively.

1403.1552,q-bio,"Secondary contact between divergent populations or incipient species may result in the exchange and introgression of genomic material. We develop a simple DNA sequence measure, called Gmin, which is designed to identify genomic regions experiencing introgression in a secondary contact model. Gmin is defined as the ratio of the minimum between-population number of nucleotide differences to the average number of between-population differences. One advantage of Gmin is that it is computationally inexpensive relative to model-based methods for detecting gene flow and it scales easily to the level of whole-genome analysis. We compare the sensitivity and specificity of Gmin to those of the widely used index of population differentiation, Fst, and suggest a simple statistical test for identifying genomic outliers. Extensive computer simulations demonstrate that Gmin has both greater sensitivity and specificity for detecting recent introgression than does Fst. Furthermore, we find that the sensitivity of Gmin is robust with respect to both the population mutation and recombination rates. Finally, a scan of Gmin across the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster identifies candidate regions of introgression between sub-Saharan African and cosmopolitan populations that were previously missed by other methods. These results show that Gmin is a biologically straightforward, yet powerful, alternative to Fst, as well as to more computationally intensive model-based methods for detecting gene flow.",14,[],10

We analyze a population genetics model that incorporates purifying selection, reversible mutations and genetic drift, assuming a stationary population size. We derive analytical results for both population parameters and sample statistics, and discuss their implications for studies of natural genetic and epigenetic variation. In particular, we find that (1) many more intermediate frequency variants are expected than under standard models, even with moderately strong purifying selection (2) rates of evolution under purifying selection may be close to, or even exceed, neutral rates.

1405.5944,q-bio,"Background: Previous studies have used different methods in an effort to extract the modular organization of transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs). However, these approaches are not natural, as they try to cluster highly connected genes into a module or locate known pleiotropic transcription factors in lower hierarchical layers. Here, we unravel the TRN of Escherichia coli by separating it into its key elements, thus revealing its natural organization. We also present a mathematical criterion, based on the topological features of the TRN, to classify the network elements into one of two possible classes: hierarchical or modular genes.   Results: We found that modular genes are clustered into physiologically correlated groups validated by a statistical analysis of the enrichment of the functional classes. Hierarchical genes encode transcription factors responsible for coordinating module responses based on general interest signals. Hierarchical elements correlate highly with the previously studied global regulators, suggesting that this could be the first mathematical method to identify global regulators. We identified a new element in TRNs never described before: intermodular genes. These are structural genes that integrate, at the promoter level, signals coming from different modules, and therefore from different physiological responses. Using the concept of pleiotropy, we have reconstructed the hierarchy of the network and discuss the role of feedforward motifs in shaping the hierarchical backbone of the TRN.   Conclusions: This study sheds new light on the design principles underpinning the organization of TRNs, showing a novel nonpyramidal architecture composed of independent modules globally governed by hierarchical transcription factors, whose responses are integrated by intermodular genes.",14,[],10

1410.8499,q-bio,"Random mixing in host populations has been a convenient simplifying assumption in the study of epidemics, but neglects important differences in contact rates within and between population groups. For HIV/AIDS, the assumption of random mixing is inappropriate for epidemics that are concentrated in groups of people at high risk, including female sex workers (FSW) and their male clients (MCF), injection drug users (IDU) and men who have sex with men (MSM). To find out who transmits infection to whom and how that affects the spread and containment of infection remains a major empirical challenge in the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS. Here we develop a technique, based on the routine sampling of infection in linked population groups, which shows how an Asian HIV/AIDS epidemic began in FSW, was propagated mainly by IDU, and ultimately generated most cases among the female partners of MCF (FPM). Calculation of the case reproduction numbers within and between groups, and for the whole network, provides insights into control that cannot be deduced simply from observations on the prevalence of infection. Specifically, the per capita rate of HIV transmission was highest from FSW to MCF, and most HIV infections occurred in FPM, but the number of infections in the whole network is best reduced by interrupting transmission to and from IDU. This network analysis can be used to guide HIV/AIDS interventions based on needle exchange, condom distribution and antiretroviral therapy. The method requires only routine data and could be applied to infections in other populations.",14,['stat'],10

We used eight different synthetic and natural CS samples with a range of molecular weights (7-35 kDa) and sulfation patterns. Our studies indicate that the absorption of CS is moderately correlated to percentage of chondroitin-6-sulfate while the anti-inflammatory activity may be weakly related to the molecular weight and the amount of total sulfation in the samples. Our in vitro studies could provide helpful screening tools for quick and effective evaluation of CS samples as a preliminary step towards in vivo studies.",14,['physics'],10
1405.0233,q-bio,"Mean field (MF) approximation offers a simple, fast way to infer direct interactions between elements in a network of correlated variables, a common, computationally challenging problem with practical applications in fields ranging from physics and biology to the social sciences. However, MF methods achieve their best performance with strong regularization, well beyond Bayesian expectations, an empirical fact that is poorly understood. In this work, we study the influence of pseudo-count and equation-norm regularization schemes on the quality of inferred Ising or Potts interaction networks from correlation data within the MF approximation. We argue, based on the analysis of small systems, that the optimal value of the regularization strength remains finite even if the sampling noise tends to zero, in order to correct for systematic biases introduced by the MF approximation. Our claim is corroborated by extensive numerical studies of diverse model systems and by the analytical study of the equation-component spin model, for large but finite equation. Additionally we find that pseudo-count regularization is robust against sampling noise, and often outperforms equation-norm regularization, particularly when the underlying network of interactions is strongly heterogeneous. Much better performances are generally obtained for the Ising model than for the Potts model, for which only couplings incoming onto medium-frequency symbols are reliably inferred.",14,['cond-mat'],10
1402.0042,q-bio,"Next-generation sequencing technology enables the identification of thousands of gene regulatory sequences in many cell types and organisms. We consider the problem of testing if two such sequences differ in their number of binding site motifs for a given transcription factor (TF) protein. Binding site motifs impart regulatory function by providing TFs the opportunity to bind to genomic elements and thereby affect the expression of nearby genes. Evolutionary changes to such functional DNA are hypothesized to be major contributors to phenotypic diversity within and between species; but despite the importance of TF motifs for gene expression, no method exists to test for motif loss or gain. Assuming that motif counts are Binomially distributed, and allowing for dependencies between motif instances in evolutionarily related sequences, we derive the probability mass function of the difference in motif counts between two nucleotide sequences. We provide a method to numerically estimate this distribution from genomic data and show through simulations that our estimator is accurate. Finally, we introduce the R package \tt motifDiverge that implements our methodology and illustrate its application to gene regulatory enhancers identified by a mouse developmental time course experiment. While this study was motivated by analysis of regulatory motifs, our results can be applied to any problem involving two correlated Bernoulli trials.",14,[],10
1401.2749,q-bio,"Cells often exhibit different and stable phenotypes from the same DNA sequence. Robustness and plasticity of such cellular states are controlled by diverse transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms, among them the modification of biochemical marks on chromatin. Here, we develop a stochastic model that describes the dynamics of epigenetic marks along a given DNA region. Through mathematical analysis, we show the emergence of bistable and persistent epigenetic states from the cooperative recruitment of modifying enzymes. We also find that the dynamical system exhibits a critical point and displays, in presence of asymmetries in recruitment, a bifurcation diagram with hysteresis. These results have deep implications for our understanding of epigenetic regulation. In particular, our study allows to reconcile within the same formalism the robust maintenance of epigenetic identity observed in differentiated cells, the epigenetic plasticity of pluripotent cells during differentiation and the effects of epigenetic misregulation in diseases. Moreover, it suggests a possible mechanism for developmental transitions where the system is shifted close to the critical point to benefit from high susceptibility to developmental cues.",14,[],10
1403.6328,q-bio,"Movement is a fundamental behaviour of organisms that brings about beneficial encounters with resources and mates, but at the same time exposes the organism to dangerous encounters with predators. The movement patterns adopted by organisms should reflect a balance between these contrasting processes. This trade-off can be hypothesized as being evident in the behaviour of plankton, which inhabit a dilute 3D environment with few refuges or orienting landmarks. We present an analysis of the swimming path geometries based on a volumetric Monte Carlo sampling approach, which is particularly adept at revealing such trade-offs by measuring the self-overlap of the trajectories. Application of this method to experimentally measured trajectories reveals that swimming patterns in copepods are shaped to efficiently explore volumes at small scales, while achieving a large overlap at larger scales. Regularities in the observed trajectories make the transition between these two regimes always sharper than in randomized trajectories or as predicted by random walk theory. Thus real trajectories present a stronger separation between exploration for food and exposure to predators. The specific scale and features of this transition depend on species, gender, and local environmental conditions, pointing at adaptation to state and stage dependent evolutionary trade-offs.",14,[],10

We find that assembly pathways can be categorized into two classes, in which intermediates are either predominantly ordered or disordered. Our results suggest that estimating the protein-protein and the protein-genome binding affinities may be sufficient to predict which pathway occurs. Furthermore, the calculated phase diagrams suggest that knowledge of the dominant assembly pathway and its relationship to control parameters could identify optimal strategies to thwart or redirect assembly to block infection.

1412.0968,q-bio,"As an emergent infectious disease outbreak unfolds, public health response is reliant on information on key epidemiological quantities, such as transmission potential and serial interval. Increasingly, transmission models fit to incidence data are used to estimate these parameters and guide policy. Some widely-used modeling practices lead to potentially large errors in parameter estimates and, consequently, errors in model-based forecasts. Even more worryingly, in such situations, confidence in parameter estimates and forecasts can itself be far over-estimated, leading to the potential for large errors that mask their own presence. Fortunately, straightforward and computationally inexpensive alternatives exist that avoid these problems. Here, we first use a simulation study to demonstrate potential pitfalls of the standard practice of fitting deterministic models to cumulative incidence data. Next, we demonstrate an alternative based on stochastic models fit to raw data from an early phase of 2014 West Africa Ebola Virus Disease outbreak. We show not only that bias is thereby reduced, but that uncertainty in estimates and forecasts is better quantified and that, critically, lack of model fit is more readily diagnosed.

1406.2130,quant-ph,"We consider the information flow on a system's observable equation corresponding to a positive-operator valued measure under a quantum measurement process equation described by a completely positive instrument from the viewpoint of the relative entropy. We establish a sufficient condition for the relative-entropy conservation law which states that the averaged decrease in the relative entropy of the system's observable equation equals the relative entropy of the measurement outcome of equation, i.e. the information gain due to measurement. This sufficient condition is interpreted as an assumption of classicality in the sense that there exists a sufficient statistic in a joint successive measurement of equation followed by equation such that the probability distribution of the statistic coincides with that of a single measurement of equation for the pre-measurement state. We show that in the case when equation is a discrete projection-valued measure and equation is discrete, the classicality condition is equivalent to the relative-entropy conservation for arbitrary states. The general theory on the relative-entropy conservation is applied to typical quantum measurement models, namely quantum non-demolition measurement, destructive sharp measurements on two-level systems, a photon counting, a quantum counting, homodyne and heterodyne measurements. These examples except for the non-demolition and photon-counting measurements do not satisfy the known Shannon-entropy conservation law proposed by Ban~(M. Ban, J. Phys. A: Math.

1409.3898,quant-ph,"We study restrictions on locality-preserving unitary logical gates for topological quantum codes in two spatial dimensions. A locality-preserving operation is one which maps local operators to local operators --- for example, a constant-depth quantum circuit of geometrically local gates, or evolution for a constant time governed by a geometrically-local bounded-strength Hamiltonian. Locality-preserving logical gates of topological codes are intrinsically fault tolerant because spatially localized errors remain localized, and hence sufficiently dilute errors remain correctable. By invoking general properties of two-dimensional topological field theories, we find that the locality-preserving logical gates are severely limited for codes which admit non-abelian anyons; in particular, there are no locality-preserving logical gates on the torus or the sphere with M punctures if the braiding of anyons is computationally universal. Furthermore, for Ising anyons on the M-punctured sphere, locality-preserving gates must be elements of the logical Pauli group. We derive these results by relating logical gates of a topological code to automorphisms of the Verlinde algebra of the corresponding anyon model, and by requiring the logical gates to be compatible with basis changes in the logical Hilbert space arising from local F-moves and the mapping class group.",14,['cond-mat'],6

Our interference experiments comparing the optimization method with the traditional phase shifting method show that when the same photon resources are used, the optimization method provides phase recoveries with tighter error bars. In particular, RMS phase error performance of the optimization method for low photon number data (10 photons per pixel) shows equation 5X noise gain over the phase shifting method. In our experiments where a laser light source is used for illumination, the results imply phase measurement with accuracy better than the conventional single pixel based shot noise limit (SNL) that assumes independent phases at individual pixels.

1410.0955,quant-ph,"A sufficient condition for a quantum state of a system of spin-1/2 particles (spin-1/2s) to admit a local hidden variable (LHV) description i.e. to be classical is the separability of the density matrix characterizing its state, but not all classical states are separable. This leads one to infer that separability and classicality are two different concepts. These concepts are examined here in the framework of a criterion for identifying classicality of a system of spin-1/2s based on the concept of joint quasiprobability (JQP) for the eigevalues of spin components. The said criterion identifies a state as classical if a suitably defined JQP of the eigenvalues of spin components in suitably chosen three or two orthogonal directions is non-negative. In agreement with other approaches, the JQP based criterion leads to the result that all non-factorizable pure states of two spin-1/2s are non-classical. Furthermore, the validity of the criterion is confirmed by comparing its predictions with those arrived at by other methods when applied to several mixed states of two spin-1/2s and the Werner like state of three spin-1/2s (G.Toth and A.Acin,Phys.Rev.

The theory of quantum entanglement is currently leading to a paradigm shift in understanding quantum correlations in many body systems and in this work we show how symmetry breaking can be understood from this wavefunction centered point of view. We demonstrate that the existence of symmetry breaking is a consequence of the geometric structure of the convex set of reduced density matrices of all possible many body wavefunctions. The surfaces of those convex bodies exhibit non-analytic behavior in the form of ruled surfaces, which turn out to be the defining signatures for the emergence of symmetry breaking and of an associated order parameter.   We illustrate this by plotting the convex sets arising in the context of three paradigmatic examples of many body systems exhibiting symmetry breaking: the quantum Ising model in transverse magnetic field, exhibiting a second order quantum phase transition; the classical Ising model at finite temperature in two dimensions, which orders below a critical temperature equation; and a system of free bosons at finite temperature in three dimensions, exhibiting the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation together with an associated order parameter equation.

We revisit these relations for classical variables by using the Frechet differentiation with respect to covariance matrices, and then show that Price's theorem carries over to a quantum mechanical setting. The quantum counterpart of the theorem is established for Gaussian quantum states in the framework of the Weyl functional calculus for quantum variables satisfying the Heisenberg canonical commutation relations. The quantum mechanical version of Price's theorem relates the Frechet derivative of the generalized moment of such variables with respect to the real part of their quantum covariance matrix with other moments.

We investigate the effect of dissipation and dephasing on the Majorana modes of a fermionic chain. The dissipative and dephasing noises induce the non-parity- and parity-preserving transitions between the eigenstates of the system, respectively. Therefore, these two types of noises lead to the different decoherence mechanisms. In each type of noise, we discuss the low- and high-frequency regimes to describe the different environments. We numerically calculate the dissipation and dephasing rates in the presence of long-range interactions.

We compare our results with those obtained by using the traditional relative entropies. We find that the measures satisfy all the plausible axioms for quantum correlations. We evaluate the measures for shared pure as well as paradigmatic classes of mixed states. We show that the measures can faithfully detect the quantum critical point in the transverse quantum Ising model and find that they can be used to remove an unquieting feature of nearest-neighbor quantum discord in this respect.

These properties uniquely characterize generalized SICs among minimal IC measurements although, on the face of it, they bear little resemblance to the original definition. In particular, we show that in quantum state tomography generalized SICs are optimal among minimal IC measurements with given average purity of measurement outcomes. Besides its significance to the current study, this result may help understand tomographic efficiencies of minimal IC measurements under the influence of noise.

1402.3075,quant-ph,"We ask and answer a basic question about the length scales involved in quantum decoherence: how far apart in space do two parts of a quantum system have to be, before a common quantum environment decoheres them as if they were entirely separate? We frame this question specifically in a cold atom context. How far apart do two populations of bosons have to be, before an environment of thermal atoms of a different species (`buffer gas') responds to their two particle numbers separately? An initial guess for this length scale is the thermal coherence length of the buffer gas; we show that a standard Born-Markov treatment partially supports this guess, but predicts only inverse-square saturation of decoherence rates with distance, and not the much more abrupt Gaussian behavior of the buffer gas's first-order coherence. We confirm this Born-Markov result with a more rigorous theory, based on an exact solution of a two-scatterer scattering problem, which also extends the result beyond weak scattering. Finally, however, we show that when interactions within the buffer gas reservoir are taken into account, an abrupt saturation of the decoherence rate does occur, exponentially on the length scale of the buffer gas's mean free path.",14,['physics'],6

We find it helpful to categorise systems into three broad classes defined by mass, spatio-temporal coherence, and number of particles. The classes are not mutually exclusive and in fact the properties of some systems fit into several classes. We discuss experiments by turn, starting with interference of massive objects like macromolecules and micro-mechanical resonators, followed by self-interference of single particles in complex molecules, before examining the striking advances made with superconducting qubits.

1409.7732,quant-ph,"A common experimental strategy for demonstrating non-classical correlations is to show violation of a Bell inequality by measuring a continuously emitted stream of entangled photon pairs. The measurements involve the detection of photons by two spatially separated parties. The detection times are recorded and compared to quantify the violation. The violation critically depends on determining which detections are coincident. Because the recorded detection times have ""jitter"", coincidences cannot be inferred perfectly. In the presence of settings-dependent timing errors, this can allow a local-realistic system to show apparent violation--the so-called ""coincidence loophole"". Here we introduce a family of Bell inequalities based on signed, directed distances between the parties' sequences of recorded timetags. Given that the timetags are recorded for synchronized, fixed observation periods and that the settings choices are random and independent of the source, violation of these inequalities unambiguously shows non-classical correlations violating local realism. Distance-based Bell inequalities are generally useful for two-party configurations where the effective size of the measurement outcome space is large or infinite. We show how to systematically modify the underlying Bell functions to improve the signal to noise ratio and to quantify the significance of the violation.",14,[],6
1406.1014,quant-ph,"Quantum theory (QT), namely in terms of Schrodinger's 1926 wave functions in general requires complex numbers to be formulated. However, it soon turned out to even require some hypercomplex algebra. Incorporating Special Relativity leads to an equation (Dirac 1928) requiring pairwise anti-commuting coefficients, usually equation matrices. A unitary ring of square matrices is an associative hypercomplex algebra by definition. Since only the algebraic properties and relations of the elements matter, we replace the matrices by biquaternions. In this paper, we first consider the basics of non-relativistic and relativistic QT. Then we introduce general hypercomplex algebras and also show how a relativistic quantum equation like Dirac's one can be formulated using biquaternions. Subsequently, some algebraic preconditions for operations within hypercomplex algebras and their subalgebras will be examined. For our purpose equations akin to Schrodinger's should be able to be set up and solved. Functions of complementary variables should be Fourier transforms of each other. This should hold within a purely non-real subspace which must hence be a subalgebra. Furthermore, it is an ideal denoted by equation. It must be isomorphic to equation, hence containing an internal identity element. The bicomplex numbers will turn out to fulfil these preconditions, and therefore, the formalism of QT can be developed within its subalgebras. We also show that bicomplex numbers encourage the definition of several different kinds of conjugates. One of these treats the elements of equation like the usual conjugate treats complex numbers. This defines a quantity what we call a modulus which, in contrast to the complex absolute square, remains non-real (but may be called `pseudo-real').

1401.4534,quant-ph,"The Lorentz transformation (LT) is explained by changes occurring in the wave characteristics of matter as it changes inertial frame. This explanation is akin to that favoured by Lorentz, but informed by later insights, due primarily to de Broglie, regarding the underlying unity of matter and radiation. To show the nature of these changes, a massive particle is modelled as a standing wave in three dimensions. As the particle moves, the standing wave becomes a travelling wave having two factors. One is a carrier wave displaying the dilated frequency and contracted ellipsoidal form described by the LT, while the other (identified as the de Broglie wave) is a modulation defining the dephasing of the carrier wave (and thus the failure of simultaneity) in the direction of travel. The superluminality of the de Broglie wave is thus explained, as are several other mysterious features of the optical behaviour of matter, including the physical meaning of the Schrodinger Eqn. and the relevance to scattering processes of the de Broglie wave number.

We derive the quantum version of the so-called Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) equations such that the master equation can be decomposed in a hierarchical set of equation equations (equation). The hierarchy is broken by introducing the mean-field approximation and reducing the problem to a nonlinear single particle system. In this scenario, the Hamiltonian is nonlinear (i.e., it depends on the state of equation), although the superoperator responsible for the dissipation and decoherence of equation remains unaffected. To provide a useful tool to students: (1) we discuss the physical approximations involved, (2) we derive the analytical solution to the mean values equations of motion resulting from the Hamiltonian, (3) we solve analytically the master equation in the stationary regime, (4) we obtain and discuss the solution of the nonlinear master equation, numerically, and finally, (5) we discuss the master equation beyond the mean-field approximation and show how to introduce higher order quantum correlations that have been previously neglected.",14,['cond-mat'],6

Such mechanism is in close analogy with the Higgs mechanism where the gauge symmetry of the weak force's gauge bosons is broken by the nonzero vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field.

Our study is solely based on Markovian environments where quantum channels are without memory and each qubit is coupled to its own environment. We start with mixed GHZ, mixed W, mixture of separable states, a mixed biseparable state, as the initial states and mostly observe that the decay of quantum dissension is asymptotic in contrast to sudden death of quantum entanglement in similar environments. This is a clear indication of the fact that quantum correlation in general is more robust against the effect of noise. However, for a given class of initial mixed states we find a temporary leap in quantum dissension for a certain interval of time. More precisely, we observe the revival of quantum correlation to happen for certain time period. This signifies that the measure of quantum correlation such as quantum discord, quantum dissension, defined from the information theoretic perspective is different from the correlation defined from the entanglement-separability paradigm and can increase under the effect of the local noise. We also study the effects of these channels on the monogamy score of each of these initial states. Interestingly, we find that for certain class of states and channels, there is change from negative values to positive values of the monogamy score with classical randomness as well as with time. This gives us an important insight in obtaining states which are freely sharable (polygamous state) from the states which are not freely sharable (monogamous).

Our method requires at most equation configurations to characterize arbitrary noise acting on equation qubits.",14,[],6
1401.2924,quant-ph,"We find explicit solutions of the Heisenberg equations of motion for a quadratic Hamiltonian, describing a generic model of variable media, in the case of multi-parameter squeezed input photon configuration. The corresponding probability amplitudes and photon statistics are also derived in the Schroedinger picture in an abstract operator setting of the quantum electrodynamics (QED). Their time evolution is given in terms of solutions of certain Ermakov-type system. The unitary transformation and an extension of the squeeze/evolution operator are introduced formally.",14,[],6
1403.2233,quant-ph,New quantum entropic inequality for states of system of n > 1 qudits is obtained. The inequality has the form of quantum subadditivity condition of bipartite qudit system and coincides with this subadditivity condition for the system of two qudits. The general statement on existence of the subadditivity condition for arbitrary probability distribution and arbitrary qudit-system tomogram is formulated. The nonlinear quantum channels creating the entangled states from separable ones are discussed.,14,[],6
