1412.5662,astro-ph,"A magnetic dynamo driven by differential rotation generated when stars merge can explain strong fields in certain classes of magnetic stars, including the high field magnetic white dwarfs (HFMWDs). In their case the site of the differential rotation has been variously proposed to be within a common envelope, the massive hot outer regions of a merged degenerate core or an accretion disc formed by a tidally disrupted companion that is subsequently incorporated into a degenerate core. We synthesize a population of binary systems to investigate the stellar merging hypothesis for observed single HFMWDs. Our calculations provide mass distribution and the fractions of white dwarfs that merge during a common envelope phase or as double degenerate systems in a post common envelope phase. We vary the common envelope efficiency parameter alpha and compare with observations. We find that this hypothesis can explain both the observed incidence of magnetism and the mass distribution of HFMWDs for a wide range of alpha. In this model, the majority of the HFMWDs are of the Carbon Oxygen type and merge within a common envelope. Less than about a quarter of a per cent of HFMWDs originate from double degenerate stars that merge after common envelope evolution and these populate the high-mass tail of the HFMWD mass distribution.",14,[],1
1409.2487,astro-ph,"Giant molecular clouds contain supersonic turbulence and magnetohydrodynamic simulations predict that this turbulence should decay rapidly. Such turbulent dissipation has the potential to create a warm (T ~100 K) gas component within a molecular cloud. We present observations of the CO J = 5-4 and 6-5 transitions, taken with the Herschel Space Observatory, towards the Perseus B1-East 5 region. We combine these new observations with archival measurements of lower rotational transitions and fit photodissociation region models to the data. We show that Perseus B1-E5 has an anomalously large CO J = 6-5 integrated intensity, consistent with a warm gas component existing within the region. This excess emission is consistent with predictions for shock heating due to the dissipation of turbulence in low velocity shocks with the shocks having a volume filling factor of 0.15 per cent. We find that B1-E has a turbulent energy dissipation rate of 3.5 x 10equation erg / s and a dissipation time-scale that is only a factor of 3 larger than the flow crossing time-scale.",14,[],1
1404.6576,astro-ph,"We present a kinematic analysis of three triple stellar systems belonging to two open clusters: CPD-60\deg961 and HD66137 in NGC2516, and HD315031 in NGC6530. All three systems are hierarchical triples with a close binary bound to a third body in a wider orbit, whose presence is detected through velocity variations of the close binary barycentre. Orbital parameters are derived from radial velocity curves. Absolute parameters for all stars are estimated assuming cluster membership. Some dynamical and evolutionary aspects of these systems are discussed, particularly the possible influence of Kozai cycles. The two systems of NGC2516 have similar orbital configurations with inner periods of 11.23 d and 8.70 d and outer periods of 9.79 yr and 9.24 yr. We report also radial velocity measurements of the components of the visual binary CPD-60\deg944 in NGC2516. Including results from previous works, this cluster would harbor 5 hierarchical triples. The young system HD315031 has an inner binary with a period of 1.37 d and a very eccentric (e=0.85) outer orbit with a period of 483 d. Possible dynamical evolutionary scenarios are discussed. Long-term radial velocity monitoring is highlighted as strategy for the detection of subsystems with intermediate separations, which are hard to cover with normal spectroscopic studies or visual techniques.",14,[],1
1404.6525,astro-ph,"We present J, H, CH4 short (1.578 micron), CH4 long (1.652 micron) and Ks-band images of the dust ring around the 10 Myr old star HR 4796 A obtained using the Near Infrared Coronagraphic Imager (NICI) on the Gemini-South 8.1 meter Telescope. Our images clearly show for the first time the position of the star relative to its circumstellar ring thanks to NICI's translucent focal plane occulting mask. We employ a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to constrain the offset vector between the two. The resulting probability distribution shows that the ring center is offset from the star by 16.7/-1.3 milliarcseconds along a position angle of 26/-3 degrees, along the PA of the ring, 26.47/-0.04 degrees. We find that the size of this offset is not large enough to explain the brightness asymmetry of the ring. The ring is measured to have mostly red reflectivity across the JHKs filters, which seems to indicate micron-sized grains. Just like Neptune's 3:2 and 2:1 mean-motion resonances delineate the inner and outer edges of the classical Kuiper Belt, we find that the radial extent of the HR 4796 A and Fomalhaut rings could correspond to the 3:2 and 2:1 mean-motion resonances of hypothetical planets at 54.7 AU and 97.7 AU in the two systems, respectively. A planet orbiting HR 4796 A at 54.7 AU would have to be less massive than 1.6 Mjup so as not to widen the ring too much by stirring.",14,[],1
1409.2093,astro-ph,"In this work we use stacking analysis in \emphHerschel PACS to study the accuracy of several dust-correction factors typically employed to estimate total star-formation rate (SFR) of high-redshift star-forming (SF) galaxies. We also analyze what stacking suggests about the relation between SFR and stellar mass and the redshift evolution of the specific SFR (equation). We find that the dust properties of massive SF galaxies evolve with redshift, being galaxies at equation more attenuated than at equation for a given UV continuum slope and stellar mass. As a consequence, a single IRX-equation relation can not be used to recover the total SFR of massive SF galaxies at equation. This might have implications for higher redshift studies, where a single IRX-equation relation derived for local starburst is usually assumed to be valid. However, we find that the local relation between dust attenuation and stellar mass is valid at least up to equation, although deviations are found for higher redshift galaxies where only equation galaxies are detected through stacking. This, therefore, does not rule out the possibility that the local dust-mass relation can be valid for less massive SF galaxies at equation. The SED fitting procedure with stellar population templates gives over-estimated values (about 0.3--0.5 dex in equation) of the dust-corrected SFR at all redshifts studied here. We find that the slope of the main-sequence of star formation is less steep than previously found in massive galaxies with equation, and the redshift evolution of the sSFR reported in previous works in massive is well recovered.",14,[],1
1407.7710,astro-ph,"We have measured the alignment between the orbit of HATS-3b (a recently discovered, slightly inflated Hot Jupiter) and the spin-axis of its host star. Data were obtained using the CYCLOPS2 optical-fiber bundle and its simultaneous calibration system feeding the UCLES spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. The sky-projected spin-orbit angle of equation was determined from spectroscopic measurements of Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. This is the first exoplanet discovered through the HATSouth transit survey to have its spin-orbit angle measured. Our results indicate that the orbital plane of HATS-3b is consistent with being aligned to the spin axis of its host star. The low obliquity of the HATS-3 system, which has a relatively hot mid F-type host star, agrees with the general trend observed for Hot Jupiter host stars with effective temperatures equationK to have randomly distributed spin-orbit angles.",14,[],1
1412.8429,astro-ph,"This article looks at the combined constraints from a photometric and spectroscopic survey. These surveys will measure cosmology using weak lensing (WL), galaxy clustering, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and redshift space distortions (RSD). We find, contrary to some findings in the recent literature, that overlapping surveys can give important benefits when measuring dark energy. We therefore try to clarify the status of this issue with a full forecast of two stage-IV surveys using a new approach to properly account for covariance between the different probes in the overlapping samples. The benefit of the overlapping survey can be traced back to two factors: additional observables and sample variance cancellation. Both needs to be taken into account and contribute equally when combining 3D power spectrum and 2D correlations for lensing. With an analytic example we also illustrate that for optimal constraints, one should minimize the (Pearson) correlation coefficient between cosmological and nuisance parameters and maximize the one among nuisance parameters (e.g. galaxy bias) in the two samples. This can be achieved by increasing the overlap between the spectroscopic and photometric surveys. We show how BAO, WL and RSD contribute to this benefit and also look at some other survey designs, such as photometric redshift errors and spectroscopic density.",14,[],1
1401.0710,astro-ph,"Images recorded with the Gemini South Adaptive Optics Imager (GSAOI) and corrected for atmospheric seeing by the Gemini Multiconjugate Adaptive Optics System (GeMS) are used to investigate the stellar contents of the young outer Galactic disk clusters Haffner 17, NGC 2401, and NGC 3105. Ages estimated from the faint end of the main sequence (MS) and the ridgeline of the pre-main sequence (PMS) on the (K, J-K) color-magnitude diagrams are consistent with published values that are based on the MS turn-off, with the GSAOI data favoring the younger end of the age range for NGC 2401 in the literature. The mass function (MF) of NGC 2401 is similar to that in the Solar neighborhood, and stars spanning a wide range of masses in this cluster have similar clustering properties on the sky. It is concluded that NGC 2401 is not evolved dynamically. In contrast, the MF of Haffner 17 differs significantly from that in the Solar neighborhood over all masses covered by these data, while the MF of NGC 3105 is deficient in objects with sub-solar masses when compared with the Solar neighborhood. Low mass objects in Haffner 17 and NGC 3105 are also more uniformly distributed on the sky than brighter, more massive, MS stars. This is consistent with both clusters having experienced significant dynamical evolution.",14,[],1
1402.6906,astro-ph,"The Gemini Multi-conjugate Adaptive Optics System - GeMS, a facility instrument mounted on the Gemini South telescope, delivers a uniform, near diffraction limited images at near infrared wavelengths (0.95 microns- 2.5 microns) over a field of view of 120 arc seconds. GeMS is the first sodium layer based multi laser guide star adaptive optics system used in astronomy. It uses five laser guide stars distributed on a 60 arc seconds square constellation to measure for atmospheric distortions and two deformable mirrors to compensate for it. In this paper, the second devoted to describe the GeMS project, we present the commissioning, overall performance and operational scheme of GeMS. Performance of each sub-system is derived from the commissioning results. The typical image quality, expressed in full with half maximum, Strehl ratios and variations over the field delivered by the system are then described. A discussion of the main contributor to performance limitation is carried-out. Finally, overheads and future system upgrades are described.",14,[],1
1411.2736,astro-ph,"Recent observations by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) of disks around young stars revealed distinct asymmetries in the dust continuum emission. In this work we want to study axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric structures, evocated by the magneto-rotational instability in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks. We combine the results of state-of-the-art numerical simulations with post-processing radiative transfer (RT) to generate synthetic maps and predictions for ALMA. We performed non-ideal global 3D MHD stratified simulations of the dead-zone outer edge using the FARGO MHD code PLUTO. The stellar and disk parameters are taken from a parameterized disk model applied for fitting high-angular resolution multi-wavelength observations of circumstellar disks. The 2D temperature and density profiles are calculated consistently from a given surface density profile and Monte-Carlo radiative transfer. The 2D Ohmic resistivity profile is calculated using a dust chemistry model. The magnetic field is a vertical net flux field. The resulting dust reemission provides the basis for the simulation of observations with ALMA. The fiducial model develops a large gap followed by a jump in surface density located at the dead-zone outer edge. The jump in density and pressure is strong enough to stop the radial drift of particles. In addition, we observe the generation of vortices by the Rossby wave instability (RWI) at the jumps location close to 60 AU. The vortices are steadily generated and destroyed at a cycle of 40 local orbits. The RT results and simulated ALMA observations predict the feasibility to observe such large scale structures appearing in magnetized disks without having a planet.",14,[],1
1409.1377,astro-ph,"Compression of the stellar winds from rapidly rotating hot stars is described by the wind compression model. However, it was also shown that rapid rotation leads to rotational distortion of the stellar surface, resulting in the appearance of non-radial forces acting against the wind compression. In this note we justify the wind compression model for moderately rotating white dwarfs and slowly rotating giants. The former could be conducive to understanding density/ionization structure of the mass outflow from symbiotic stars and novae, while the latter can represent an effective mass-transfer mode in the wide interacting binaries.",14,[],1
1401.4064,astro-ph,"We present cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) observations obtained by the SDSS-II and SNLS collaborations. The data set includes several low-redshift samples (z<0.1), all 3 seasons from the SDSS-II (0.05 < z < 0.4), and 3 years from SNLS (0.2 <z < 1) and totals \ntotc spectroscopically confirmed type Ia supernovae with high quality light curves. We have followed the methods and assumptions of the SNLS 3-year data analysis except for the following important improvements: 1) the addition of the full SDSS-II spectroscopically-confirmed SN Ia sample in both the training of the SALT2 light curve model and in the Hubble diagram analysis (\nsdssc SNe), 2) inter-calibration of the SNLS and SDSS surveys and reduced systematic uncertainties in the photometric calibration, performed blindly with respect to the cosmology analysis, and 3) a thorough investigation of systematic errors associated with the SALT2 modeling of SN Ia light-curves. We produce recalibrated SN Ia light-curves and associated distances for the SDSS-II and SNLS samples. The large SDSS-II sample provides an effective, independent, low-z anchor for the Hubble diagram and reduces the systematic error from calibration systematics in the low-z SN sample. For a flat LCDM cosmology we find Omegam=0.295-0.034 (statsys), a value consistent with the most recent CMB measurement from the Planck and WMAP experiments. Our result is 1.8sigma (statsys) different than the previously published result of SNLS 3-year data. The change is due primarily to improvements in the SNLS photometric calibration. When combined with CMB constraints, we measure a constant dark-energy equation of state parameter w=-1.018-0.057 (statsys) for a flat universe. Adding BAO distance measurements gives similar constraints: w=-1.027-0.055.",14,[],1
1407.7867,astro-ph,"We develop a new method to account for the finite lifetimes of stars and trace individual abundances within a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. At variance with previous methods, based on the storage of the (binned) past star formation history of model galaxies, our method projects the information about the metals produced by each simple stellar population (SSP) in the future. Using this approach, an accurate accounting of the timings and properties of the individual SSPs composing model galaxies is possible. We analyse the dependence of our chemical model on various ingredients, and apply it to six simulated haloes of roughly Milky Way mass and with no massive close neighbour at z=0. For all models considered, the [Fe/H] distributions of the stars in the disc component are in good agreement with Milky Way data, while for the spheroid component (whose formation we model only through mergers) these are offset low with respect to observational measurements for the Milky Way bulge. This is a consequence of narrow star formation histories, with relatively low rates of star formation. The slow recycling of gas and energy from supernovae in our chemical model has important consequences on the predicted star formation rates, which are systematically lower than the corresponding rates in the same physical model but with an instantaneous recycling approximation. The halo that resembles most our Galaxy in terms of its global properties also reproduces the observed relation between the average metallicity and luminosity of the Milky Way satellites, albeit with a slightly steeper slope.",14,[],1
1405.6109,astro-ph,"Radiative equilibrium temperatures are calculated for the troposphere of a tidally locked Super-Earth based on a simple greenhouse model, using Solar System data as a guideline. These temperatures provide in combination with a Newtonian relaxation scheme thermal forcing for a 3D atmosphere model using the dynamical core of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology global circulation model (MITgcm). Our model is of the same conceptional simplicity than the model of Held & Suarez (1994) and is thus computationally fast. Furthermore, because of the coherent, general derivation of radiative equilibrium temperatures, our model is easily adaptable for different planets and atmospheric scenarios. As a case study relevant for Super-Earths, we investigate a Gl581g-like planet with Earth-like atmosphere and irradiation and present results for two representative rotation periods of equation = 10 days and equation = 36.5 days. Our results provide proof of concept and highlight interesting dynamical features for the rotating regime 3 < equation < 100 days, which was shown by Edson et al. (2011) to be an intermediate regime between equatorial superrotation and divergence. We confirm that the equation = 10 days case is more dominated by equatorial superrotation dynamics than the equation = 36.5 days case, which shows diminishing influence of standing Rossby- Kelvin waves and increasing influence of divergence at the top of the atmosphere. We argue that this dynamical regime change relates to the increase in Rossby deformation radius, in agreement with previous studies. However, we also pay attention to other features that are not or only in partial agreement with other studies, like, e.g., the number of circulation cells and their strength, the role and extent of thermal inversion layers, and the details of heat transport",14,[],1

1404.7200,astro-ph,"We present the first extragalactic detections of several CH rotational transitions in the far-infrared (FIR) in four nearby galaxies: NGC 1068, Arp 220, M 82 and NGC 253 using the \textitHerschel Space Observatory. The CH lines in all four galaxies are a factor of 2 - 4 brighter than the adjacent HCN and HCO J = 6-5 lines (also detected in the same spectra). In the star formation dominated galaxies, M 82, NGC 253 and Arp 220, the CH/CO abundance ratio is low (1e-5), implying that the CH is primarily arising in diffuse and translucent gas where the chemistry is driven by UV radiation as found in the Milky Way ISM. In NGC 1068, which has a luminous AGN, the CH/CO ratio is an order of magnitude higher suggesting that CH formation is driven by an X-ray dominated region. Our XDR models show that both the CH and CO abundances in NGC 1068 can be explained by an XDR-driven chemistry for gas densities and molecular hydrogen column densities that are well constrained by the CO observations. We conclude that the CH/CO ratio may a good indicator of the presence of AGN in galaxies. We also discuss the feasibility of detecting CH in intermediate- to high-z galaxies with ALMA.",14,[],1
1407.7657,astro-ph,"The X-ray quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) at equation Hz in RE J1034396 has been robustly observed in the 0.2-10 keV band of one equation ks XMM-Newton observation, but was not detected in subsequent observations. Here, we investigate the power spectral density (PSD) of 8 archival XMM-Newton observations of RE J1034396, and search for the presence of QPOs in three energy bands: soft (0.3-0.8 keV); hard (1.0-4.0 keV) and total (0.2-10.0 keV). We find a significant detection of a QPO feature in the hard-band PSD of 5 low flux/spectrally-harder observations. The QPO frequency has remained persistent at equation Hz over equation years of observations, though it is no longer detected in the soft band, except in the original observation. This result increases the duration where the QPO is present by a factor of three (now equation ks), allowing for a better understanding of the QPO phenomenon observed in both Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and black hole X-ray binaries (BHBs).",14,[],1
1406.6547,astro-ph,"We analyze here two very bright fireballs produced by the ablation in the atmosphere of two large meteoroids in 2009 and 2010. These slow-moving and deep-penetrating events were observed over Spain in the framework of our Spanish Fireball Network continuous meteor monitoring campaign. The analysis of the emission spectrum imaged for one of these fireballs has provided the first clues about the chemical nature of the progenitor meteoroids. The orbital parameters of these particles suggests a likely association with the recently identified July rho-Herculid meteoroid stream. In addition, considerations about the likely parent body of this stream are also made on the basis of orbital dissimilarity criteria. This orbital analysis reveals that both meteoroids and PHA 2007LQ19 exhibit a similar evolution during a time period of almost 8,000 years, which suggests that either this NEO is the potential parent of these particles or that this NEO and both meteoroids had a common progenitor in the past.",14,[],1

1411.4928,astro-ph,"In this contribution to the volume in memoriam of Michel Henon, we thought appropriate to look at his early scientific work devoted to the dynamics of large assemblies of interacting masses. He predicted in his PhD thesis that, in such a system, first a collapse of mass occurs at the center and that later binaries stars are formed there. Henceforth, the negative energy of binding of pairs becomes a source of positive energy for the rest of the cluster which evaporate because of that. We examine under what conditions such a singularity can occur, and what could happen afterwards. We hope to show that this fascinating problem of evolution of self-gravitating clusters keeps its interest after the many years passed since Henon thesis, and is still worth discussing now.",14,[],1
1405.1216,astro-ph,"Supernovae have long been proposed to be efficient dust producers in galaxies. Observations in the mid-infrared indicate that dust forms a few hundred days after the stellar explosion. Yet, the chemical type and the amount of dust produced by supernovae are not well quantified.

1408.2668,astro-ph,"Understanding the physical conditions of dark molecular clouds and star forming regions is an inverse problem subject to complicated chemistry that varies non-linearly with time and the physical environment. In this paper we apply a Bayesian approach based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for solving the non-linear inverse problems encountered in astrochemical modelling. We use observations for ice and gas species in dark molecular clouds and a time dependent, gas grain chemical model to infer the values of the physical and chemical parameters that characterize quiescent regions of molecular clouds. We show evidence that in high dimensional problems, MCMC algorithms provide a more efficient and complete solution than more classical strategies. The results of our MCMC method enable us to derive statistical estimates and uncertainties for the physical parameters of interest as a result of the Bayesian treatment.",14,[],1
1410.4222,astro-ph,"We study the convergence properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) using numerical tests and simple analytic considerations. Our analysis shows that formal numerical convergence is possible in SPH only in the joint limit equation, equation, and equation, where equation is the total number of particles, equation is the smoothing length, and equation is the number of neighbor particles within the smoothing volume used to compute smoothed estimates. Previous work has generally assumed that the conditions equation and equation are sufficient to achieve convergence, while holding equation fixed. We demonstrate that if equation is held fixed as the resolution is increased, there will be a residual source of error that does not vanish as equation and equation. Formal numerical convergence in SPH is possible only if equation is increased systematically as the resolution is improved. Using analytic arguments, we derive an optimal compromise scaling for equation by requiring that this source of error balance that present in the smoothing procedure. For typical choices of the smoothing kernel, we find equation. This means that if SPH is to be used as a numerically convergent method, the required computational cost does not scale with particle number as equation, but rather as equation, where equation, with a weak dependence on the form of the smoothing kernel.",14,[],1
1408.2553,astro-ph,"We re-examine the fraction of low-redshift Sloan Digital Sky Survey satellites and centrals in which star formation has been quenched, using the environment quenching efficiency formalism that separates out the dependence of stellar mass. We show that the centrals of the groups containing the satellites are responding to the environment in the same way as their satellites (at least for stellar masses above 1010.3 Msun), and that the well-known differences between satellites and the general set of centrals arise because the latter are overwhelmingly dominated by isolated galaxies. The widespread concept of ""satellite quenching"" as the cause of environmental effects in the galaxy population can therefore be generalized to ""group quenching"". We then explore the dependence of the quenching efficiency of satellites on overdensity, group-centric distance, halo mass, the stellar mass of the satellite, and the stellar mass and specific star formation rate (sSFR) of its central, trying to isolate the effect of these often interdependent variables. We emphasize the importance of the central sSFR in the quenching efficiency of the associated satellites, and develop the meaning of this ""galactic conformity"" effect in a probabilistic description of the quenching of galaxies. We show that conformity is strong, and that it varies strongly across parameter space. Several arguments then suggest that environmental quenching and mass quenching may be different manifestations of the same underlying process. The marked difference in the apparent mass dependencies of environment quenching and mass quenching which produces distinctive signatures in the mass functions of centrals and satellites will arise naturally, since, for satellites at least, the distributions of the environmental variables that we investigate in this work are essentially independent of the stellar mass of the satellite.",14,[],1
1403.6128,astro-ph,"We present homogeneous and accurate iron abundances for 42 Galactic Cepheids based on high-spectral resolution (R~38,000) high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR>100) optical spectra collected with UVES at VLT (128 spectra). The above abundances were complemented with high-quality iron abundances provided either by our group (86) or available in the literature. We paid attention in deriving a common metallicity scale and ended up with a sample of 450 Cepheids. We also estimated for the entire sample accurate individual distances by using homogeneous near-infrared photometry and the reddening free Period-Wesenheit relations. The new metallicity gradient is linear over a broad range of Galactocentric distances (Rg~5-19 kpc) and agrees quite well with similar estimates available in the literature (-0.060/-0.002 dex/kpc). We also uncover evidence which suggests that the residuals of the metallicity gradient are tightly correlated with candidate Cepheid Groups (CGs). The candidate CGs have been identified as spatial overdensities of Cepheids located across the thin disk. They account for a significant fraction of the residual fluctuations, and in turn for the large intrinsic dispersion of the metallicity gradient. We performed a detailed comparison with metallicity gradients based on different tracers: OB stars and open clusters. We found very similar metallicity gradients for ages younger than 3 Gyrs, while for older ages we found a shallower slope and an increase in the intrinsic spread. The above findings rely on homogeneous age, metallicity and distance scales. Finally we found, by using a large sample of Galactic and Magellanic Cepheids for which are available accurate iron abundances, that the dependence of the luminosity amplitude on metallicity is vanishing.",14,[],1
1412.5785,astro-ph,"Context: The 440 Myr old main-sequence A-star Fomalhaut is surrounded by an eccentric debris belt with sharp edges. This sort of a morphology is usually attributed to planetary perturbations, but the orbit of the only planetary candidate detected so far, Fomalhaut b, is too eccentric to efficiently shape the belt. Alternative models that could account for the morphology without invoking a planet are stellar encounters and gas-dust interactions.   Aims: We aim to test the possibility of gas-dust interactions as the origin of the observed morphology by putting upper limits on the total gas content of the Fomalhaut belt.   Methods: We derive upper limits on the CII 158 equationm and OI 63 equationm emission by using non-detections from the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) onboard the Herschel Space Observatory. Line fluxes are converted into total gas mass using the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) code RADEX. We consider two different cases for the elemental abundances of the gas: solar abundances and abundances similar to those observed for the gas in the equation Pictoris debris disc.   Results: The gas mass is shown to be below the millimetre dust mass by a factor of at least equation3 (for solar abundances) respectively equation300 (for equation Pic-like abundances).   Conclusions: The lack of gas co-spatial with the dust implies that gas-dust interactions cannot efficiently shape the Fomalhaut debris belt. The morphology is therefore more likely due to a yet unseen planet (Fomalhaut c) or stellar encounters.",14,[],1
1411.3063,astro-ph,"We report the discovery of an ultra-faint stellar system in the constellation of Pegasus. This concentration of stars was detected by applying our overdensity detection algorithm to the SDSS-DR10 and confirmed with deeper photometry from the Dark Energy Camera at the 4-m Blanco telescope. The best-fitting model isochrone indicates that this stellar system, Kim 1, features an old (12 Gyr) and metal-poor ([Fe/H]equation) stellar population at a heliocentric distance of equation kpc. We measure a half-light radius of equation pc using a Plummer profile. The small physical size and the extremely low luminosity are comparable to the faintest known star clusters Segue 3, Koposov 1 & 2, and Mu\~noz 1. However, Kim 1 exhibits a lower star concentration and is lacking a well defined center. It also has an unusually high ellipticity and irregular outer isophotes, which suggests that we are seeing an intermediate mass star cluster being stripped by the Galactic tidal field. An extended search for evidence of an associated stellar stream within the 3 sqr deg DECam field remains inconclusive. The finding of Kim 1 is consistent with current overdensity detection limits and supports the hypothesis that there are still a substantial number of extreme low luminosity star clusters undetected in the wider Milky Way halo.",14,[],1
1412.6278,astro-ph,"In this paper we present the elementary assumptions of our research on the role of the magnetic field in modelling the quiescence-outbursts cycle in Cataclysmic Variables (CVs). The behaviour of the magnetic field is crucial not only to integrate the disk instability model (Osaki 1974), but also to determine the cause and effect nexus among parameters affecting the behavior of complex systems. On the ground of our interpretation of the results emerging from the literature, we suggest that in models describing DNe outbursts, such as the disk instability model, the secondary instability model (Bath 1973) and the thermonuclear runaway model (Mitrofanov 1978), the role of the magnetic field is at least twofold. On the one hand, it activates a specific dynamic pathway for the accreting matter by channelling it. On the other hand, it could be indirectly responsible for switching a particular outburst modality. In order to represent these two roles of the magnetic field, we need to integrate the disk instability model by looking at the global behaviour of the system under analysis. Stochastic resonance in dynamo models, we believe, is a suitable candidate for accomplishing this task. We shall present the MHD model including this mechanism elsewhere.",14,[],1
1406.7021,astro-ph,"The days of the lone astronomer with his optical telescope and photographic plates are long gone: Astronomy in 2025 will not only be multi-wavelength, but multi-messenger, and dominated by huge data sets and matching data rates. Catalogues listing detailed properties of billions of objects will in themselves require a new industrial-scale approach to scientific discovery, requiring the latest techniques of advanced data analytics and an early engagement with the first generation of cognitive computing systems. Astronomers have the opportunity to be early adopters of these new technologies and methodologies: the impact can be profound and highly beneficial to effecting rapid progress in the field. Areas such as SETI research might favourably benefit from cognitive intelligence that does not rely on human bias and preconceptions.",14,[],1
1401.6812,astro-ph,"Flux ropes are twisted magnetic structures, which can be detected by in situ measurements in the solar wind. However, different properties of detected flux ropes suggest different types of flux-rope population. As such, are there different populations of flux ropes? The answer is positive, and is the result of the analysis of four lists of flux ropes, including magnetic clouds (MCs), observed at 1 AU. The in situ data for the four lists have been fitted with the same cylindrical force-free field model, which provides an estimation of the local flux-rope parameters such as its radius and orientation. Since the flux-rope distributions have a large dynamic range, we go beyond a simple histogram analysis by developing a partition technique that uniformly distributes the statistical fluctuations over the radius range. By doing so, we find that small flux ropes with radius R<0.1 AU have a steep power-law distribution in contrast to the larger flux ropes (identified as MCs), which have a Gaussian-like distribution. Next, from four CME catalogs, we estimate the expected flux-rope frequency per year at 1 AU. We find that the predicted numbers are similar to the frequencies of MCs observed in situ. However, we also find that small flux ropes are at least ten times too abundant to correspond to CMEs, even to narrow ones. Investigating the different possible scenarios for the origin of those small flux ropes, we conclude that these twisted structures can be formed by blowout jets in the low corona or in coronal streamers.",14,[],1
1405.1043,astro-ph,"Observations indicate that galaxies with high stellar masses or in dense environments have low specific star formation rates, i.e. they are quenched. Based on cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include a prescription where quenching occurs in regions dominated by hot (>105 K) gas, we argue that this hot gas quenching in halos >1012 Msun drives both mass quenching (i.e. central quenching) and environment quenching (i.e. satellite quenching). These simulations reproduce a broad range of locally observed trends among quenching, halo mass, stellar mass, environment, and distance to halo center. We show that mass quenching is independent of environment because 1012-1013 Msun ""quenching halos"" -- those where most mass quenching occurs -- inhabit a large range of environments. On the other hand, environment quenching is independent of stellar mass because galaxies of all stellar masses may live in dense environments as satellites of groups and clusters. Furthermore, satellite galaxies show signs of mass quenching independent of halo mass because massive satellites at z=0 have typically been mass quenched as centrals in their own hot halos at higher z -- a kind of pre-processing. As in observations, the fraction of quenched satellites increases with halo mass and decreases with distance to the center of the group or cluster. We investigate quenched centrals in low-mass halos (<1012 Msun), and show that most of these are ejected former satellites of groups or clusters, while about 20 per cent were never satellites but are enveloped in hot gas that extends up to 3 Rvir from the centers of clusters. The agreement of our model with key observational trends suggests that hot gas in massive halos plays a leading role in quenching low-redshift galaxies.",14,[],1

The C2 Swan bands are weak in V532 Oph relative to R CrB.

1410.2743,astro-ph,"High-energy letter-rays, which are produced by powerful relativistic jets, are usually associated with blazars and radio galaxies. In the current active galactic nuclei (AGN) paradigm, such jets are almost exclusively launched from massive elliptical galaxies. Recently, however, Fermi/LAT detected letter-rays from a few narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies and thus confirmed the presence of relativistic jets in them. Since NLS1 galaxies are assumed to be young evolving AGN, they offer a unique opportunity to study the production of relativistic jets in late-type galaxies. Our aim is to estimate by which processes the emission of various kinds is produced in NLS1 galaxies and to study how emission properties are connected to other intrinsic AGN properties. We have compiled the so far largest multiwavelength database of NLS1 sources. This allowed us to explore correlations between different wavebands and source properties using, for example, Pearson and Spearman correlations and principal component analysis. We did this separately for radio-loud and radio-quiet sources. Multiwavelength correlations suggest that radio-loud sources host relativistic jets that are the predominant sources of radio, optical, and X-ray emission. The origin of infrared emission remains unclear. Radio-quiet sources do not host a jet, or the jet is very weak. In them, radio and infrared emission is more likely generated via star formation processes, and the optical and X-ray emission originate in the inner parts of the AGN. We also find that the black hole mass correlates significantly with radio loudness, which suggests that NLS1 galaxies with more massive black holes are more likely to be able to launch powerful relativistic jets.",14,[],1
1412.1776,astro-ph,"Out of nine known stable Mars Trojans, seven appear to be members of an orbital grouping including the largest Trojan, Eureka. In order to test if this could be a genetic family, we simulated the long term evolution of a tight orbital cluster centered on Eureka. We explored two cases: cluster dispersal through planetary gravity alone over 1 Gyr, and a 1 Gyr evolution due to both gravity and the Yarkovsky effect. We find that the dispersal of the cluster in eccentricity is primarily due to dynamical chaos, while the inclinations and libration amplitudes are primarily changed by the Yarkovsky effect. Current distribution of the cluster members orbits are indicative of an initially tight orbital grouping that was affected by a negative acceleration (i.e. one against the orbital motion) consistent with the thermal Yarkovsky effect. We conclude that the cluster is a genetic family formed either in a collision or through multiple rotational fissions. The cluster's age is on the order of 1 Gyr, and its long-term orbital evolution is likely dominated by the seasonal, rather than diurnal, Yarkovsky effect. If confirmed, Gyr-scale dominance of the seasonal Yarkovsky effect may indicate suppression of the diurnal Yarkovsky drift by the related YORP effect. Further study of Mars Trojans is essential for understanding the long-term orbital and rotational dynamics of small bodies in the absence of frequent collisions.",14,[],1
1404.7168,astro-ph,"Comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) will have a close encounter with Mars on October 19, 2014. We model the dynamical evolution of dust grains from the time of their ejection from the comet nucleus to the Mars close encounter, and determine the flux at Mars. Constraints on the ejection velocity from Hubble Space Telescope observations indicate that the bulk of the grains will likely miss Mars, although it is possible that a few-percent of grains with higher velocities will reach Mars, peaking approximately 90--100 minutes after the close approach of the nucleus, and consisting mostly of millimeter-radius grains ejected from the comet nucleus at a heliocentric distance of approximately 9~AU or larger. At higher velocities, younger grains from sub-millimeter to several millimeter can reach Mars too, although an even smaller fraction of grains is expected have these velocities, with negligible effect on the peak timing. Using NEOWISE observations of the comet, we can estimate that the maximum fluence will be of the order of equation grains/mequation. We include a detailed analysis of how the expected fluence depends on the grain density, ejection velocity, and size-frequency distribution, to account for current model uncertainties and in preparation of possible refined model values in the near future.",14,[],1
1402.2466,astro-ph,"We study the time evolution of the impact probability for synthetic but realistic impacting and close approaching asteroids detected in a simulated all-sky survey. We use the impact probability to calculate the impact warning time as the time interval between when an object reaches a Palermo Scale value of -2 and when it impacts Earth. A simple argument shows that warning time ~ Dx with the exponent in the range [1.0,1.5] and our derived value was equation. The low-precision astrometry from the single simulated all-sky survey could require many days or weeks to establish an imminent impact for asteroids >100m diameter that are discovered far from Earth. Most close approaching asteroids are quickly identified as not being impactors but a size-dependent percentage, even for those >50m diameter, have a persistent impact probability of >10-6 on the day of closest approach. Thus, a single all-sky survey can be of tremendous value in identifying Earth impacting and close approaching asteroids in advance of their closest approach but it can not solve the problem on its own: high-precision astrometry from other optical or radar systems is necessary to rapidly establish an object as an impactor or close approacher. We show that the parallax afforded by surveying the sky from two sites is only of benefit for a small fraction of the smallest objects detected within a couple days before impact: probably not enough to justify the increased operating costs of a 2-site survey. Finally, the survey cadence within a fixed time span is relatively unimportant to the impact probability calculation. We tested three different reasonable cadences and found that one provided ~10x higher (better) value for the impact probability on the discovery night for the smallest (10m diameter) objects but the consequences on the overall impact probability calculation is negligible.",14,[],1
1411.5863,astro-ph,"The observation of galaxy and gas distributions, as well as cosmological simulations in a equationCDM Universe, suggests that clusters of galaxies are still accreting mass and are not expected to be in equilibrium. In this work, we investigate the possibility to evaluate the departure from virial equilibrium in order to detect, in that balance, effects from a Dark Matter--Dark Energy interaction. We continue, from previous works, using a simple model of interacting dark sector, the Layzer--Irvine equation for dynamical virial evolution, and employ optical observations in order to obtain the mass profiles through weak lensing and X-ray observations giving the intracluster gas temperatures. Through a Monte Carlo method, we generate, for a set of clusters, measurements of observed virial ratios, interaction strength, rest virial ratio and departure from equilibrium factors. We found a compounded interaction strength of equation, compatible with no interaction, but also a compounded rest virial ratio of equation, which would entail a equation detection. We confirm quantitatively that clusters of galaxies are out of equilibrium but further investigation is needed to constrain a possible interaction in the dark sector.",14,[],1
1401.5815,astro-ph,"We present the first three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the atmosphere of HD 209458b which self-consistently include reduction of winds due to the Lorentz force and Ohmic heating. We find overall wind structures similar to that seen in previous models of hot Jupiter atmospheres, with strong equatorial jets and meridional flows poleward near the day side and equatorward near the night side. Inclusion of magnetic fields slows those winds and leads to Ohmic dissipation. We find wind slowing ranging from 10%-40% for reasonable field strengths. We find Ohmic dissipation rates ~1017 W at 100 bar, orders of magnitude too small to explain the inflated radius of this planet. Faster wind speeds, not achievable in these anelastic calculations, may be able to increase this value somewhat, but likely will not be able to close the gap necessary to explain the inflated radius. We demonstrate that the discrepancy between the simulations presented here and previous models is due to inadequate treatment of magnetic field geometry and evolution. Induced poloidal fields become much larger than those imposed, highlighting the need for a self-consistent MHD treatment of these hot atmospheres.",14,[],1
1408.3987,astro-ph,"The role of diffuse photospheric magnetic elements in the energy budget of the upper layers of the Sun's atmosphere has been the recent subject of many studies. This was made possible by the availability of high temporal and spatial resolution observations of the solar photosphere, allowing large numbers of magnetic elements to be tracked to study their dynamics. In this work we exploit a long temporal series of seeing-free magnetograms of the solar photosphere to study the effect of the turbulent convection in the excitation of kink oscillations in magnetic elements. We make use of the empirical mode decomposition technique (EMD) in order to study the transverse oscillations of several magnetic flux tubes. This technique permits the analysis of non-stationary time series like those associated to the horizontal velocities of these flux tubes which are continuously advected and dispersed by granular flows.   Our primary findings reveal the excitation of low frequency modes of kink oscillations, which are sub-harmonics of a fundamental mode with a equation minute periodicity. These results constitute a strong case for observational proof of the excitation of kink waves by the buffeting of the convection cells in the solar photosphere, and are discussed in light of their possible role in the energy budget of the upper Sun's atmosphere.",14,[],1
1406.5187,astro-ph,"Recent observations have shown that star-forming galaxies like our own Milky Way evolve kinematically into ordered thin disks over the last ~8 billion years since z=1.2, undergoing a process of ""disk settling."" For the first time, we study the kinematic evolution of a suite of four state of the art ""zoom in"" hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation and evolution in a fully cosmological context and compare with these observations. Until now, robust measurements of the internal kinematics of simulated galaxies were lacking as the simulations suffered from low resolution, overproduction of stars, and overly massive bulges. The current generation of simulations has made great progress in overcoming these difficulties and is ready for a kinematic analysis. We show that simulated galaxies follow the same kinematic trends as real galaxies: they progressively decrease in disordered motions (sigmag) and increase in ordered rotation (Vrot) with time. The slopes of the relations between both sigmag and Vrot with redshift are consistent between the simulations and the observations. In addition, the morphologies of the simulated galaxies become less disturbed with time, also consistent with observations, and they both have similarly large scatter. This match between the simulated and observed trends is a significant success for the current generation of simulations, and a first step in determining the physical processes behind disk settling.",14,[],1

1409.7388,astro-ph,"We resolve spatially the star formation history of 300 nearby galaxies from the CALIFA integral field survey to investigate: a) the radial structure and gradients of the present stellar populations properties as a function of the Hubble type; and b) the role that plays the galaxy stellar mass and stellar mass surface density in governing the star formation history and metallicity enrichment of spheroids and the disks of galaxies. We apply the fossil record method based on spectral synthesis techniques to recover spatially and temporally resolved maps of stellar population properties of spheroids and spirals with galaxy mass from 10equation to 7equation10equation Mequation. The individual radial profiles of the stellar mass surface density (equation), stellar extinction (Aequation), luminosity weighted ages (equation log age equation), and mass weighted metallicity (equation log Z/Zequationequation) are stacked in seven bins of galaxy morphology (E, S0, Sa, Sb, Sbc, Sc and Sd). All these properties show negative gradients as a sight of the inside-out growth of massive galaxies. However, the gradients depend on the Hubble type in different ways. For the same galaxy mass, E and S0 galaxies show the largest inner gradients in equation; and Andromeda-like galaxies (Sb with log Mequation(Mequation) equation 11) show the largest inner age and metallicity gradients. In average, spiral galaxies have a stellar metallicity gradient equation -0.1 dex per half-light radius, in agreement with the value estimated for the ionized gas oxygen abundance gradient by CALIFA. A global (Mequation-driven) and local (equation- driven) stellar metallicity relation are derived.

1404.0252,astro-ph,"The familiar correlation between the speed and angular width of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is also found in solar cycle 24, but the regression line has a larger slope: for a given CME speed, cycle 24 CMEs are significantly wider than those in cycle 23. The slope change indicates a significant change in the physical state of the heliosphere, due to the weak solar activity. The total pressure in the heliosphere (magnetic  plasma) is reduced by ~40%, which leads to the anomalous expansion of CMEs explaining the increased slope. The excess CME expansion contributes to the diminished effectiveness of CMEs in producing magnetic storms during cycle 24, both because the magnetic content of the CMEs is diluted and also because of the weaker ambient fields. The reduced magnetic field in the heliosphere may contribute to the lack of solar energetic particles accelerated to very high energies during this cycle.",14,[],1

1411.5320,astro-ph,"Certain instrumental effects and data reduction anomalies introduce systematic errors in photometric time-series. Detrending algorithms such as the Trend Filtering Algorithm (TFA) (Kov\'acs et al. 2004) have played a key role in minimizing the effects caused by these systematics.

Tests performed on this data show that by applying these two filtering methods together, the photometric RMS is on average improved by a factor of 3-4, with better efficiency towards brighter magnitudes, while applying TFA alone yields an improvement of a factor 1-2. As a result of this improvement, we are able to detect and analyze a large number of stars per TFRM-PSES field which present some kind of variability. Also, after porting these algorithms to Python and parallelizing them, we have improved, even for large data samples, the computing performance of the overall detrendingBLS algorithm by a factor of equation10 with respect to Kov\'acs et al.

1408.5135,astro-ph,"We trace the formation and advection of several elements within a cosmological adaptive mesh refinement simulation of an L* galaxy. We use nine realisations of the same initial conditions with different stellar Initial Mass Functions (IMFs), mass limits for type-II and type-Ia supernovae (SNII, SNIa) and stellar lifetimes to constrain these sub-grid phenomena. Our code includes self-gravity, hydrodynamics, star formation, radiative cooling and feedback from multiple sources within a cosmological framework. Under our assumptions of nucleosynthesis we find that SNII with progenitor masses of up to 100 Msun are required to match low metallicity gas oxygen abundances. Tardy SNIa are necessary to reproduce the classical chemical evolution knee in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H]: more prompt SNIa delayed time distributions do not reproduce this feature. Within our framework of hydrodynamical mixing of metals and galaxy mergers we find that chemical evolution is sensitive to the shape of the IMF and that there exists a degeneracy with the mass range of SNII.

This paper presents photometry, detection rates, dust masses and temperatures using an optically selected sample from the Fornax Cluster Catalogue (FCC).

In Fornax, we detect 30 of the 237 (13%) optically selected galaxies in at least one equation band. The global detection rates are significantly lower than Virgo, reflecting the morphological make up of each cluster - Fornax has a lower fraction of late-type galaxies.

Detected early-type galaxies (E/S0) have a mean dust mass, temperature, and dust-to-stars ratio of equation, equationK, and equation, respectively. Late-type galaxies (Sa to Sd) have a mean dust mass, temperature, and dust-to-stars ratio of equation, equationK, and equation, respectively.

The interstellar reddenings, metallicities, distances, and ages have been compared to the literature values. Significant differences are usually due to the usage of diverse empirical calibrations and differing assumptions, such as concerning cluster metallicity, as well as distinct isochrones which correspond to differing element-abundance ratios, internal stellar physics, and photometric systems. Different interstellar reddenings, as well as varying reduction and cluster-membership techniques, are also responsible for these kinds of systematic differences and errors.   The morphological ages, which are derived from the morphological indices (equation and equation) in the CM diagrams, are in good agreement with the isochrone ages of 12 O\!Cs, those with good red clump (RC) and red giant (RG) star candidates. No metal abundance gradient is detected for the range equation kpc, nor any correlation between the cluster ages and metal abundances for these 20 O\!Cs.

1402.0677,astro-ph,"We present an updated version of the so-called Madau model for the attenuation by the intergalactic neutral hydrogen against the radiation from distant objects. First, we derive a distribution function of the intergalactic absorbers from the latest observational statistics of the Lyequation forest, Lyman limit systems, and damped Lyequation systems. The distribution function excellently reproduces the observed redshift evolutions of the Lyequation depression and of the mean-free-path of the Lyman continuum simultaneously. Then, we derive a set of the analytic functions which describe the mean intergalactic attenuation curve for objects at equation. The new model predicts less (or more) Lyequation attenuation for equation--5 (equation) sources through usual broad-band filters relative to the original Madau model. This may cause a systematic difference in the photometric redshift estimates, which is, however, still as small as about 0.05.

We measure a Rp/Rs in the white light curve of 0.159880.00133-0.00145.

1406.4120,astro-ph,"Evolution in the X-ray luminosity -- star formation rate (equation-SFR) relation could provide the first evidence of a top-heavy stellar initial mass function in the early universe, as the abundance of high-mass stars and binary systems are both expected to increase with decreasing metallicity. The sky-averaged (global) 21-cm signal has the potential to test this prediction via constraints on the thermal history of the intergalactic medium, since X-rays can most easily escape galaxies and heat gas on large scales. A significant complication in the interpretation of upcoming 21-cm measurements is the unknown spectrum of accreting black holes at high-equation, which depends on the mass of accreting objects and poorly constrained processes such as how accretion disk photons are processed by the disk atmosphere and host galaxy interstellar medium. Using a novel approach to solving the cosmological radiative transfer equation (RTE), we show that reasonable changes in the characteristic BH mass affects the amplitude of the 21-cm signal's minimum at the equation mK level --- comparable to errors induced by commonly used approximations to the RTE --- while modifications to the intrinsic disk spectrum due to Compton scattering (bound-free absorption) can shift the position of the minimum of the global signal by equation (equation), and modify its amplitude by up to equation mK (equation mK) for a given accretion history. Such deviations are larger than the uncertainties expected of current global 21-cm signal extraction algorithms, and could easily be confused with evolution in the equation-SFR relation.",14,[],1
1410.1510,astro-ph,"We explore voids in dark matter and halo fields from simulations of equationCDM and Hu-Sawicki equation models. In equation gravity, dark matter void abundances are greater than that of general relativity (GR). However, when using haloes to identify voids, the differences of void abundances become much smaller, but can still be told apart, in principle, at the 2, 6 and 14 equation level for the equation model parameter amplitudes of equation, equation and equation. In contrast, the abundance of large voids found using haloes in equation gravity is lower than in GR. The more efficient halo formation in underdense regions makes equation voids less empty of haloes. This counter intuitive result suggests that voids are not necessarily emptier in equation if one looks at galaxies in voids. Indeed, the halo number density profiles of voids are not distinguishable from GR. However, the same equation voids are more empty of dark matter. This can in principle be observed by weak gravitational lensing of voids, for which the combination of a spec-equation and a photo-equation survey over the same sky is necessary. For a volume of 1~(Gpc/equation)equation, neglecting the lensing shape noise, equation and equation may be distinguished from GR using the lensing tangential shear signal around voids by 4 and 8equation. The line-of-sight projection of large-scale structure is the main systematics that limits the significance of this signal, limiting the constraining power for equation. The halo void abundance being smaller and the steepening of dark matter void profiles in equation models are unique features that can be combined to break the degeneracy between equation and equation.

1411.0192,astro-ph,"We analyse sunspot oscillations using Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) slit-jaw and spectral data and narrow-band chromospheric images from the New Solar Telescope (NST) for the main sunspot in NOAA AR 11836. We report that the difference between the shock arrival times as measured the Mg II k 2796.35\AA\ and Si IV 1393.76\AA\ line formation levels changes during the observed period and peak-to-peak delays may range from 40~s to zero. The intensity of chromospheric shocks also displays a long term (about 20~min) variations. NST's high spatial resolution \ha\ data allowed us to conclude that in this sunspot umbral flashes (UFs) appeared in the form of narrow bright lanes stretched along the light bridges and around clusters of umbral bright points. Time series also suggested that UFs preferred to appear on the sunspot-center side of light bridges, which may indicate the existence of a compact sub-photospheric driver of sunspot oscillations. The sunspot's umbra as seen in the IRIS chromospheric and transition region data appears bright above the locations of light bridges and the areas where the dark umbra is dotted with clusters of umbral dots. Co-spatial and co-temporal data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board Solar Dynamics Observatory showed that the same locations were associated with bright footpoints of coronal loops suggesting that the light bridges may play an important role in heating the coronal sunspot loops. Finally, the power spectra analysis showed that the intensity of chromospheric and transition region oscillations significantly vary across the umbra and with height, suggesting that umbral non-uniformities and the structure of sunspot magnetic fields may play a role in wave propagation and heating of umbral loops.",14,[],1
1403.0814,astro-ph,"Transverse oscillatory motions and recurrence behavior in the chromospheric jets observed by Hinode/SOT are studied. A comparison is considered with the behavior that was noticed in coronal X-ray jets observed by Hinode/XRT. A jet like bundle observed at the limb in Ca II H line appears to show a magnetic topology that is similar to X-ray jets (i.e., the Eiffel tower shape). The appearance of such magnetic topology is usually assumed to be caused by magnetic reconnection near a null point. Transverse motions of the jet axis are recorded but no clear evidence of twist is appearing from the highly processed movie. The aim is to investigate the dynamical behavior of an incompressible magnetic X-point occurring during the magnetic reconnection in the jet formation region. The viscous effect is specially considered in the closed line-tied magnetic X-shape nulls. We perform the MHD numerical simulation in 2-D by solving the visco-resistive MHD equations with the tracing of velocity and magnetic field. A qualitative agreement with Hinode observations is found for the oscillatory and non-oscillatory behaviors of the observed solar jets in both the chromosphere and the corona. Our results suggest that the viscous effect contributes to the excitation of the magnetic reconnection by generating oscillations that we observed at least inside this Ca II H line cool solar jet bundle.",14,[],1
1402.2512,astro-ph,"We present a family of self-consistent axisymmetric stellar systems that have analytic distribution functions (DFs) of the form f(J), so they depend on three integrals of motion and have triaxial velocity ellipsoids. The models, which are generalisations of Henon's isochrone sphere, have four dimensionless parameters, two determining the part of the DF that is even in Lz, and two determining the odd part of the DF (which determines the azimuthal velocity distribution). Outside their cores, the velocity ellipsoids of all models tend to point to the model's centre, and we argue that this behaviour is generic, so near the symmetry axis of a flattened model, the long axis of the velocity ellipsoid is naturally aligned with the symmetry axis and not perpendicular to it as in many published dynamical models of well-studied galaxies. By varying one of the DF's parameters, the intensity of rotation can be increased from zero up to a maximum value set by the requirement that the DF be non-negative. Since angle-action coordinates are easily computed for these models, they are ideally suited for perturbative treatments and stability analysis. They can also be used to choose initial conditions for an N-body model that starts in perfect equilibrium and to model observations of early-type galaxies. The modelling technique introduced here is readily extended to different radial density profiles, more complex kinematics, and multi-component systems. A number of important technical issues surrounding the determination of the models' observable properties are explained in two appendices.",14,[],1

1412.1302,astro-ph,"The data recently accumulated by the Kepler mission have demonstrated that small planets are quite common and that a significant fraction of all stars may have an Earth-like planet within their Habitable Zone. These results are combined with a Drake-equation formalism to derive the space density of biotic planets as a function of the relatively modest uncertainty in the astronomical data and of the (yet unknown) probability for the evolution of biotic life, Fb. I suggest that Fb may be estimated by future spectral observations of exoplanet biomarkers. If Fb is in the range 0.001 -- 1 then a biotic planet may be expected within 10 -- 100 light years from Earth. Extending the biotic results to advanced life I derive expressions for the distance to putative civilizations in terms of two additional Drake parameters - the probability for evolution of a civilization, Fc, and its average longevity. For instance, assuming optimistic probability values (Fb Fc 1) and a broadcasting longevity of a few thousand years, the likely distance to the nearest civilizations detectable by SETI is of the order of a few thousand light years. The probability of detecting intelligent signals with present and future radio telescopes is calculated as a function of the Drake parameters. Finally, I describe how the detection of intelligent signals would constrain the Drake parameters.",14,[],1
1409.5836,astro-ph,"The new generation of IR surveys are revealing and quantifying Galactic features, providing an improved 3-D interpretation of our own Galaxy. We present an analysis of the global distribution of dust clouds in the bulge using the near-IR photometry of 157 million stars from the VVV Survey. We investigate the color magnitude diagram of the Milky Way bulge which shows a red giant clump of core He burning stars that is split in two color components, with a mean color difference of (Z-Ks)=0.55 magnitudes equivalent to AV=2.0 magnitudes. We conclude that there is an optically thick dust lane at intermediate latitudes above and below the plane, that runs across several square degrees from l=-10 deg to l=10 deg. We call this feature the ""Great Dark Lane"". Although its exact distance is uncertain, it is located in front of the bulge. The evidence for a large-scale great dark lane within the Galactic bulge is important in order to constrain models of the barred Milky Way bulge and to compare our galaxy with external barred galaxies, where these kinds of features are prominent. We discuss two other potential implications of the presence of the Great Dark Lane for microlensing and bulge stellar populations studies.",14,[],1
1407.6269,astro-ph,"We use a modified pulsar current analysis to study magnetic field decay in radio pulsars. In our approach we analyse the flow, not along the spin period axis as has been performed in previous studies, but study the flow along the direction of growing characteristic age, equation. We perform extensive tests of the method and find that in most of the cases it is able to uncover non-negligible magnetic field decay (more than a few tens of per cent during the studied range of ages) in normal radio pulsars for realistic initial properties of neutron stars. However, precise determination of the magnetic field decay timescale is not possible at present. The estimated timescale may differ by a factor of few for different sets of initial distributions of neutron star parameters. In addition, some combinations of initial distributions and/or selection effects can also mimic enhanced field decay. We apply our method to the observed sample of radio pulsars at distances equation kpc in the range of characteristic ages equation years where, according to our study, selection effects are minimized. By analysing pulsars in the Parkes Multibeam and Swinburne surveys we find that, in this range, the field decays roughly by a factor of two. With an exponential fit this corresponds to the decay time scale equation yrs. With larger statistics and better knowledge of the initial distribution of spin periods and magnetic field strength, this method can be a powerful tool to probe magnetic field decay in neutron stars.",14,[],1
1409.5051,astro-ph,"A detection technique of ultra-high energy cosmic rays, complementary to the fluorescence technique, would be the use of the molecular Bremsstrahlung radiation emitted by low-energy electrons left after the passage of the showers in the atmosphere. The emission mechanism is expected from quasi-elastic collisions of electrons produced in the shower by the ionisation of the molecules in the atmosphere. In this article, a detailed calculation of the spectral intensity of photons at ground level originating from the transitions between unquantised energy states of free ionisation electrons is presented. In the absence of absorption of the emitted photons in the plasma, the obtained spectral intensity is shown to be 5 10-26 W m-2Hz-1 at 10 km from the shower core for a vertical shower induced by a proton of 1017.5 eV.",14,[],1

Methods: We used data from the XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray observatories to measure X-ray source temperatures and luminosities as well as the gas column densities along the line of sight toward the source. Results: We report a Chandra X-ray detection of HBC 722 with an X-ray luminosity of LX ~ 4E30 erg s-1. The gas column density exceeds values expected from optical extinction and standard gas-to-dust ratios. We conclude that dust-free gas masses are present around the star, such as strong winds launched from the inner disk, or massive accretion columns.

All the observations were made using the SIRPOL imaging polarimeter on the Infrared Survey Facility 1.4 m telescope at the South African Astronomical Observatory. We present the polarization properties of ten sub-regions in six star-forming regions. The polarization patterns, extents, and maximum degrees of linear and circular polarizations are used to determine the prevalence and origin of CP in the star-forming regions. Our results show that the CP pattern is quadrupolar in general, the CP regions are extensive, up to 0.65 pc, the CP degrees are high, up to 20 %, and the CP degrees decrease systematically from high- to low-mass young stellar objects. The results are consistent with dichroic extinction mechanisms generating the high degrees of CP in star forming regions.",14,[],1
1410.0886,astro-ph,"The 30-Hz rotation rate of the Crab pulsar has been monitored at Jodrell Bank Observatory since 1984 and by other observatories before then. Since 1968, the rotation rate has decreased by about equation\,Hz, interrupted only by sporadic and small spin up events (glitches). 24 of these events have been observed, including a significant concentration of 15 occurring over an interval of 11 years following MJD 50000. The monotonic decrease of the slowdown rate is partially reversed at glitches. This reversal comprises a step and an asymptotic exponential with a 320-day time constant, as determined in the three best-isolated glitches. The cumulative effect of all glitches is to reduce the decrease in slowdown rate by about 6\%. Overall, a low mean braking index of equation is measured for the whole period, compared with values close to equation in intervals between glitches. Removing the effects of individual glitches reveals an underlying power law slowdown with the same braking index of 2.5. We interpret this value in terms of a braking torque due to a dipolar magnetic field in which the inclination angle between the dipole and rotation axes is increasing. There may also be further effects due to a monopolar particle wind or infalling supernova debris.",14,[],1
1410.2410,astro-ph,"Non-thermal electrons accelerated in the solar corona can produce intense coherent radio emission, known as solar type III radio bursts. This intense radio emission is often observed from hundreds of MHz in the corona down to the tens of kHz range in interplanetary space. It involves a chain of physical processes from the generation of Langmuir waves to nonlinear processes of wave-wave interaction. We develop a self-consistent model to calculate radio emission from a non-thermal electron population over large frequency range, including the effects of electron transport, Langmuir wave-electron interaction, the evolution of Langmuir waves due to non-linear wave-wave interactions, Langmuir wave conversion into electromagnetic emission, and finally escape of the electromagnetic waves. For the first time we simulate escaping radio emission over a broad frequency range from 500~MHz down to a few MHz and infer key properties of the radio emission observed: the onset (starting) frequency, identification as fundamental or harmonic emission, peak flux density, instantaneous frequency bandwidth, and timescales for rise and decay. Comparing with the observations, these large scale simulations enable us to identify the processes governing the key type III solar radio burst characteristics.",14,[],1
1401.2460,astro-ph,"We compare state-of-the-art semi-analytic models of galaxy formation as well as advanced sub-halo abundance matching models with a large sample of early-type galaxies from SDSS at z < 0.3. We focus our attention on the dependence of median sizes of central galaxies on host halo mass. The data do not show any difference in the structural properties of early-type galaxies with environment, at fixed stellar mass. All hierarchical models considered in this work instead tend to predict a moderate to strong environmental dependence, with the median size increasing by a factor of about 1.5-3 when moving from low to high mass host haloes. At face value the discrepancy with the data is highly significant, especially at the cluster scale, for haloes above log Mhalo > 14. The convolution with (correlated) observational errors reduces some of the tension. Despite the observational uncertainties, the data tend to disfavour hierarchical models characterized by a relevant contribution of disc instabilities to the formation of spheroids, strong gas dissipation in (major) mergers, short dynamical friction timescales, and very short quenching timescales in infalling satellites. We also discuss a variety of additional related issues, such as the slope and scatter in the local size-stellar mass relation, the fraction of gas in local early-type galaxies, and the general predictions on satellite galaxies.",14,[],1

The abundances of O, Ne and Mg show tight correlations between each other in the range of about two orders of magnitude, suggesting them all from explosive C/Ne burning. Meanwhile, the abundances of Si and S are also well correlated, indicating them to be the ashes of explosive explosive O-burning or incomplete Si-burbing. The Fe emission lines are not prominent among the whole remnant, and its abundance are significantly deduced, indicating that the reverse shock may have not propagated to the Fe-rich ejecta.

1401.2150,astro-ph,"Axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) can be invoked for describing astrophysical magnetized flows and formulated to model stellar magnetospheres including main sequence stars (e.g. the Sun), compact stellar objects [e.g. magnetic white dwarfs (MWDs), radio pulsars, anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs), magnetars, isolated neutron stars etc.], and planets as a major step forward towards a full three-dimensional model construction. Using powerful and reliable numerical solvers based on two distinct finite-difference method (FDM) and finite-element method (FEM) schemes of algorithm, we examine axisymmetric steady-state or stationary MHD models in Throumoulopoulos & Tasso (2001), finding that their separable semi-analytic nonlinear solutions are actually not unique given their specific selection of several free functionals and chosen boundary conditions. The multiplicity of nonlinear steady MHD solutions gives rise to differences in the total energies contained in the magnetic fields and flow velocity fields as well as in the asymptotic behaviours approaching infinity, which may in turn explain why numerical solvers tend to converge to a nonlinear solution with a lower energy than the corresponding separable semi-analytic one. By properly adjusting model parameters, we invoke semi-analytic and numerical solutions to describe different kind of scenarios, including nearly parallel case and the situation in which the misalignment between the fluid flow and magnetic field is considerable. We propose that these MHD models are capable of describing the magnetospheres of MWDs as examples of applications with moderate conditions (including magnetic field) where the typical values of several important parameters are consistent with observations. We discuss the challenges of developing numerical extrapolation MHD codes in view of nonlinear degeneracy.",14,[],1
1411.2859,astro-ph,"This paper considers the stability of tidal equilibria for planetary systems in which stellar rotation provides a significant contribution to the angular momentum budget. We begin by applying classic stability considerations for two bodies to planetary systems --- where one mass is much smaller than the other. The application of these stability criteria to a subset of the Kepler sample indicates that the majority of the systems are not in a stable equilibrium state. Motivated by this finding, we generalize the stability calculation to include the quadrupole moment for the host star. In general, a stable equilibrium requires that the total system angular momentum exceeds a minimum value (denoted here as equation) and that the orbital angular momentum of the planet exceeds a minimum fraction of the total. Most, but not all, of the observed planetary systems in the sample have enough total angular momentum to allow an equilibrium state. Even with the generalizations of this paper, however, most systems have too little orbital angular momentum (relative to the total) and are not in an equilibrium configuration. Finally, we consider the time evolution of these planetary systems; the results constrain the tidal quality factor of the stars and suggest that equation.",14,[],1

1408.3638,astro-ph,"We study the Lya profiles of 36 spectroscopically-detected Lya-emitters (LAEs) at z2-3, using Keck MOSFIRE to measure systemic redshifts and velocity dispersions from rest-frame optical nebular emission lines. The sample has a median optical magnitude R=26.0, and ranges from R23 to R>27, corresponding to rest-frame UV absolute magnitudes MUV-22 to MUV>-18.2. Dynamical masses range from Mdyn<1.3e8 Msun to Mdyn=6.8e9 Msun, with a median value of Mdyn=6.3e8 Msun. Thirty of the 36 Lya emission lines are redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity with at least 1 sigma significance, and the velocity offset with respect to systemic dvLya is correlated with R-band magnitude, MUV, and the velocity dispersion measured from nebular emission lines with >3 sigma significance: brighter galaxies with larger velocity dispersions tend to have larger values of dvLya. We also make use of a comparison sample of 122 UV-color-selected R<25.5 galaxies at z2, all with Lya emission and systemic redshifts measured from nebular emission lines. Using the combined LAE and comparison samples for a total of 158 individual galaxies, we find that dvLya is anti-correlated with the Lya equivalent width with 7 sigma significance. Our results are consistent with a scenario in which the Lya profile is determined primarily by the properties of the gas near the systemic redshift; in such a scenario, the opacity to Lya photons in lower mass galaxies may be reduced if large gaseous disks have not yet developed and if the gas is ionized by the harder spectrum of young, low metallicity stars.",14,[],1
1401.4497,astro-ph,"We present time resolved X-ray spectroscopy of the microquasar GRS1915105 with the MAXI observatory in order to study the accretion state just before and during the ejections associated with its major flares. Radio monitoring with the RATAN-600 radio telescope from 4.8 - 11.2 GHz has revealed two large steep spectrum major flares in the first eight months of 2013. Since, the RATAN receives one measurement per day, we cannot determine the jet forming time without more information. Fortunately, this is possible since a distinct X-ray light curve signature that occurs preceding and during major ejections has been determined in an earlier study. The X-ray luminosity spikes to very high levels in the hours before ejection then becomes variable (with a nearly equal X-ray luminosity when averaged over the duration of the ejection) during a brief 3 to 8 hour ejection process. By comparing this X-ray behavior to MAXI light curves, we can estimate the beginning and end of the ejection episode of the strong 2013 flares to within equation3 hours. Using this estimate in conjunction with time resolved spectroscopy from the data in the MAXI archives allows us to deduce that the X-ray absorbing hydrogen column density increases significantly in the hours preceding the ejections and remains elevated during the ejections responsible for the major flares. This finding is consistent with an out-flowing wind or enhanced accretion at high latitudes.",14,[],1
1406.1099,astro-ph,"One attractive scenario for the excess of sub-PeV/PeV neutrinos recently reported by IceCube is that they are produced by cosmic rays in starburst galaxies colliding with the dense interstellar medium. These proton-proton (equation) collisions also produce high-energy gamma-rays, which finally contribute to the diffuse high-energy gamma-ray background. We calculate the diffuse gamma-ray flux with a semi-analytic approach and consider that the very high energy gamma-rays will be absorbed in the galaxies and converted into electron-position pairs, which then lose almost all their energy through synchrotron radiation in the strong magnetic fields in the starburst region. Since the synchrotron emission goes into energies below GeV, this synchrotron loss reduces the diffuse high-energy gamma-ray flux by a factor of about two, thus leaving more room for other sources to contribute to the gamma-ray background. For a equation neutrino spectrum, we find that the diffuse gamma-ray flux contributes about 20% of the observed diffuse gamma-ray background in the 100 GeV range. However, for a steeper neutrino spectrum, this synchrotron loss effect is less important, since the energy fraction in absorbed gamma-rays becomes lower.",14,[],1

The BCs contain some phenomenological parameters which implicitly depend on both bulk Hamiltonian parameters and crystal potential behavior near the crystal surface. Space symmetry reduces the number of the boundary parameters to four real parameters in the 2D case and three in the 3D case. We found that the boundary parameters may strongly affect not only an energy spectrum but even the very existence of these states inside the bulk gap near the Brillouin zone center. Nevertheless, we reveal in frames of the tight-binding model that when surface states do not exist in the bulk gap in the Brillouin zone center they cross the gap in other points of the Brillouin zone in agreement with the bulk-boundary correspondence.",14,[],8

This allows us to treat both the quantum and thermal fluctuations together in an integrated way. A plain SGPE only allows for thermal fluctuations. The approach is applicable to such situations as finite temperature quantum quenches, but not equilibrium calculations due to the time limitations inherent in positive-P descriptions of interacting gases.

1401.5103,cond-mat,"The control of physical properties of solids with short laser pulses is an intriguing prospect of ultrafast materials science. Continuous-wave high-frequency laser driving with circular polarization was predicted to induce a light-matter coupled new state possessing a quasi-static band structure with an energy gap and a quantum Hall effect, coined ""Floquet topological insulator"". Whereas the envisioned Floquet topological insulator requires well separated Floquet bands and therefore high-frequency pumping, a natural follow-up question regards the creation of Floquet-like states in graphene with realistic pump laser pulses. Here we predict that with short low-frequency laser pulses attainable in pump-probe experiments, states with local spectral gaps at the Dirac points and novel pseudospin textures can be achieved in graphene using circular light polarization. We demonstrate that time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy can track these states by measuring sizeable energy gaps and quasi-Floquet energy bands that form on femtosecond time scales. By analyzing Floquet energy level crossings and snapshots of pseudospin textures near the Dirac points, we identify transitions to new states with optically induced nontrivial changes of sublattice mixing that can lead to Berry curvature corrections of electrical transport and magnetization.",14,[],8

In both cases we find an interaction-induced enhancement of the efficiency at maximum power (EMP) as compared to non-interacting motors. The EMP enhancement occurs for a wide range of network and single motor parameters and is due to a change in the characteristic load-velocity relation caused by phase transitions in the system. Using a quantitative measure of the trade-off between the EMP enhancement and the corresponding loss in the maximum output power we identify parameter regimes where motor traffic systems operate efficiently at maximum power without a significant decrease in the maximum power output due to jamming effects.,14,[],8

1412.0943,cond-mat,"Graphene is an interesting material for spintronics, showing long spin relaxation lengths even at room temperature. For future spintronic devices it is important to understand the behavior of the spins and the limitations for spin transport in structures where the dimensions are smaller than the spin relaxation length. However, the study of spin injection and transport in graphene nanostructures is highly unexplored. Here we study the spin injection and relaxation in nanostructured graphene with dimensions smaller than the spin relaxation length. For graphene nanoislands, where the edge length to area ratio is much higher than for standard devices, we show that enhanced spin-flip processes at the edges do not seem to play a major role in the spin relaxation. On the other hand, contact induced spin relaxation has a much more dramatic effect for these low dimensional structures. By studying the nonlocal spin transport through a graphene quantum dot we observe that the obtained values for spin relaxation are dominated by the connecting graphene islands and not by the quantum dot itself. Using a simple model we argue that future nonlocal Hanle precession measurements can obtain a more significant value for the spin relaxation time for the quantum dot by using high spin polarization contacts in combination with low tunneling rates.",14,[],8

1406.5087,cond-mat,"For cold atomic systems, varying the optical lattice potential periodically provides a general and simple way to drive the system into phases with nontrivial topology. Besides its simplicity, this driving approach, compared to the usual driving approach by exerting an external electromagnetic field to the static system, has the merit that it does not break the original static system's time-reversal symmetry at any given time. Based on this approach, we find that a trivial insulator with time-reversal symmetry can be driven into a Floquet quantum spin Hall insulator. This novel state of matter can stably host one or two pair of gapless helical states on the same boundary, which suggests this state is not a simple analog of the quantum spin Hall insulator. The effect of a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking periodic perturbation, the stability of the novel states, and this new driving approach to a system without time-reversal symmetry are discussed.",14,[],8
1407.3369,cond-mat,"Ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS) and density functional theory methods are used to predict structures of calcium and magnesium carbonate (CaCOequation and MgCOequation) at high pressures. We find a previously unknown CaCOequation structure which is more stable than the aragonite and ""post aragonite"" phases in the range 32--48 GPa. At pressures from 67 GPa to well over 100 GPa the most stable phase is a previously unknown CaCOequation structure of the pyroxene type with fourfold coordinated carbon atoms. We also predict a stable structure of MgCOequation in the range 85--101 GPa. Our results lead to a revision of the phase diagram of CaCOequation over more than half the pressure range encountered within the Earth's mantle, and smaller changes to the phase diagram of MgCOequation. We predict CaCOequation to be more stable than MgCOequation in the Earth's mantle above 100 GPa, and that COequation is not a thermodynamically stable compound under deep mantle conditions. Our results have significant implications for understanding the Earth's deep carbon cycle.",14,[],8
1403.3570,cond-mat,"Understanding tunneling from an atomically sharp tip to a metallic surface requires to account for interactions on a nanoscopic scale. Inelastic tunneling of electrons generates emission of photons, whose energies intuitively should be limited by the applied bias voltage. However, experiments by Schull et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 057401 (2009)] indicate that more complex processes involving the interaction of electrons with plasmon polaritons lead to photon emission characterized by over-bias energies. We propose a model of this observation in analogy to dynamical Coulomb blockade, originally developed for treating the electronic environment in mesoscopic circuits. We explain the experimental finding quantitatively by the correlated tunneling of two electrons interacting with an LRC circuit modeling the local plasmon-polariton mode. To explain the over-bias emission, the non-Gaussian statistics of the tunneling dynamics of the electrons is essential.",14,[],8

In addition to the tricritical point, the possibility of disordered and quadrupolar phases occurrence was shown. For mixed crystals with tin by lead substitution, the investigated ultrasound, hypersound and low frequency dielectric properties also reveal appearance of heterophase peculiarities at decreasing of ferroelectric transition temperature below so named ""temperature waterline"" near 250~K. The tricriticality at similar temperature level also appears in mixed crystals at sulfur by selenium substitution.

We show that the effective exponent decays algebraically to an asymptotic value equation that depends upon the initial condition. More precisely, we find that equation takes one universal value equation for initial conditions with short-range spatial correlations as in a paramagnetic state, and the value equation for initial conditions with the long-range spatial correlations of the critical Ising state. We checked universality by working with a square and a triangular lattice, and by imposing free and periodic boundary conditions. We found that the effective exponent suffers from stronger finite size effects in the former case.",14,[],8
1403.5514,cond-mat,"The observation of vortices in superconductors was a major breakthrough in developing the conceptual background for superconducting applications. Each vortex carries a flux quantum, and the magnetic field radially decreases from the center. Techniques used to make magnetic field maps, such as magnetic decoration, give vortex lattice images in a variety of systems. However, strong type II superconductors allow penetration of the magnetic field over large distances, of order of the magnetic penetration depth letter. Superconductivity survives up to magnetic fields where, for imaging purposes, there is nearly no magnetic contrast. Static and dynamic properties of vortices are largely unknown at such high magnetic fields. Reciprocal space studies using neutron scattering give insight into the collective behavior. But the microscopic details of vortex arrangements and their motion remain difficult to obtain. Direct real space visualization can be made using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S). Instead of using magnetic contrast, the electronic density of states describes spatial variations of the quasiparticle and pair wavefunction properties. These are of order of the superconducting coherence length letter, which is much smaller than letter. In principle, individual vortices can be imaged using STM up to the upper critical field where vortex cores, of size letter, overlap. In this review, we describe recent advances in vortex imaging made with scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We introduce the technique and discuss vortex images which reveal the influence of the Fermi surface distribution of the superconducting gap on the internal structure of vortices, the collective behavior of the lattice in different materials and conditions, and the observation of vortex lattice melting.",14,[],8
1410.3535,cond-mat,"Rheological properties of dense flows of hard particles are singular as one approaches the jamming threshold where flow ceases, both for aerial granular flows dominated by inertia, and for over-damped suspensions. Concomitantly, the lengthscale characterizing velocity correlations appears to diverge at jamming. Here we introduce a theoretical framework that proposes a tentative, but potentially complete scaling description of stationary flows. Our analysis, which focuses on frictionless particles, applies \it both to suspensions and inertial flows of hard particles. We compare our predictions with the empirical literature, as well as with novel numerical data. Overall we find a very good agreement between theory and observations, except for frictional inertial flows whose scaling properties clearly differ from frictionless systems. For over-damped flows, more observations are needed to decide if friction is a relevant perturbation or not. Our analysis makes several new predictions on microscopic dynamical quantities that should be accessible experimentally.",14,[],8

We are also able to predict a further hierarchy of new models that will emerge as data quality improves to better resolve the underlying continuity of animal movement. Finally, we also show that Langevin equations must obey a fluctuation-dissipation theorem to generate processes that fall from this class of maximum-entropy distributions.",14,[],8

For quantum phase transitions (PT) with zero critical temperature, these relations are proved to be of different form. This fact has been actually observed experimentally, but the reasons were not quite clear. A general formula containing the classical results as a special case is proposed. This formula is applicable to all equilibrium PT of any space dimension.

1403.3259,cond-mat,"Normally the role of phase fluctuations in superfluids and superconductors is to drive a phase transition to the normal state. This happens due to proliferation of topologically nontrivial phase fluctuations in the form of vortices. Here we discuss a class of systems where, by contrast, nontopological phase fluctuations can produce superfluidity. Here we understand superfluidity as a phenomenon that does not necessarily arises from a broken equation symmetry, but can be associated with a certain class of (approximate or exact) degeneracies of the systems energy landscape giving raise to a equation-like phase.",14,[],8

Such a ferrimagnetic order leads to the emergence of new properties that are absent in ferromagnetic centrosymmetric Heusler structures. In terms of the band structure calculations, we explain the formation of this magnetic order and the Curie temperatures.

We present a simple expression for the transition rate that takes into account many-body effects through a transition matrix element of the contact. In a thermal gas, the width of the peak in the transition rate as a function of the frequency is determined by the temperature. In a dilute Bose-Einstein condensate of atoms, the width is determined by the inelastic scattering rates of a dimer with zero-energy atoms. Near an atom-dimer resonance, there is a dramatic increase in the width from inelastic atom-dimer scattering and from atom-atom-dimer recombination. The recombination contribution provides a signature for universal tetramers that are Efimov states consisting of two atoms and a dimer.",14,[],8
1407.0828,cond-mat,"Structural and thermodynamic consistency of coarse-graining models across multiple length scales is essential for the predictive role of multi-scale modeling and molecular dynamic simulations that use mesoscale descriptions. Our approach is a coarse-grained model based on integral equation theory, which can represent polymer chains at variable levels of chemical details. The model is analytical and depends on molecular and thermodynamic parameters of the system under study, as well as on the direct correlation function in the k to 0 limit, c0. A numerical solution to the PRISM integral equations is used to determine c0, by adjusting the value of the effective hard sphere diameter, d, to agree with the predicted equation of state. This single quantity parameterizes the coarse-grained potential, which is used to perform mesoscale simulations that are directly compared with atomistic-level simulations of the same system. We test our coarse-graining formalism by comparing structural correlations, isothermal compressibility, equation of state, Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies, and potential energy and entropy using both united atom and coarse-grained descriptions. We find quantitative agreement between the analytical formalism for the thermodynamic properties, and the results of Molecular Dynamics simulations, independent of the chosen level of representation. In the mesoscale description, the potential energy of the soft-particle interaction becomes a free energy in the coarse-grained coordinates which preserves the excess free energy from an ideal gas across all levels of description. The structural consistency between the united-atom and mesoscale descriptions means the relative entropy between descriptions has been minimized without any variational optimization parameters. The approach is general and applicable to any polymeric system in different thermodynamic conditions.",14,[],8

We present the detailed temperature dependence of the dispersion relation and compare our calculated neutron scattering cross section with recent experimental measurements. We analyze the thermal resistivity's variation with temperature and clarify misconceptions about existing experimental literature.

1405.3300,cond-mat,"We develop a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC) method for quantum impurities coupled to interacting quantum wires described by a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. The method is negative-sign free for any values of the Tomonaga-Luttinger parameter, which is rigorously proved, and thus, efficient low-temperature calculations are possible. Duality between electrons and bosons in one dimensional systems allows us to construct a simple formula for the CTQMC algorithm in these systems. We show that the CTQMC for Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids can be implemented with only minor modifications of previous CTQMC codes developed for impurities coupled to non-interacting fermions. We apply this method to the Kane-Fisher model of a potential scatterer in a spin-less quantum wire and to a single spin coupled with the edge state of a two-dimensional topological insulator assuming an anisotropic XXZ coupling.

Acoustic technologies frequently develop in tandem with optics, using shared concepts such as waveguiding and metamedia. It is thus noteworthy that an entirely novel class of electromagnetic waves, known as topological edge states, has recently been demonstrated. These are inspired by the electronic edge states occurring in topological insulators, and possess a striking and technologically promising property: the ability to travel in a single direction along a surface without backscattering, regardless of the existence of defects or disorder. Here, we develop an analogous theory of topological fluid acoustics, and propose a scheme for realizing topological edge states in an acoustic structure containing circulating fluids.

1407.7996,cond-mat,"We present a comprehensive set of first principles electronic structure calculations to study transition metal solutes and their interactions with point defects in austenite. Clear trends were observed across the series. Solute-defect interactions were strongly correlated to the solute size factors, consistent with local strain field effects. Strong correlations with results in ferrite show insensitivity to the underlying crystal structure in Fe. Oversized solutes act as strong traps for vacancy and self-interstitial defects and as nucleation sites for the development of proto-voids and small self-interstitial loops. The reduction in defect mobility and net defect concentrations explains the observed radiation-damage resistance in austenitic steels doped with oversized solutes. Oversized solutes remaining dissolved in oxide dispersion-strengthened (ODS) steels could contribute to their radiation-damage resistance. Ni and Co diffuse more slowly than Fe, along with any vacancy flux produced under irradiation below a critical temperature, which is 400 K for Co and their concentrations should be enhanced at defect sinks. Cr and Cu diffuse more quickly than Fe, against a vacancy flux and will be depleted at defect sinks. Oversized solutes early in the transition metal series form highly-stable solute-centred divacancy (SCD) defects with a nearest-neighbour vacancy. The vacancy-mediated diffusion of these solutes is dominated by the dissociation and reassociation of the SCDs, with a lower activation energy than for self-diffusion, which has important implications for the nucleation and growth of complex oxide nanoparticles containing these solutes in ODS steels. Interstitial-mediated solute diffusion is energetically disfavoured for all except Cr, Mn, Co and Ni. The central role that solute size plays in the results presented here means they should apply to other solvent metals and alloys.",14,[],8

The corresponding equations of motion are developed, which are used to study the quantum interference effect and phonon-induced decoherence dynamics in molecular junctions. Numerical studies show clearly quantum interference effect of the transport electrons through two quasi-degenerate states with different coupling to the leads. We also found that the quantum interference can be suppressed by the electron-phonon interaction where the phase coherence is destroyed by phonon scattering.

Here we demonstrate that an ultracold atomic condensate of hard-core bosons with contact interaction can establish a supersolid phase when simultaneously subjected to spin-orbit coupling and a spin-dependent periodic potential. This supersolid phase is accompanied by topologically nontrivial spin textures, and is signaled by the separation of momentum distribution peaks, which can be detected via time-of-flight measurements.

Pr has an approximate doublet ground-state and the first excited state is a singlet. This overall crystal field level scheme is similar to metallic PrequationIrequationOequation, which is also reported here. While the B-site (Ru) is well ordered throughout, this is not the case for the A-site (Pr/Bi). A distribution of the Pr-O2 bond length indicates the Pr environment is not uniform even for equation. The Bi environment is highly disordered ostensibly due to the 6s lone pairs on Biequation. Correspondingly we find the non-Kramers doublet ground state degeneracy otherwise anticipated for Pr in the pyrochlore structure is lifted so as to produce a quadrupolar singlet ground state with a spatially varying energy gap. For equation, below Tequation, the Ru sublattice orders antiferromagnetically, with propagation vector \textbfk= (0,0,0), as for YequationRuequationOequation. No ordering associated with the Pr sublattice is observed down to 100 mK. The low energy magnetic response of PrequationBiequationRuequationOequation features a broad spectrum of magnetic excitations associated with inhomogeneous splitting of the Pr quasi-doublet ground state. For equation (equation) the spectrum is temperature dependent (independent).

Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we find that the corresponding Fermi surfaces, subband masses, and orbital ordering are different from the ones at the (001) surface of SrTiO3. This occurs because the crystallographic symmetries of the surface and sub-surface planes, and the electron effective masses along the confinement direction, influence the symmetry of the electronic structure and the orbital ordering of the t2g manifold. Remarkably, our analysis of the data also reveals that the carrier concentration and thickness are similar for all three surface orientations, despite their different polarities. The orientational tuning of the microscopic properties of two-dimensional electron states at the surface of SrTiO3 echoes the tailoring of macroscopic (e.g. transport) properties reported recently in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (110) and (111) interfaces, and is promising for searching new types of 2D electronic states in correlated-electron oxides.",14,[],8

1402.4878,cond-mat,"We present a theoretical analysis of low frequency dynamics of a single-channel mesoscopic capacitor, which is composed by a quantum dot connected to an electron reservoir via a single quantum channel. At low frequencies, it is known that the Wigner-Smith delay time equation plays a dominant role and it can be interpreted as the time delay between the current leaving the dot and the current entering the dot. At higher frequencies, we find that another characteristic time equation can also be important. It describes the deformation of the leaving current to the entering one and hence can be referred as the deformation time. At sufficient low temperatures, the deformation time equation can be approximated from the second-order derivative of equation via a simple relation equation. As the temperature increases, this relation breaks down and one has instead equation in the high temperature limit. We further show that the deformation time equation can have a pronounced influence on the quantum inductance equation of the mesoscopic capacitor, leading to features different from the ones of the quantum capacitance. The most striking one is that equation can change its sign as the temperature increases: It can go from positive values at low temperatures to large negative values at high temperatures.

1410.0491,cond-mat,"Universality of the extraordinary Hall effect scaling was tested in granular three-dimensional Ni-SiO2 films across the metal-insulator transition. Three types of magnetotransport behavior have been identified: metallic, weakly insulating and strongly insulating. Scaling between both the ordinary and extraordinary Hall effects and material resistivity is absent in the weakly insulating range characterized by logarithmic temperature dependence of conductivity. The results provide compelling experimental confirmation to recent models of granular metals predicting transition from logarithmic to exponential conductivity temperature dependence when inter-granular conductance drops below the quantum conductance value and loss of Hall effect scaling when inter-granular conductance is higher than the quantum one. The effect was found at high temperatures and reflects the granular structure of material rather than low temperature quantum corrections.",14,[],8

The approach is illustrated with a model system comprised of graphene stacked atop hexagonal-boron-nitride. In this case, the Berry curvature of the electron Bloch bands is highly sensitive to the stacking configuration. As a result, electron topology can be controlled by crystal axes alignment, granting a practical route to designer topological materials.

Therefore, the presence of a BEC makes the direct use of the cluster-expansion approach --- lucrative e.g. in semiconductor quantum optics --- inefficient when solving the many-body kinetics of a strongly interacting Bose. An excitation picture is introduced with a nonunitary transformation that exclusively describes the system in terms of atom clusters within the normal component alone. The nontrivial properties of this transformation are systematically studied, which yields a cluster-expansion friendly formalism for a strongly interacting Bose gas. Its connections and corrections to the standard Hartree-Fock Bogoliubov approach are discussed and the role of the order parameter and the Bogoliubov excitations are identified. The resulting interaction effects are shown to visibly modify number fluctuations of the BEC. Even when the BEC has a nearly perfect second-order coherence, the BEC number fluctuations can still resolve interaction-generated non-Poissonian fluctuations.",14,[],8

In this Letter we present strong evidence that the latter is the case.

Here we report high 2D elastic moduli of CVD monolayer MoS2 and WS2 (~ 170 N/m), which is very close to the value of exfoliated MoS2 monolayers and almost half the value of the strongest material, graphene. The 2D moduli of their bilayer heterostructures are lower than the sum of 2D modulus of each layer, but comparable to the corresponding bilayer homostructure, implying similar interactions between the hetero monolayers as between homo monolayers.

Self-assembly into a periodic pattern of equation/equation-rich microdomains (microphase separation) is controlled by the equation incompatibility equation inversely proportional to temperature. Our model aims to capture the system's essential microscopic features, including an ensemble of random networks that reflects spatial correlations at the instant of cross-linking. We identify suitable order parameters and derive a free-energy functional in the spirit of Landau theory that allows us to trace a phase diagram in the plane of equation and equation. Selective cross-links promote microphase separation at higher critical temperatures than in uncross-linked diblock copolymer melts. Microphase separation in the liquid state facilitates gelation, giving rise to a novel gel state whose chemical composition density mirrors the periodic equation pattern.",14,[],8
1410.7782,cond-mat,"Long range correlations in two-dimensional (2D) systems are significantly altered by disorder potentials. Theory has predicted the existence of disorder induced phenomena such as Anderson localization and the emergence of novel glass and insulating phases as the Bose glass. More recently, it has been shown that disorder breaking the 2D continuous symmetry, such as a one dimensional (1D) modulation, can enhance long range correlations. Experimentally, developments in quantum gases have allowed the observation of a wealth of phenomena induced by the competition between interaction and disorder. However, there are no experiments exploring the effect of symmetry-breaking disorder. Here, we create a 2D vortex lattice at 0.1 K in a superconducting thin film with a well-defined 1D thickness modulation and track the field induced modification using scanning tunneling microscopy. We find that the 1D modulation becomes incommensurate to the vortex lattice and drives an order-disorder transition, behaving as a scale-invariant disorder potential. We show that the transition occurs in two steps and is mediated by the proliferation of topological defects. We find that critical exponents determining the loss of positional and orientational order are far above theoretical expectations for scale-invariant disorder and follow instead the critical behaviour which describes dislocation unbinding melting. Our data show for the first time that randomness disorders a 2D crystal, and evidence enhanced long range correlations in presence of a 1D modulation demonstrating the transformation induced by symmetry breaking disorder in interactions and the critical behaviour of the transition.",14,[],8

Using a parallel-tempering Monte Carlo algorithm, we find that the model undergoes a continuous phase transition at finite temperature, which belongs to the Ising universality class. The properties of the bond structure and the ground-state entropy are also studied.

The composite layers were prepared under the action of a static magnetic field, resulting in anisotropic inclusion structures with the formation of chains of magnetite particles parallel to the faces of the layers. In one kind of bilayers, a composite layer was formed on top of a resin layer while their relative thickness was varied. These samples can be described by known models. In contrast, bilayers with the same concentration of inclusions and the same thickness on both sides, where only the angle between their inclusion structures was systematically varied, show a nontrivial behaviour of their thermal conductivity as a function of this angle.

We find that in the case of perpendicular scattering (the incident neutron beam is perpendicular to the applied magnetic field) if twice the cross section along the direction orthogonal to both the field and the neutron beam is subtracted from the cross section along the field direction, the result has only a third-order contribution (the lower-order terms are canceled). This difference does not depend on the amplitude of the exchange inhomogeneities and provides a separate gateway for a deeper analysis of the sample's magnetic structure.

For spinful electrons, the exciton phase is shown to be distinct from the usual quasi-long range ordered Wigner crystal phase characterized by power-law density wave correlations. The two phases can be clearly distinguished through their inter-wire tunneling current-voltage characteristics. In the quasi-exciton condensate phase the tunneling conductivity diverges at low temperatures and voltages, whereas in the Wigner crystal it is strongly suppressed. Both phases are characterized by a divergent Coulomb drag at low temperature.

Equations of motion for the system volume and effective temperature are derived. It is shown that for this case the non-equilibrium decomposition process is well approximated as one of constant entropy, that is, as thermodynamically reversible. This generalized theory is compared, with no adjustable parameters, to experimental light scattering data of Bailey and Cannell. It is found that this adiabatic theory is in satisfactory agreement with this data throughout the early stage. It is also shown that at later times the Kawasaki and Ohta theory predicts that the peak wavevector equation of the structure factor scales with time as equation, with equation.

Conventional multi-label learning approaches mainly focus on exploiting label correlations.

This problem is especially typical when the number instances is very large, and the labeling cost is very high, which makes it almost impossible to get a fully labeled training set. In this paper, we study the problem of large-scale multi-label learning with incomplete label assignments.

In this work, we present a computational framework based on deep network to demonstrate that proto-object representations can be learned from low-resolution image patches from fixation regions. We advocate the use of low-resolution inputs in this work due to the following reasons: (1) Proto-objects are computed in parallel over an entire visual field (2) People can perceive or recognize objects well even it is in low resolution. (3) Fixations from lower resolution images can predict fixations on higher resolution images. In the proposed computational model, we extract multi-scale image patches on fixation regions from eye fixation datasets, resize them to low resolution and feed them into a hierarchical. With layer-wise unsupervised feature learning, we find that many proto-objects like features responsive to different shapes of object blobs are learned out.

In particular, the considered confidence regions are non-asymptotic, this meaning that the number of required measurements is finite. Distributed solutions for the computation of non-asymptotic confidence regions are proposed, suited to wireless sensor networks scenarios. Their performances are compared in terms of required traffic load, both analytically and numerically. The evidence emerging from the conducted investigations is that the best solution for information exchange depends on whether the network topology is structured or unstructured. The effect on the computation of confidence regions of information diffusion truncation is also examined. In particular, it is proven that consistent confidence regions can be computed even when an incomplete set of measurements is available.",14,[],7
1408.6290,cs,"This article presents the mathematical background of general interactive systems. The first principle of designing a large system is to divide and conquer, which implies that we could possibly reduce human error if we divided a large system in smaller subsystems. Interactive systems are, however, often composed of many subsystems that are organically connected to one another and thus difficult to divide. In other words, we cannot apply a framework of set theory to the programming of interactive systems. We can overcome this difficulty by applying a framework of category theory (Kleisli category) to the programming, but this requires highly abstract mathematics, which is not very popular. In this article we introduce the fundamental idea of category theory using only lambda calculus, and then demonstrate how it can be used in the practical design of an interactive system. Finally, we mention how this discussion relates to category theory.",14,[],7
1412.1424,cs,"People regularly share items using online social media. However, people's decisions around sharing---who shares what to whom and why---are not well understood. We present a user study involving 87 pairs of Facebook users to understand how people make their sharing decisions. We find that even when sharing to a specific individual, people's own preference for an item (individuation) dominates over the recipient's preferences (altruism). People's open-ended responses about how they share, however, indicate that they do try to personalize shares based on the recipient. To explain these contrasting results, we propose a novel process model of sharing that takes into account people's preferences and the salience of an item. We also present encouraging results for a sharing prediction model that incorporates both the senders' and the recipients' preferences. These results suggest improvements to both algorithms that support sharing in social media and to information diffusion models.",14,[],7

1403.7692,cs,"This study develops a hybrid ensemble-variational approach for solving data assimilation problems. The method, called TR-4D-EnKF, is based on a trust region framework and consists of three computational steps. First an ensemble of model runs is propagated forward in time and snapshots of the state are stored. Next, a sequence of basis vectors is built and a low-dimensional representation of the data assimilation system is obtained by projecting the model state onto the space spanned by the ensemble deviations from the mean. Finally, the low-dimensional optimization problem is solved in the reduced-space using a trust region approach; the size of the trust region is updated according to the relative decrease of the reduced order surrogate cost function. The analysis state is projected back onto the full space, and the process is repeated with the current analysis serving as a new background. A heuristic approach based on the trust region size is proposed in order to adjust the background error statistics from one iteration to the next. Experimental simulations are carried out using the Lorenz and the quasi-geostrophic models. The results show that TR-4D-EnKF is an efficient computational approach, and is more accurate than the current state of the art 4D-EnKF implementations such as the POD-4D-EnKF and the Iterative Subspace Minimization methods.",14,[],7

Because a direct solution has an O(equation) cost, iterative Krylov methods are often used with fast matrix-vector products. For poorly conditioned problems, convergence of the iteration is slow and preconditioning becomes necessary. We investigate preconditioning from the viewpoint of scalability and efficiency. The problems that conventional preconditioners face when applied to kernel methods are demonstrated. A \emphnovel flexible preconditioner that not only improves convergence but also allows utilization of fast kernel matrix-vector products is introduced. The performance of this preconditioner is first illustrated on synthetic data, and subsequently on a suite of test problems in kernel regression and geostatistical kriging.",14,[],7
1405.5572,cs,"We consider the problem of inferring the opinions of a social network through strategically sampling a minimum subset of nodes by exploiting correlations in node opinions. We first introduce the concept of information dominating set (IDS). A subset of nodes in a given network is an IDS if knowing the opinions of nodes in this subset is sufficient to infer the opinion of the entire network. We focus on two fundamental algorithmic problems: (i) given a subset of the network, how to determine whether it is an IDS; (ii) how to construct a minimum IDS. Assuming binary opinions and the local majority rule for opinion correlation, we show that the first problem is co-NP-complete and the second problem is NP-hard in general networks. We then focus on networks with special structures, in particular, acyclic networks. We show that in acyclic networks, both problems admit linear-complexity solutions by establishing a connection between the IDS problems and the vertex cover problem. Our technique for establishing the hardness of the IDS problems is based on a novel graph transformation that transforms the IDS problems in a general network to that in an odd-degree network. This graph transformation technique not only gives an approximation algorithm to the IDS problems, but also provides a useful tool for general studies related to the local majority rule. Besides opinion sampling for applications such as political polling and market survey, the concept of IDS and the results obtained in this paper also find applications in data compression and identifying critical nodes in information networks.",14,[],7

Given a linear representation of equation we consider the problem of finding a linear representation of the equation-truncation of this matroid. This problem can be abstracted out to the following problem on matrices. Let equation be a equation matrix over a field equation. A \em rank equation-truncation of the matrix equation is a equation matrix equation (over equation or a related field) such that for every subset equation of size at most equation, the set of columns corresponding to equation in equation has rank equation if and only of the corresponding set of columns in equation has rank equation. Finding rank equation-truncation of matrices is a common way to obtain a linear representation of equation-truncation of linear matroids, which has many algorithmic applications. A common way to compute a rank equation-truncation of a equation matrix is to multiply the matrix with a random equation matrix (with the entries from a field of an appropriate size), yielding a simple randomized algorithm. So a natural question is whether it possible to obtain a rank equation-truncations of a matrix, \em deterministically. In this paper we settle this question for matrices over any finite field or the field of rationals (equation). We show that given a matrix equation over a field equation we can compute a equation-truncation equation over the ring equation in deterministic polynomial time.",14,[],7
1411.2714,cs,"We propose a multicast scheduling scheme to exploit content reuse when there is asynchronicity in user requests. A unicast transmission setup is used for content delivery, while multicast transmission is employed opportunistically to reduce wireless resource usage. We then develop a multicast scheduling scheme for the downlink multiple-input multiple output orthogonal-frequency division multiplexing system in IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network (WLAN). At each time slot, the scheduler serves the users by either unicast or multicast transmission. Out-sequence data received by a user is stored in user's cache for future use.Multicast precoding and user selection for multicast grouping are also considered and compliance with the IEEE 802.11 WLAN transmission protocol. The scheduling scheme is based on the Lyapunov optimization technique, which aims to maximize system rate. The resulting scheme has low complexity and requires no prior statistical information on the channels and queues. Furthermore, in the absence of channel error, the proposed scheme restricts the worst case of frame dropping deadline, which is useful for delivering real-time traffic.

1404.4026,cs,"Good quality video coding for low bit-rate applications is important for transmission over narrow-bandwidth channels and for storage with limited memory capacity. In this work, we develop a previous analysis for image compression at low bit-rates to adapt it to video signals. Improving compression using down-scaling in the spatial and temporal dimensions is examined. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that at low bit-rates, we benefit from applying spatio-temporal scaling. The proposed method includes down-scaling before the compression and a corresponding up-scaling afterwards, while the codec itself is left unmodified. We propose analytic models for low bit-rate compression and spatio-temporal scaling operations. Specifically, we use theoretic models of motion-compensated prediction of available and absent frames as in coding and frame-rate up-conversion (FRUC) applications, respectively. The proposed models are designed for multi-resolution analysis. In addition, we formulate a bit-allocation procedure and propose a method for estimating good down-scaling factors of a given video based on its second-order statistics and the given bit-budget.

1405.5047,cs,"Traditional approaches to upper body pose estimation using monocular vision rely on complex body models and a large variety of geometric constraints. We argue that this is not ideal and somewhat inelegant as it results in large processing burdens, and instead attempt to incorporate these constraints through priors obtained directly from training data. A prior distribution covering the probability of a human pose occurring is used to incorporate likely human poses. This distribution is obtained offline, by fitting a Gaussian mixture model to a large dataset of recorded human body poses, tracked using a Kinect sensor. We combine this prior information with a random walk transition model to obtain an upper body model, suitable for use within a recursive Bayesian filtering framework. Our model can be viewed as a mixture of discrete Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, in that states behave as random walks, but drift towards a set of typically observed poses. This model is combined with measurements of the human head and hand positions, using recursive Bayesian estimation to incorporate temporal information. Measurements are obtained using face detection and a simple skin colour hand detector, trained using the detected face. The suggested model is designed with analytical tractability in mind and we show that the pose tracking can be Rao-Blackwellised using the mixture Kalman filter, allowing for computational efficiency while still incorporating bio-mechanical properties of the upper body. In addition, the use of the proposed upper body model allows reliable three-dimensional pose estimates to be obtained indirectly for a number of joints that are often difficult to detect using traditional object recognition strategies. Comparisons with Kinect sensor results and the state of the art in 2D pose estimation highlight the efficacy of the proposed approach.",14,[],7

1409.2457,cs,"The problem of efficiently computing and visualizing the structural resemblance between a pair of protein backbones in 3D has led Bereg et al. to pose the Chain Pair Simplification problem (CPS).

In this paper we study the complexity of CPS under the discrete \frechet\ distance (CPS-3F), i.e., where the quality of the simplifications is also measured by the discrete \frechet\ distance. Since CPS-3F was posed in 2008, its complexity has remained open. However, it was believed to be \npc, since CPS under the Hausdorff distance (CPS-2H) was shown to be \npc. We first prove that the weighted version of CPS-3F is indeed weakly \npc\, even on the line, based on a reduction from the set partition problem. Then, we prove that CPS-3F is actually polynomially solvable, by presenting an equation time algorithm for the corresponding minimization problem. In fact, we prove a stronger statement, implying, for example, that if weights are assigned to the vertices of only one of the chains, then the problem remains polynomially solvable.

1403.4075,cs,"We consider the problem of distributed load balancing in heterogenous parallel server systems, where the service rate achieved by a user at a server depends on both the user and the server. Such heterogeneity typically arises in wireless networks (e.g., servers may represent frequency bands, and the service rate of a user varies across bands). Users select servers in a distributed manner. They initially attach to an arbitrary server. However, at random instants of time, they may probe the load at a new server and migrate there to improve their service rate. We analyze the system dynamics under the natural Random Local Search (RLS) migration scheme, introduced in \citesig10. Under this scheme, when a user has the opportunity to switch servers, she does it only if this improves her service rate. The dynamics under RLS may be interpreted as those generated by strategic players updating their strategy in a load balancing game. In closed systems, where the user population is fixed, we show that this game has pure Nash Equilibriums (NEs), and we analyze their efficiency. We further prove that when the user population grows large, pure NEs get closer to a Proportionally Fair (PF) allocation of users to servers, and we characterize the gap between equilibriums and this ideal allocation depending on user population. Under the RLS algorithm, the system converges to pure NEs: we study the time it takes for the system to reach the PF allocation within a certain margin. In open systems, where users randomly enter the system and leave upon service completion, we establish that the RLS algorithm stabilizes the system whenever this it at all possible, i.e., it is throughput-optimal.",14,[],7

But the initial formulation of MKL was only able to select the best of the features and misses out many other informative kernels presented. To overcome this, the Lp norm based formulation was proposed by Kloft et. al. This formulation is capable of choosing a non-sparse set of kernels through a control parameter p. Unfortunately, the parameter p does not have a direct meaning to the number of kernels selected. We have observed that stricter control over the number of kernels selected gives us an edge over these techniques in terms of accuracy of classification and also helps us to fine tune the algorithms to the time requirements at hand. In this work, we propose a Controlled Sparsity Kernel Learning (CSKL) formulation that can strictly control the number of kernels which we wish to select. The CSKL formulation introduces a parameter t which directly corresponds to the number of kernels selected. It is important to note that a search in t space is finite and fast as compared to p. We have also provided an efficient Reduced Gradient Descent based algorithm to solve the CSKL formulation, which is proven to converge. Through our experiments on the Caltech101 Object Categorization dataset, we have also shown that one can achieve better accuracies than the previous formulations through the right choice of t.",14,[],7
1406.1910,cs,"We define and propose a resource allocation architecture for cellular networks. The architecture combines content-aware, time-aware and location-aware resource allocation for next generation broadband wireless systems. The architecture ensures content-aware resource allocation by prioritizing real-time applications users over delay-tolerant applications users when allocating resources. It enables time-aware resource allocation via traffic-dependent pricing that varies during different hours of day (e.g. peak and off-peak traffic hours). Additionally, location-aware resource allocation is integrable in this architecture by including carrier aggregation of various frequency bands. The context-aware resource allocation is an optimal and flexible architecture that can be easily implemented in practical cellular networks. We highlight the advantages of the proposed network architecture with a discussion on the future research directions for context-aware resource allocation architecture. We also provide experimental results to illustrate a general proof of concept for this new architecture.",14,[],7
1411.4017,cs,The Kaczmarz algorithm (KA) is a popular method for solving a system of linear equations. In this note we derive a new exponential convergence result for the KA. The key allowing us to establish the new result is to rewrite the KA in such a way that its solution path can be interpreted as the output from a particular dynamical system. The asymptotic stability results of the corresponding dynamical system can then be leveraged to prove exponential convergence of the KA. The new bound is also compared to existing bounds.,14,[],7
1402.5644,cs,"Social interactions influence our thoughts, opinions and actions. In this paper, social interactions are studied within a group of individuals composed of influential social leaders and followers. Each person is assumed to maintain a social state, which can be an emotional state or an opinion. Followers update their social states based on the states of local neighbors, while social leaders maintain a constant desired state. Social interactions are modeled as a general directed graph where each directed edge represents an influence from one person to another. Motivated by the non-local property of fractional-order systems, the social response of individuals in the network are modeled by fractional-order dynamics whose states depend on influences from local neighbors and past experiences. A decentralized influence method is then developed to maintain existing social influence between individuals (i.e., without isolating peers in the group) and to influence the social group to a common desired state (i.e., within a convex hull spanned by social leaders). Mittag-Leffler stability methods are used to prove asymptotic stability of the networked fractional-order system.",14,[],7
1405.0625,cs,"Motivated by the regular service requirements of video applications for improving Quality-of-Experience (QoE) of users, we consider the design of scheduling strategies in multi-hop wireless networks that not only maximize system throughput but also provide regular inter-service times for all links. Since the service regularity of links is related to the higher-order statistics of the arrival process and the policy operation, it is highly challenging to characterize and analyze directly. We overcome this obstacle by introducing a new quantity, namely the time-since-last-service (TSLS), which tracks the time since the last service. By combining it with the queue-length in the weight, we propose a novel maximum-weight type scheduling policy, called Regular Service Guarantee (RSG) Algorithm. The unique evolution of the TSLS counter poses significant challenges for the analysis of the RSG Algorithm.   To tackle these challenges, we first propose a novel Lyapunov function to show the throughput optimality of the RSG Algorithm. Then, we prove that the RSG Algorithm can provide service regularity guarantees by using the Lyapunov-drift based analysis of the steady-state behavior of the stochastic processes. In particular, our algorithm can achieve a degree of service regularity within a factor of a fundamental lower bound we derive. This factor is a function of the system statistics and design parameters and can be as low as two in some special networks. Our results, both analytical and numerical, exhibit significant service regularity improvements over the traditional throughput-optimal policies, which reveals the importance of incorporating the metric of time-since-last-service into the scheduling policy for providing regulated service.",14,[],7

The central assumption of our work is that by combining cues from multiple languages, the structure of each becomes more apparent.

Both approaches are formulated as hierarchical Bayesian models, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques for inference. Our results demonstrate that by incorporating multilingual evidence we can achieve impressive performance gains across a range of scenarios. We also found that performance improves steadily as the number of available languages increases.",14,[],7

1405.0276,cs,"Coal blending is a critically important process in the coal mining industry as it directly influences the number of product tonnes and the total revenue generated by a mine site. Coal blending represents a challenging and complex problem with numerous blending possibilities, multiple constraints and competing objectives. At many mine sites, blending decisions are made using heuristics that have been developed through experience or made by using computer assisted control algorithms or linear programming. While current blending procedures have achieved profitable outcomes in the past, they often result in a sub-optimal utilization of high quality coal. This sub-optimality has a considerable negative impact on mine site productivity as it can reduce the amount of lower quality ROM that is blended and sold. This article reviews the coal blending problem and discusses some of the difficult trade-offs and challenges that arise in trying to address this problem. We highlight some of the risks from making simplifying assumptions and the limitations of current software optimization systems. We conclude by explaining how the mining industry would significantly benefit from research and development into optimization algorithms and technologies that are better able to combine computer optimization algorithm capabilities with the important insights of engineers and quality control specialists.",14,[],7

1412.2643,cs,"Complex environments, processes and systems may exhibit several distinct modes of physical behaviour or operation. Thus, for example, in their design, a set of mathematical models may be needed, each model having its own domain of application and representing a particular mode of behaviour or operation of physical reality. The models may be of disparate kinds  discrete or continuous in data, time and space. Furthermore, some physical modes may not have a reliable model. Physical measurements determine modes of operation. We explore the question: What is a mode of behaviour? How do we specify algorithms and software that monitor or govern a complex physical situation with many modes? How do we specify a portfolio of modes, and the computational problem of transitioning from using one mode to another mode as physical modes change? We propose a general definition of an analogue-digital system with modes. We show how any diverse set of modes  with or without models  can be bound together, and how the transitions between modes can be determined, by constructing a topological data type based upon a simplicial complex. We illustrate the ideas of physical modes and our theory by reflecting on simple examples, including driverless racing cars.",14,[],7
1408.3300,cs,"Ill-posed inverse problems are commonplace in biomedical image processing. Their solution typically requires imposing prior knowledge about the latent ground truth. While this regularizes the problem to an extent where it can be solved, it also biases the result toward the expected. With inappropriate priors harming more than they use, it remains unclear what prior to use for a given practical problem. Priors are hence mostly chosen in an \em ad hoc or empirical fashion. We argue here that the gradient distribution of natural-scene images may provide a versatile and well-founded prior for biomedical images. We provide motivation for this choice from different points of view, and we fully validate the resulting prior for use on biomedical images by showing its stability and correlation with image quality. We then provide a set of simple parametric models for the resulting prior, leading to straightforward (quasi-)convex optimization problems for which we provide efficient solver algorithms. We illustrate the use of the present models and solvers in a variety of common image-processing tasks, including contrast enhancement, noise level estimation, denoising, blind deconvolution, zooming/up-sampling, and dehazing. In all cases we show that the present method leads to results that are comparable to or better than the state of the art; always using the same, simple prior.

1401.3830,cs,"In many AI domains such as product configuration, a user should interactively specify a solution that must satisfy a set of constraints. In such scenarios, offline compilation of feasible solutions into a tractable representation is an important approach to delivering efficient backtrack-free user interaction online. In particular,binary decision diagrams (BDDs) have been successfully used as a compilation target for product and service configuration. In this paper we discuss how to extend BDD-based configuration to scenarios involving cost functions which express user preferences.   We first show that an efficient, robust and easy to implement extension is possible if the cost function is additive, and feasible solutions are represented using multi-valued decision diagrams (MDDs). We also discuss the effect on MDD size if the cost function is non-additive or if it is encoded explicitly into MDD. We then discuss interactive configuration in the presence of multiple cost functions. We prove that even in its simplest form, multiple-cost configuration is NP-hard in the input MDD. However, for solving two-cost configuration we develop a pseudo-polynomial scheme and a fully polynomial approximation scheme. The applicability of our approach is demonstrated through experiments over real-world configuration models and product-catalogue datasets.

1412.7335,cs,"We consider the problem of community detection in the Stochastic Block Model with a finite number equation of communities of sizes linearly growing with the network size equation. This model consists in a random graph such that each pair of vertices is connected independently with probability equation within communities and equation across communities.

We show that under spectral algorithms, the number of misclassified vertices does not exceed equation with high probability as equation grows large, whenever equation, equation and \beginequation* \lim\infn\to\infty n(\alpha1 p\alpha2 q-(\alpha1  \alpha2)p\frac\alpha1\alpha1  \alpha2q\frac\alpha2\alpha1  \alpha2)\over \log (\fracns) >1,\quad\quad(1) \endequation* where equation and equation denote the (fixed) proportions of vertices in the two smallest communities.

1410.4207,cs,"Since the first publication of the ""OWASP Top 10"" (2004), cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities have always been among the top 5 web application security bugs. Black-box vulnerability scanners are widely used in the industry to reproduce (XSS) attacks automatically. In spite of the technical sophistication and advancement, previous work showed that black-box scanners miss a non-negligible portion of vulnerabilities, and report non-existing, non-exploitable or uninteresting vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, these results hold true even for XSS vulnerabilities, which are relatively simple to trigger if compared, for instance, to logic flaws.   Black-box scanners have not been studied in depth on this vertical: knowing precisely how scanners try to detect XSS can provide useful insights to understand their limitations, to design better detection methods. In this paper, we present and discuss the results of a detailed and systematic study on 6 black-box web scanners (both proprietary and open source) that we conducted in coordination with the respective vendors. To this end, we developed an automated tool to (1) extract the payloads used by each scanner, (2) distill the ""templates"" that have originated each payload, (3) evaluate them according to quality indicators, and (4) perform a cross-scanner analysis. Unlike previous work, our testbed application, which contains a large set of XSS vulnerabilities, including DOM XSS, was gradually retrofitted to accomodate for the payloads that triggered no vulnerabilities.

1401.7038,gr-qc,"Many relevant applications in gravitational wave physics share a significant common problem: the seven-dimensional parameter space of gravitational waveforms from precessing compact binary inspirals and coalescences is large enough to prohibit covering the space of waveforms with sufficient density. We find that by using the reduced basis method together with a parametrization of waveforms based on their phase and precession, we can construct ultra-compact yet high-accuracy representations of this large space. As a demonstration, we show that less than equation judiciously chosen precessing inspiral waveforms are needed for equation cycles, mass ratios from equation to equation and spin magnitudes equation. In fact, using only the first equation reduced basis waveforms yields a maximum mismatch of equation over the whole range of considered parameters. We test whether the parameters selected from the inspiral regime result in an accurate reduced basis when including merger and ringdown; we find that this is indeed the case in the context of a non-precessing effective-one-body model.

1401.1506,gr-qc,"A compact object moving in curved spacetime interacts with its own gravitational field. This leads to both dissipative and conservative corrections to the motion, which can be interpreted as a self-force acting on the object. The original formalism describing this self-force relied heavily on the Green function of the linear differential operator that governs gravitational perturbations. However, because the global calculation of Green functions in non-trivial black hole spacetimes has been an open problem until recently, alternative methods were established to calculate self-force effects using sophisticated regularization techniques that avoid the computation of the global Green function. We present a method for calculating the self-force that employs the global Green function and is therefore closely modeled after the original self-force expressions. Our quantitative method involves two stages: (i) numerical approximation of the retarded Green function in the background spacetime; (ii) evaluation of convolution integrals along the worldline of the object. This novel approach can be used along arbitrary worldlines, including those currently inaccessible to more established computational techniques. Furthermore, it yields geometrical insight into the contributions to self-interaction from curved geometry (back-scattering) and trapping of null geodesics. We demonstrate the method on the motion of a scalar charge in Schwarzschild spacetime. This toy model retains the physical history-dependence of the self-force but avoids gauge issues and allows us to focus on basic principles.

We do not refute these results, but instead prove by construction that they do not necessarily lead to inconsistencies. In particular, our suggested theories are: 1. Energetically stable, i.e. their Hamiltonian is bounded from below and the multi-Minkowski metric configuration is the unique ground state. 2.

We extend the generalized Rh equation for membranes to allow the study of the effect of higher order curvature terms in the action on the issue of cusps and kinks, using it as a tool for determining when a Nambu-Goto string generates cusps or kinks in its evolution.

1406.0483,gr-qc,"A modified semi-classical method is used to construct both ground and excited state solutions to the canonically quantized vacuum Bianchi IX (Mixmaster) cosmological models. Employing a modified form of the semi-classical Ansatz we solve the relevant Wheeler-DeWitt equation asymptotically by integrating a set of linear transport equations along the flow of a suitably chosen solution to the corresponding Euclidean-signature Hamilton-Jacobi equation. For the Moncrief-Ryan (or `wormhole') Hamilton-Jacobi solution, we compute the ground state quantum correction term associated with operator ordering ambiguities and show how higher order correction terms can be computed. We also determine the explicit, leading order forms of a family of excited states and show how to compute their quantum corrections as smooth, globally defined functions on the Bianchi IX minisuperspace. These excited-state solutions are peaked away from the minisuperspace origin and are labeled by a pair of positive integers that can be plausibly interpreted as graviton excitation numbers for the two independent anisotropy degrees of freedom.

1411.0598,gr-qc,"With the advance in computational resources, Bayesian inference is increasingly becoming the standard tool of practise in GW astronomy. However, algorithms such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) require a large number of iterations to guarantee convergence to the target density. Each chain demands a large number of evaluations of the likelihood function, and in the case of a Hessian MCMC, calculations of the Fisher information matrix for use as a proposal distribution. As each iteration requires the generation of at least one gravitational waveform, we very quickly reach a point of exclusion for current Bayesian algorithms, especially for low mass systems where the length of the waveforms is large and the waveform generation time is on the order of seconds. This suddenly demands a timescale of many weeks for a single MCMC. As each likelihood and Fisher information matrix calculation requires the evaluation of noise-weighted scalar products, we demonstrate that by using the linearity of integration, and the fact that more than 90% of the generation time is spent at frequencies less that one third of the maximum, we can construct composite integrals that speed up the MCMCs for comparable mass binaries by a factor of between 3.5 and 5.5, depending on the waveform length. This method is both source and detector type independent, and can be applied to any waveform that displays significant frequency evolution, such as stellar mass binaries with Advanced LIGO/Virgo, as well as supermassive black holes with eLISA",14,[],13

Finally the thermal equation of state is discussed which is an explicit function of temperature only. It is also observed that the third law of thermodynamics is satisfied in this model.

We also argue that the ordinary thermal radiation can be taken as a signal for the existence of some kind of ""confined"" bulk degrees of freedom which prevent a gravitational system from collapse.

Another issue is that GR needs dark energy to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe, while acceleration of receding masses is inherent to the Machian principle.

1405.2146,gr-qc,"An alternative inflationary model is proposed predicated upon a consideration of the form of the uncertainty principle in a curved background spacetime. An argument is presented suggesting a possible curvature dependence in the correct commutator relations for a quantum field in a classical background which cannot be deduced by simply extrapolation from the flat spacetime theory. To assess the possible consequences of this dependence, we apply the idea to a scalar field in a closed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background, using a simple model for the curvature dependence (along the way, a previous result obtained by Bunch (1980) for the adiabatically expanded wave function is corrected). The result is a time-dependent cosmological constant, producing a vast amount of inflation that is independent of the mass of the matter field or its effective potential. Furthermore, it is seen that the field modes are initially zero for all wavelengths and come into being as the universe evolves. In this sense, the universe creates its contents out of its own expansion. At the end of the process, the matter field is far from equilibrium and essentially reproduces the initial conditions for the New Inflationary Model.",14,[],13

In this work we sketch the basics for the analysis of the second order problem using the modern theory of perturbed matchings. In particular, the result we present is that when the energy density of the fluid in the static configuration does not vanish at the boundary, one of the functions of the second order perturbation in the setting of the original work by Hartle is not continuous.

This allows to introduce its minisuperspace formulation where the vector fields are constant everywhere on equation with exception of a measure zero set (the piecewise constant fields). The fields are parameterized by their constant values \it independently chosen in, e. g., the 4-simplices or, say, parallelepipeds into which equation can be decomposed.

However, the alternative formulation of classical General Relativity known as Shape Dynamics suggest that a subset of spacetime diffeomorphisms - namely hypersurface deformations - are, in a certain sense, dual to spatial conformal (or Weyl) invariance. Moreover, holographic gauge/gravity dualities suggest that bulk spacetime diffeomorphism invariance can be replaced by the properties of boundary CFTs. How can these new frameworks be compatible with the traditional notion of reference frame so fundamental to our interpretation of General Relativity?

In this case, the black hole is surrounded in a spherical cavity with a fixed temperature on the surface. It is observed that these black holes have a phase transition similar to the liquid-gas phase transition of a Van der Waals fluid. Also, by treating the cosmological constant equation as a thermodynamic pressure equation, we study the thermodynamic behavior of charged anti-de Sitter black holes in an ensemble with a pressure of equation and an electric potential equation as the natural variables.

We reconstruct equation model with the inclusion of HDE and three well-known forms of the scale factor equation, i.e. the emergent, the logamediate and the intermediate scale factors.

1403.7275,gr-qc,"In a previous paper, the author introduced a covariant causet (equation-causet) approach to discrete quantum gravity. A equation-causet is a finite partially ordered set that is invariant under labeling. The invariant labeling of a equation-causet equation enables us to uniquely specify equation by a sequence equation, equation, of positive integers called a shell sequence of equation. A equation-causet equation describes the microscopic structure of a possible universe at a particular time step. In general, equation represents one of many universes in a multiverse and equation grows by a single element at each time step. Since early stages of a universe were probably composed of elementary particles, we propose that elementary particles can be described by simple equation-causets. Although we do not have a rigorous theory for such a description, we present our guess as to how it might appear. The shell sequence can be applied to find theoretical masses of particles and these seem to approximately agree with known masses. We point out that the causal order provides a unification of the strong and weak forces for elementary particles and also determines the geometry of equation-causets which describes gravity. Moreover, it appears that some particles correspond to dark matter-energy.",14,[],13
1410.0597,gr-qc,"Likelihood surfaces in the parameter space of gravitational wave signals can contain many secondary maxima, which can prevent search algorithms from finding the global peak and correctly mapping the distribution. Traditional schemes to mitigate this problem maintain the number of secondary maxima and thus retain the possibility that the global maximum will remain undiscovered. By contrast, the recently proposed technique of likelihood transform can modify the structure of the likelihood surface to reduce its complexity. We present a practical method to carry out a likelihood transform using a Gaussian smoothing kernel, utilising gravitational wave surrogate models to perform the smoothing operation analytically. We demonstrate the approach with Newtonian and post-Newtonian waveform models for an inspiralling circular compact binary.",14,[],13
1411.3073,gr-qc,"We derive the scalar waveform generated by a binary of nonspinning compact objects (black holes or neutron stars) in a general class of scalar-tensor theories of gravity. The waveform is accurate to 1.5 post-Newtonian order [equation] beyond the leading-order tensor gravitational waves (the ""Newtonian quadrupole""). To solve the scalar-tensor field equations, we adapt the direct integration of the relaxed Einstein equations formalism developed by Will, Wiseman, and Pati. The internal gravity of the compact objects is treated with an approach developed by Eardley. We find that the scalar waves are described by the same small set of parameters which describes the equations of motion and tensor waves. For black hole--black hole binaries, the scalar waveform vanishes, as expected from previous results which show that these systems in scalar-tensor theory are indistinguishable from their general relativistic counterparts. For black hole--neutron star binaries, the scalar waveform simplifies considerably from the generic case, essentially depending on only a single parameter up to first post-Newtonian order. With both the tensor and scalar waveforms in hand, we calculate the total energy flux carried by the outgoing waves. This quantity is computed to first post-Newtonian order relative to the ""quadrupole formula"" and agrees with previous, lower order calculations.",14,[],13

We resolve the apparent conflict between the Lorentz-Dirac equation and Larmor's formula of radiation by noting that the former describes an electron that is itself accelerated by an electromagnetic field. If instead, a hypothetical particle is considered that is accelerated by a non-electromagnetic force, Larmor's formula is found to be consistent with the accelerating particle's equation of motion. We consider the consequences concerning the equivalence principle and find that it is indeed violated if one demands that the same electromagnetic field be present in both the gravitational and accelerating cases; however, if one allows for the external electromagnetic fields to be different, the validity of the equivalence principle is restored. In either case, the basic idea behind the equivalence principle, which leads to a geometrized theory of gravity, remains unaffected.",14,[],13
1412.7899,gr-qc,"We reconsider some fundamental problems of the thin shell model. First, we point out that the ""cut and paste"" construction does not guarantee a well-defined manifold because there is no overlap of coordinates across the shell. When one requires that the spacetime metric across the thin shell is continuous, it also provides a way to specify the tangent space and the manifold. Other authors have shown that this specification leads to the conservation laws when shells collide. On the other hand, the well-known areal radius equation seems to be a perfect coordinate covering all regions of a spherically symmetric spacetime. However, we show by simple but rigorous arguments that equation fails to be a coordinate covering a neighborhood of the thin shell if the metric across the shell is continuous. When two spherical shells collide and merge into one, we show that it is possible that equation remains to be a good coordinate and the conservation laws hold. To make this happen, different spacetime regions divided by the shells must be glued in a specific way such that some constraints are satisfied. We compare our new construction with the old one by solving constraints numerically.",14,[],13
1402.4557,gr-qc,"In this paper we consider the occupation number of induced quasi-particles produced during a time-dependent process using three-different methods: Instantaneous diagonalization, Bogolyubov transformation between two different vacua, and the Unruh-de Witt detector. Here we consider the Hamiltonian for a time-dependent Harmonic oscillator, with time-dependent mass and frequency. We derive the occupation number of the induced quasi-particles using the invariant operator method; in deriving the occupation number we also point out and make the connection between the Functional Schrodinger formalism, quantum kinetic equation, and Bogolyubov transformation between two different Fock space basis at equal times and explain the role in which the invariant operator plays. Using the flat FRW chart of de Sitter spacetime, we show that the different methods lead to different results: Instantaneous diagonalization leads to a power law distribution, while the Bogolyubov transformation and Unruh-de Witt detector both lead to thermal distributions. It is shown that the source of the discrepancy between the instantaneous diagonalization and Bogolyubov methods is the fact that there is no notion of well-defined particles in the out vacuum due to a divergent term. In the Bogolyubov method, this divergent term cancels leading to the thermal distribution, while in the instantaneous diagonalization there is no such cancelation. However, to obtain the thermal distribution in the usual Bogolyubov method, one must use the large mass limit. On physical grounds, one should expect that only the modes which have been allowed to sample the horizon would be thermal, thus in the large mass limit these modes are well within the horizon and, even though they do grow, they remain well within the horizon due to the mass. Thus one should not expect a thermal distribution since the modes won't have a chance to thermalize.",14,[],13
1403.7754,gr-qc,"In dense stellar regions, highly eccentric binaries of black holes and neutron stars can form through various n-body interactions. Such a binary could emit a significant fraction of its binding energy in a sequence of largely isolated gravitational wave bursts prior to merger. Given expected black hole and neutron star masses, many such systems will emit these repeated bursts at frequencies within the sensitive band of contemporary ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Unfortunately, existing gravitational wave searches are ill-suited to detect these signals. In this work, we adapt a ""power stacking"" method to the detection of gravitational wave signals from highly eccentric binaries. We implement this method as an extension of the Q-transform, a projection onto a multiresolution basis of windowed complex exponentials that has previously been used to analyze data from the network of LIGO/Virgo detectors. Our method searches for excess power over an ensemble of time-frequency tiles. We characterize the performance of our method using Monte Carlo experiments with signals injected in simulated detector noise. Our results indicate that the power stacking method achieves substantially better sensitivity to eccentric binary signals than existing localized burst searches.",14,[],13
1405.2277,gr-qc,"The building of a time machine, if possible at all, requires the relevant regions of spacetime to be compact (that is, physically speaking, free from sources of unpredictability such as infinities and singularities). Motivated by this argument we consider the spacetimes with the compactly determined Cauchy horizons (CDCHs), the defining property of which is the compactness of equation, where equation is an open subset of the Cauchy horizon and equation is a Cauchy surface of the initial globally hyperbolic region equation. The following two facts are established: 1) equation has no globally hyperbolic maximal extension. This means that by shaping appropriately a precompact portion of a globally hyperbolic region one can \emphforce the Universe to produce either a closed causal curve, or a quasiregular singularity, whichever it abhors less; 2) Before a CDCH is formed a null geodesic appears which infinitely approaches the horizon returning again and again in the same --- arbitrarily small --- region. The energy of the photon moving on such a geodesic increases with each passage, or at least falls insufficiently fast. As a result, an observer located in the mentioned region would see a bunch of photons passing through his laboratory with the arbitrarily large total energy.

The Weyl curvature tensor equation vanishes in the FLRW spacetime satisfying the Penrose zero Weyl curvature conjecture. The requirement of a measure of gravitational entropy is discussed. The vacuum expectation value equation for a vector field equation acts as an order parameter and at the critical temperature equation a phase transition occurs breaking the Lorentz symmetry spontaneously.

This covers A) the more familiar issue of topology change in the sense of topological manifolds (tied to cobordisms), including via pinched manifolds. B) The less familiar issue of not regarding as fixed the yet deeper levels of structure: topological spaces themselves (and their metric space subcase), collections of subsets and sets.

The extinction model studied in this analysis is motivated by the search for signatures of strong gravity at the TeV scale (terascale gravity) and assumes the existence of string couplings in the strong-coupling limit. In this limit, the string model predicts the suppression of all high-transverse-momentum standard model processes, including jet production, beyond a certain energy scale. To test this prediction, the measured transverse-momentum spectrum is compared to the theoretical prediction of the standard model. No significant deficit of events is found at high transverse momentum. A 95% confidence level lower limit of 3.3 TeV is set on the extinction mass scale.",14,[],12

We find that the Majorana phases play an important role in the RGE running of these mixing patterns along with the seesaw threshold corrections. We present a comparative study of the RGE of all these mixing scenarios both with and without Majorana CP phases when seesaw threshold corrections are taken into consideration. We find that in the absence of these Majorana phases both the RGE running and seesaw effects may lead to equation 5equation at low energies both in the SM and MSSM. However, if the Majorana phases are incorporated to the mixing matrix the running can be enhanced both in the SM and MSSM.

They are therefore a natural tool for the study of hadron collisions.   This paper introduces the use of wavelets for de-noising (removal of soft activity), studying the scaling behaviour of a shower, and recognising jets according to this behaviour. This is demonstrated by processing a sample of boosted W boson Monte Carlo events together with their QCD background. The method is quite general and can be used as a pre-processing step in conjunction with any jet-finder or other event-shape algorithm.

All the scalars have, with respect to the weak and the hyper charge, the quantum numbers of the \it standard model scalar Higgs: equation and equation, respectively.

It is found that the linear sigma model with only a single lowest-lying nonet is not accurate in predicting the decay width, but inclusion of the mixing of this nonet with the next-to-lowest lying nonet, together with the effect of final state interaction of pions, significantly improves this prediction and agrees with experiment up to about 1\%. It is also shown that while the prediction of the leading order of the generalized model for the Dalitz parameters is not close to the experiment, the model is able to give a reasonable prediction of the energy dependencies of the normalized decay amplitude squared and that this is expected to improve with further refinement of the complicated underlying mixings.

1404.0392,hep-ph,"We study the spin-independent neutralino Dark Matter scattering off heavy nuclei in the MSSM. We identify analytically the blind spots in direct detection for intermediate values of equation. In the region where equation and equation have opposite signs, there is not only a reduction of the lightest CP-even Higgs coupling to neutralinos, but also a destructive interference between the neutralino scattering through the exchange of the lightest CP-even Higgs and that through the exchange of the heaviest CP-even Higgs. At critical values of equation, the tree-level contribution from the light Higgs exchange cancels the contribution from the heavy Higgs, so the scattering cross section vanishes. We denote these configurations as blind spots, since they provide a generalization of the ones previously discussed in the literature, which occur at very large values of equation. We show that the generalized blind spots may occur in regions of parameter space that are consistent with the obtention of the proper neutralino relic density, and can be tested by non-standard Higgs boson searches and EWino searches at the LHC and future linear colliders.",14,[],2

We compute this frequency-dependent index of refraction for such a medium and use the frequency-dependent arrival time of light from astrophysical sources to constrain the properties of dark atoms in the medium. Using optical-wavelength observations from the Crab Pulsar, we find the electric millicharge of dark (electrons) protons to be smaller than the electric charge equation for dark atom masses below 100 keV, assuming a dark fine structure constant equation.

1409.7392,hep-ph,"In a large class of models for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), the WIMP mass equation lies far above the weak scale equation. This work identifies universal Sudakov-type logarithms equation that spoil the naive convergence of perturbation theory for annihilation processes. An effective field theory (EFT) framework is presented, allowing the systematic resummation of these logarithms. Another impact of the large separation of scales is that a long-distance wave-function distortion from electroweak boson exchange leads to observable modifications of the cross section. Careful accounting of momentum regions in the EFT allows the rigorously disentanglement of this so-called Sommerfeld enhancement from the short distance hard annihilation process. The WIMP is modeled as a heavy-particle field, while the light, energetic, final-state electroweak gauge bosons are treated as soft and collinear fields. Hard matching coefficients are computed at renormalization scale equation, then evolved down to equation, where electroweak symmetry breaking is incorporated and the matching onto the relevant quantum mechanical Hamiltonian is performed. The example of an equation triplet scalar dark matter candidate annihilating to line photons is used for concreteness, allowing the numerical exploration of the impact of next-to-leading order corrections and log resummation.

Right-handed and the equation sterile neutrinos allow the implementation of a 8x8 general Majorana neutrino mass matrix with four or five massless neutrinos at tree level. Hence, light fermions, including light neutrinos get masses from radiative corrections mediated by the massive SU(3) gauge bosons. We report the corresponding Majorana neutrino mass matrix up to one loop.

Some of these integrals can not be solved exactly and people are forced to use approximate methods which seems not to give sufficient and precise results. On the other hand on analysing the TMC effect we encounter with the threshold problem for nucleon structure which results to have the structure function in a regions which are physically forbidden. Here we render a new solution way, based on the re-scaled parton densities to resolve the difficultly, relating to the TMC effect. Our solution way can be employed directly and easily to the parton distribution rather than to the nucleon structure function. There are different options to amend the parton densities. What we call as third re-scaling is the best one. Using it we are able to discard the threshold problem for the nucleon structure function without resorting to apply some auxiliary mathematical tools like the step function which is plausible by people .

1410.1742,hep-ph,"Symmetry transformations have been proven a bedrock tool for understanding the nature of particle interactions, formulating and testing fundamental theories. Based on the up to now unbroken CPT symmetry, the violation of the CP symmetry between matter and antimatter by weak interactions, discovered in the decay of kaons in 1964 and observed more recently in 2001 in B mesons, strongly suggests that the behavior of these particles under weak interactions must also be asymmetric under time reversal T. However, until the recent years there has not been a direct detection of the expected time-reversal violation in the time evolution of any system. This Colloquium examines the field of time-reversal symmetry breaking in the fundamental laws of physics. For transitions, its observation requires an asymmetry with exchange of initial and final states. We discuss the conceptual basis for such an exchange with unstable particles, using the quantum properties of Einstein Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entanglement available at B meson factories combined with the decay as a filtering measurement. The method allows a clear-cut separation of different transitions between flavor and CP eigenstates in the decay of neutral B mesons.

1412.8506,hep-th,"We study statistical properties of states of massive quantized charged Dirac and Klein-Gordon fields interacting with a background that violates the vacuum stability, first in general terms and then for a special electromagnetic background. As a starting point, we use a nonperturbative expression for the density operators of such fields derived by Gavrilov et al [S.P. Gavrilov, D.M. Gitman, and J.L. Tomazelli, Nucl. Phys. B 795, 645 (2008)]. We construct the reduced density operators for electron and positron subsystems and discuss a decoherence that may occur in the course of the evolution due to an intermediate measurement. By calculating the entropy we study the loss of the information in QED states due to partial reductions and a possible decoherence. Next, we consider the so-called T-constant external electric field as an external background. This exactly solvable example allows us to calculate explicitly all statistical properties of various quantum states of the massive charged fields under consideration.",14,[],4

1401.5189,hep-th,"We study the differentiability of the metric and other fields at any of the horizons of multi center Reissner-Nordstrom black hole solutions in equation and of multi center equation brane solutions. The centers are distributed in a plane in transverse space, hence termed coplanar. We construct the Gaussian null co-ordinate system for the neighborhood of a horizon by solving the geodesic equations in expansions of (appropriate powers of) the affine parameter. Organizing the harmonic functions that appear in the solution in terms of what can be called generalized Gegenbauer polynomials is key to obtaining the solution to the geodesic equations in a compact and manageable form. We then compute the metric and other fields in the Gaussian null co-ordinate system and find that the differentiability of the coplanar solution is \emphidentical to the differentiability of the collinear solution (centers distributed on a line in transverse space). The results of this paper thus run counter to a suggestion in the literature that posits reduction in the degree of smoothness to accompany reduction in symmetries. We end the paper with a conjecture on the degree of smoothness of the most general multi center solution, the one with centers distributed arbitrarily and hence possessing no transverse spatial isometries.",14,[],4

Particular emphasis is placed on U(1)s which become massive through the geometric Stuckelberg mechanism in type IIB. We present a proposal on how to take such geometrically massive U(1)s and the associated fluxes into account in the Kaluza-Klein reduction of F-theory with the help of non-harmonic forms. Evidence for this proposal is obtained by working out the F-theory effective action including such non-harmonic forms and matching the results with the known type IIB expressions. We furthermore discuss how world-volume fluxes on D3-brane instantons affect the instanton charge with respect to U(1) gauge symmetries and the chiral zero mode spectrum. The classical partition function of M5-instantons in F-theory is discussed and compared with the type IIB results for D3-brane instantons. The type IIB match allows us to determine the correct M5 partition function. Selection rules for the absence of chiral charged zero modes on M5-instantons in backgrounds with G4 flux are discussed and compared with the type IIB results. The dimensional reduction of the democratic formulation of M-theory is presented in the appendix. This article is based on the author's PhD thesis but includes minor modifications.,14,[],4

The geometry, as expected, is holographic, with equation spacetime emerging correspondent with RG fixed points. The field theory construction gives us a particular vector bundle over the equation-dimensional RG mapping space, called a jet bundle, whose structure group arises from the linear orthogonal bi-local transformations of the bare fields in the path integral. The sources for quadratic operators constitute a connection on this bundle and a section of its endomorphism bundle. Recasting the geometry in terms of the corresponding principal bundle, we arrive at a structure remarkably similar to the Vasiliev theory, where the horizontal part of the connection on the principal bundle is Vasiliev's higher spin connection, while the vertical part (the Faddeev-Popov ghost) corresponds to the equation-field. The Vasiliev equations are then, respectively, the RG equations and the BRST equations, with the RG beta functions encoding bulk interactions. Finally, we remark that a large class of interacting field theories can be studied through integral transforms of our results, and it is natural to organize this in terms of a large equation expansion.",14,[],4

In a mixed canonical grand canonical ensemble with a fixed electric charge and varying magnetic charge these black holes exhibit liquid gas like first order phase transition culminating in a second order critical point similar to the Van der Waals gas. We show that the thermodynamic scalar curvature R for these black holes follow our proposed geometrical characterization of the R-crossing Method for the first order liquid gas like phase transition and exhibits a divergence at the second order critical point. The pattern of R crossing and divergence exactly corresponds to those of a Van der Waals gas described by us in an earlier work.,14,[],4

1405.6350,hep-th,"In this letter we consider the collinear limit of gluon scattering amplitudes in planar N=4 SYM theory at strong coupling. We argue that in this limit scattering amplitudes map into correlators of twist fields in the two dimensional non-linear O(6) sigma model, similar to those appearing in recent studies of entanglement entropy. We provide evidence for this assertion by combining the intuition springing from the string worldsheet picture and the predictions coming from the OPE series. One of the main implications of these considerations is that scattering amplitudes receive equally important contributions at strong coupling from both the minimal string area and its fluctuations in the sphere.",14,[],4
1409.4417,hep-th,"We introduce a new quantum mechanical theory called Spin Matrix theory (SMT). The theory is interacting with a single coupling constant g and is based on a Hilbert space of harmonic oscillators with a spin index taking values in a Lie (super)algebra representation as well as matrix indices for the adjoint representation of U(N). We show that SMT describes N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory (SYM) near zero-temperature critical points in the grand canonical phase diagram. Equivalently, SMT arises from non-relativistic limits of N=4 SYM. Even though SMT is a non-relativistic quantum mechanical theory it contains a variety of phases mimicking the AdS/CFT correspondence. Moreover, the infinite g limit of SMT can be mapped to the supersymmetric sector of string theory on AdS5 x S5. We study SU(2) SMT in detail. At large N and low temperatures it is a theory of spin chains that for small g resembles planar gauge theory and for large g a non-relativistic string theory. When raising the temperature a partial deconfinement transition occurs due to finite-N effects. For sufficiently high temperatures the partially deconfined phase has a classical regime. We find a matrix model description of this regime at any coupling g. Setting g=0 it is a theory of N21 harmonic oscillators while for large g it becomes 2N harmonic oscillators.",14,[],4

In addition, the implications of the VSR-modified Lorentz symmetry on the spectrum of a hydrogen atom are determined by calculating the first-order energy corrections in the context of standard quantum mechanics.

Alternatively, the solutions can be viewed as vacua of maximally supersymmetric supergravity in six dimensions with a set of scalar fields varying holomorphically over equation. For a class of solutions characterised by up to five holomorphic functions, we outline how the local solutions can be completed to four-dimensional flux vacua of type IIB theory. A detailed study of this global completion for solutions with two holomorphic functions has been carried out in the companion paper [1].

When the base has orbifold singularities, we find that the anomaly polynomial of the 6D SCFTs can be understood purely in terms of the intersection theory of fractional divisors: the anomaly coefficient vectors are identified with elements of the orbifold homology. This also explains why in certain cases, the SCFT can appear to contribute a ""fraction of a hypermultiplet"" to the anomaly polynomial. Quantization of the lattice of string charges also predicts the existence of additional light states beyond those captured by such fractional divisors.

Moreover, SH(M) is obtained from QH(M) by localizing at the toric divisors. We give explicit presentations of SH(M) and QH(M), using ideas of Batyrev, McDuff and Tolman. Assuming that the superpotential is Morse (or a milder semisimplicity assumption), we prove that the wrapped Fukaya category for this class of manifolds satisfies the toric generation criterion, i.e. is split-generated by the natural Lagrangian torus fibres of the moment map with suitable holonomies. In particular, the wrapped category is compactly generated and cohomologically finite. The proof uses a deformation argument, via a generic generation theorem and an argument about continuity of eigenspaces.

1408.3248,math,"We consider the problem of performing ranging measurements between a source and multiple receivers efficiently and accurately, as required by distance-based wireless localization systems. To this end, a new multipoint ranging algorithm is proposed, which is obtained by adapting superresolution techniques to the ranging problem, using for the sake of illustration the specific cases of ToA and PDoA, unified under the same mathematical framework. The algorithm handles multipoint ranging in an efficient manner by employing an orthogonalized non-uniform sampling scheme optimised via Golomb rulers. Since the approach requires the design of mutually orthogonal sets of Golomb rulers with equivalent properties -- a problem that founds no solution in current literature -- a new genetic algorithm to accomplish this task is presented, which is also found to outperform the best known alternative when used to generate a single ruler. Finally, a CRLB analysis of the overall optimised multipoint ranging solution is performed, which together with a comparison against simulation results validates the proposed techniques.",14,[],0

This recursion provides explicit enumerations of sequences of gaps among the generators, which are known as constellations.   As the recursion proceeds, adjacent gaps within longer constellations are added together to produce shorter constellations of the same sum. These additions or closures correspond to removing composite numbers that are divisible by the prime for that stage of Eratosthenes sieve. Although we don't know where in the cycle of gaps a closure will occur, we can enumerate exactly how many copies of various constellations will survive each stage.   In this paper, we broaden our study of these systems of constellations of a fixed sum. By generalizing our methods, we are able to demonstrate that for every even number equation the gap equation occurs infinitely often through the stages of Eratosthenes sieve.

1401.1377,math,"A finite or infinite matrix A with rational entries is called partition regular if whenever the natural numbers are finitely coloured there is a monochromatic vector x with Ax=0. Many of the classical theorems of Ramsey Theory may naturally be interpreted as assertions that particular matrices are partition regular. In the finite case, Rado proved that a matrix is partition regular if and only it satisfies a computable condition known as the columns property. The first requirement of the columns property is that some set of columns sums to zero.   In the infinite case, much less is known. There are many examples of matrices with the columns property that are not partition regular, but until now all known examples of partition regular matrices did have the columns property. Our main aim in this paper is to show that, perhaps surprisingly, there are infinite partition regular matrices without the columns property --- in fact, having no set of columns summing to zero.

1406.3972,math,"This paper builds on the notion of the so-called orthogonal derivative, where an n-th order derivative is approximated by an integral involving an orthogonal polynomial of degree n. This notion was reviewed in great detail in a paper in J. Approx. Theory (2012) by the author and Koornwinder. Here an approximation of the Weyl or Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative is considered by replacing the n-th derivative by its approximation in the formula for the fractional derivative. In the case of, for instance, Jacobi polynomials an explicit formula for the kernel of this approximate fractional derivative can be given. Next we consider the fractional derivative as a filter and compute the transfer function in the continuous case for the Jacobi polynomials and in the discrete case for the Hahn polynomials. The transfer function in the Jacobi case is a confluent hypergeometric function. A different approach is discussed which starts with this explicit transfer function and then obtains the approximate fractional derivative by taking the inverse Fourier transform. The theory is finally illustrated with an application of a fractional differentiating filter. In particular, graphs are presented of the absolute value of the modulus of the transfer function. These make clear that for a good insight in the behavior of a fractional differentiating filter one has to look for the modulus of its transfer function in a log-log plot, rather than for plots in the time domain.",14,[],0

1403.7719,nlin,In this paper we briefly report some recent developments on generalized synchronization. We discuss different methods of detecting generalized synchronization. We first consider two unidirectionally coupled systems and then two mutually coupled systems. We then extend the study to a network of coupled systems. In the study of generalized synchronization of coupled nonidentical systems we discuss the Master Stability Function (MSF) formalism for coupled nearly identical systems. Later we use this MSF to construct synchronized optimized networks. In the optimized networks the nodes which have parameter value at one extreme are chosen as hubs and the pair of nodes with larger difference in parameter are chosen to create links.,14,[],9

1403.3456,nlin,"We investigate the synchronization behavior of a system of globally coupled, continuous-time oscillators possessing robust chaos. The local dynamics corresponds to the Shimizu-Morioka model where the occurrence of robust chaos in a region of its parameter space has been recently discovered. We show that the global coupling can drive the oscillators to synchronization into a fixed point created by the coupling, resulting in amplitude death in the system. The existence of robust chaos allows to introduce heterogeneity in the local parameters, while guaranteeing the functioning of all the oscillators in a chaotic mode. In this case, the system reaches a state of oscillation death, with coexisting clusters of oscillators in different steady states. The phenomena of amplitude death or oscillation death in coupled robust-chaos flows could be employed as mechanisms for stabilization and control in systems that require reliable operation under chaos.",14,[],9

By means of extensive numerical experiments, it is shown that these perturbations are isentropic (at least approximately). In other words, the dynamical entropy does not fluctuate, while local jumps in letter and L are significant.",14,[],9
1408.4905,nlin,"This paper presents the dynamics of a practical equivalent of a smooth memristor oscillator derived from Chua's circuit.

The amplitude and the frequency of the oscillations are previously defined in the circuit design. The result is a robust and flexible circuit without inductors, which is able to reproduce a rich variety of dynamical behaviors.

1406.4344,nlin,"We study the dynamics of inertial particles in three dimensional incompressible maps, as representations of volume preserving flows. The impurity dynamics has been modeled, in the Lagrangian framework, by a six-dimensional dissipative bailout embedding map. The fluid-parcel dynamics of the base map is embedded in the particle dynamics governed by the map. The base map considered for the present study is the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress (ABC) map. We consider the behavior of the system both in the aerosol regime, where the density of the particle is larger than that of the base flow, as well as the bubble regime, where the particle density is less than that of the base flow. The phase spaces in both the regimes show rich and complex dynamics with three type of dynamical behaviors - chaotic structures, regular orbits and hyperchaotic regions. In the one-action case, the aerosol regime is found to have periodic attractors for certain values of the dissipation and inertia parameters. For the aerosol regime of the two-action ABC map, an attractor merging and widening crises is identified using the bifurcation diagram and the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents. After the crisis an attractor with two parts is seen, and trajectories hop between these parts with period 2. The bubble regime of the embedded map shows strong hyperchaotic regions as well as crisis induced intermittency with characteristic times between bursts that scale as a power law behavior as a function of the dissipation parameter. Furthermore, we observe riddled basin of attraction and unstable dimension variability in the phase space in the bubble regime. The bubble regime in one-action shows similar behavior. This study of a simple model of impurity dynamics may shed light upon the transport properties of passive scalars in three dimensional flows. We also compare our results with those seen earlier in two dimensional flows.",14,[],9
1406.6630,nlin,"Harmonically modulated complex solitary waves which are a generalized type of envelope soliton (herein coined oscillatory solitons) are studied for the two U(1)-invariant integrable generalizations of the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation, given by the Hirota equation and the Sasa-Satsuma equation. A bilinear formulation of these two equations is used to derive the oscillatory 1-soliton and 2-soliton solutions, which are then written out in a physical form parameterized in terms of their speed, modulation frequency, and phase. Depending on the modulation frequency, the speeds of oscillatory waves (1-solitons) can be positive, negative, or zero, in contrast to the strictly positive speed of ordinary solitons. When the speed is zero, an oscillatory wave is a time-periodic standing wave. Properties of the amplitude and phase of oscillatory 1-solitons are derived. Oscillatory 2-solitons are graphically illustrated to describe collisions between two oscillatory 1-solitons in the case when the speeds are distinct. In the special case of equal speeds, oscillatory 2-solitons are shown to reduce to harmonically modulated breather waves.",14,[],9

Employing continuation techniques the bifurcation structure is numerically investigated employing the non-dimensional transfer velocity as the main control parameter. It is found that the snaking structure of steady fronts states is intertwined with a large number of branches of time-periodic solutions that emerge from Hopf or period doubling bifurcations and end in global bifurcations (sniper and homoclinic). Overall the bifurcation diagram has a harp-like appearance. This is complemented by a two-parameter study (in non-dimensional transfer velocity and domain size) that elucidates through which local and global codimension 2 bifurcations the entire harp-like structure emerges.",14,[],9

As a function of two experimental parameters, the doublet and also the associated eigenvectors could be tuned to coalesce at a so-called exceptional point (EP). The behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors when encircling the EP in parameter space was studied, including the geometric amplitude that builds up in the case of broken TRI. A one-dimensional subspace of parameters was found where the differences of the eigenvalues are either real or purely imaginary.

1407.2513,nlin,Generic Hamiltonian systems have a mixed phase space where regions of regular and chaotic motion coexist. We present a method for constructing an integrable approximation to such regular phase-space regions including a nonlinear resonance chain. This approach generalizes the recently introduced iterative canonical transformation method. In the first step of the method a normal-form Hamiltonian with a resonance chain is adapted such that actions and frequencies match with those of the non-integrable system. In the second step a sequence of canonical transformations is applied to the integrable approximation to match the shape of regular tori. We demonstrate the method for the generic standard map at various parameters.,14,[],9

The system is formalized in terms of a multilayer network, where the top layer is made of disconnected oscillators and the bottom one, modeling the medium, consists of oscillators coupled according to a given topology. The different dynamics of the medium and the top layer is accounted by including a frequency mismatch between them. We show a novel regime of synchronization as intra-layer coherence does not necessarily require inter-layer coherence. This regime appears under mild conditions on the bottom layer: arbitrary topologies may be considered, provided that they support synchronization of the oscillators of the medium. The existence of a density-dependent threshold as in quorum-sensing phenomena is also demonstrated.",14,[],9

We demonstrate that in the nonlinear stage of the MI the moments of the solutions amplitudes oscillate with time around their asymptotic values very similar to sinusoidal law. The amplitudes of these oscillations decay with time equation as equation, the phases contain the nonlinear phase shift that decays as equation, and the period of the oscillations is equal to equation. The asymptotic values of the moments correspond to Rayleigh probability density function (PDF) of waves amplitudes appearance. We show that such behavior of the moments is governed by oscillatory-like, decaying with time, fluctuations of the PDF around the Rayleigh PDF; the time dependence of the PDF turns out to be very similar to that of the moments.

1411.0513,nlin,"A wealth of observations, recently supported by rigorous analysis, indicate that, asymptotically in time, most multi-soliton solutions of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili II equation self-organize in webs comprised of solitons and soliton-junctions. Junctions are connected in pairs, each pair - by a single soliton. The webs expand in time. As distances between junctions grow, the memory of the structure of junctions in a connected pair ceases to affect the structure of either junction. As a result, every junction propagates at a constant velocity, which is determined by the wave numbers that go into its construction. One immediate consequence of this characteristic is that asymptotic webs preserve their morphology as they expand in time. Another consequence, based on simple geometric considerations, explains why, except in special cases, only 3-junctions (Y-shaped, involving three wave numbers) and 4-junctions (X-shaped, involving four wave numbers) can par-take in the construction of an asymptotic soliton web.",14,[],9

Our main finding is that the breather of the sine-Gordon model will only persist at the interface between gain and loss that equation-symmetry imposes but will not be preserved if centered at the lossy or at the gain side. The latter dynamics is found to be interesting in its own right giving rise to kink-antikink pairs on the gain side and complete decay of the breather on the lossy side.

1402.5873,nlin,"The mechanism of randomization in late boundary layer transition is a key issue of late boundary layer transition and turbulence theory. We studied the mechanism carefully by high order DNS. The randomization was originally considered as a result of large background noise and non-periodic spanwise boundary conditions. It was addressed that the large ring structure is affected by background noises first and then the change of large ring structure affects the small length scale quickly, which directly leads to randomization and formation of turbulence. However, what we observed is that the loss of symmetry starts from the middle level rings while the top and bottom rings are still symmetric. The nonsymmetric structure of second level rings will influence the small length scales at the boundary layer bottom quickly. The symmetry loss at the bottom of the boundary layer is quickly spread to up level through ejections. This will lead to randomization of the whole flow field. Therefore, the internal instability of multiple level ring structure, especially the middle ring cycles, is the main reason for flow randomization, but not the background noise. A hypothesis is given that the loss of symmetry may be caused by the shift from C-type transition to K-type transition or reverses.",14,[],9

Applying appropriate perturbation techniques leads first to a reduction of dimensionality in which the spatially dependent Neumann boundary condition translate into a boundary-induced advection term and, secondly, to an equation of motion for the traveling wave position in weakly corrugated confinements. Comparisons with numerical simulations demonstrate that our analytical results properly predicts the nonlinear dependence of the propagation velocity on ratio of the spatial period of the confinement to the intrinsic width of the front; including the peculiarity of propagation failure. Based on the eikonal equation, we obtain an analytical estimate for the finite interval of propagation failure.

1411.0614,nlin,"In this work, we consider time-periodic structures of trimer granular crystals consisting of alternate chrome steel and tungsten carbide spherical particles yielding a spatial periodicity of three. The configuration at the left boundary is driven by a harmonic in-time actuation with given amplitude and frequency while the right one is a fixed wall. Similar to the case of a dimer chain, the combination of dissipation, driving of the boundary, and intrinsic nonlinearity leads to complex dynamics. For fixed driving frequencies in each of the spectral gaps, we find that the nonlinear surface modes and the states dictated by the linear drive collide in a saddle-node bifurcation as the driving amplitude is increased, beyond which the dynamics of the system become chaotic. While the bifurcation structure is similar for solutions within the first and second gap, those in the first gap appear to be less robust. We also conduct a continuation in driving frequency, where it is apparent that the nonlinearity of the system results in a complex bifurcation diagram, involving an intricate set of loops of branches, especially within the spectral gap. The theoretical findings are qualitatively corroborated by the experimental full-field visualization of the time-periodic structures.",14,[],9

In this work we study numerically the effects that a third LCO induces to the collective behavior of the system. We analyze the new system by dealing with directed heterogeneous couplings among the units.

1409.1547,nlin,"Long term behavior of nonlinear deterministic continuous time signals can be studied in terms of their reconstructed attractors. Reconstructed attractors of a continuous signal are meant to be topologically equivalent representations of the dynamics of the unknown dynamical system which generates the signal. Sometimes, geometry of the attractor or its complexity may give important information on the system of interest. However, if the trajectories of the attractor behave as if they are not coming from continuous system or there exists many spike like structures on the path of the system trajectories, then there is no way to characterize the shape of the attractor. In this article, the traditional attractor reconstruction method is first used for two types of ECG signals: Normal healthy persons (NHP) and Congestive Heart failure patients (CHFP). As common in such a framework, the reconstructed attractors are not at all well formed and hence it is not possible to adequately characterize their geometrical features. Thus, we incorporate frequency domain information to the given time signals. This is done by transforming the signals to a time frequency domain by means of suitable Wavelet transforms (WT). The transformed signal concerns two non homogeneous variables and is still quite difficult to use to reconstruct some dynamics out of it. By applying a suitable mapping, this signal is further converted into integer domain and a new type of 3D plot, called integer lag plot, which characterizes and distinguishes the ECG signals of NHP and CHFP, is finally obtained.",14,[],9

In particular we study the validity of a version of Derrick's theorem, the criterion of Bogolubsky as well as the Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion, and find that these criteria yield inconsistent results. Therefore, we study the stability by numerical simulations using a recently developed 4th-order operator splitting integration method. For different ranges of equation we map out the stability regimes in equation. We find that all stable nonlinear Dirac solitary waves have a one-hump profile, but not all one-hump waves are stable, while all waves with two humps are unstable.

The resulting formulation is illustrated by application to a network Kuramoto problem with degree assortativity and correlation between the node degrees and the natural oscillation frequencies. Good agreement is found between the solutions of the reduced set of ordinary differential equations obtained from our theory and full simulations of the system. These results highlight the ability of our method to capture all the phase transitions (bifurcations) and system attractors. One interesting result is that degree assortativity can induce transitions from a steady macroscopic state to a temporally oscillating macroscopic state through both (presumed) Hopf and SNIPER (saddle-node, infinite period) bifurcations.

1406.5278,nlin,"We point out the existence of a transition from partial to global generalized synchronization (GS) in symmetrically coupled structurally different time-delay systems of different orders using the auxiliary system approach and the mutual false nearest neighbor method. The present authors have recently reported that there exists a common GS manifold even in an ensemble of structurally nonidentical scalar time-delay systems with different fractal dimensions and shown that GS occurs simultaneously with phase synchronization (PS). In this paper we confirm that the above result is not confined just to scalar one-dimensional time-delay systems alone but there exists a similar type of transition even in the case of time-delay systems with different orders. We calculate the maximal transverse Lyapunov exponent to evaluate the asymptotic stability of the complete synchronization manifold of each of the main and the corresponding auxiliary systems, which in turn ensures the stability of the GS manifold between the main systems. Further we estimate the correlation coefficient and the correlation of probability of recurrence to establish the relation between GS and PS. We also calculate the mutual false nearest neighbor parameter which doubly confirms the occurrence of the global GS manifold.",14,[],9

With time-periodic forcing related but time-dependent structures may result. These may consist of breathing localized patterns, or states that grow for part of the cycle via nucleation of new wavelengths of the pattern followed by wavelength annihilation during the remainder of the cycle. These two competing processes lead to a complex phase diagram whose structure is a consequence of a series of resonances between the nucleation time and the forcing period. The resulting diagram is computed for the periodically forced quadratic-cubic Swift--Hohenberg equation, and its details interpreted in terms of the properties of the depinning transition for the fronts bounding the localized state on either side.

1409.5974,nlin,"For the purpose of phase space reconstruction from nonlinear time series, delay selection is one of the most vital criteria. This is normally done by using a general measure viz., mutual information (MI). However, in that case, the delay selection is limited to the estimation of a single delay using MI between two variables only. The corresponding reconstructed phase space is also not satisfactory. To overcome the situation, a high-dimensional estimator of the MI is used; it selects more than one delay between more than two variables. The quality of the reconstructed phase space is tested by shape distortion parameter (SD), it is found that even this multidimensional MI sometimes fails to produce a less distorted phase space. In this paper, an alternative nonlinear measure cross autocorrelation (CAC) is introduced. A comparative study is made between the reconstructed phase spaces of a known three dimensional Neuro dynamical model, Lorenz dynamical model and a three dimensional food web model under MI for two and higher dimensions and also under cross auto-correlation separately. It is found that the least distorted phase space is obtained only under the notion of cross autocorrelation.",14,[],9

We propose the finite-difference method for numerical solving of a general class of multivariate nonlinear self-consistent time-dependent Fokker-Planck equations. We illustrate the accuracy and reliability of the method. Numerical study of the nonlinear self-consistent Fokker-Planck equation solutions for a stochastic brusselator shows that in the region of Turing bifurcation several types of solutions exist if noise intensity increases: unimodal solution, transient bimodality, and an interesting solution which involves multiple repumping of probability density through bimodality.

The speed of high performance induction motor drive is controlled by IFOC method. The knowledge of qualitative change of the behavior of the motor such as equilibrium points, limit cycles and chaos with the change of motor parameters and load torque are essential for proper control of the motor. This paper provides a numerical approach to understand better the dynamical behavior of an indirect field oriented control of a current-fed induction motor.

1402.4149,nlin,"We study closed dense collections of hard spheres that collide inelastically with constant coefficient of normal restitution. We find inhomogeneous states (IS) where the density profile is spatially non-uniform but constant in time. The states are exact solutions of non-linear partial differential equations that describe the coupled distributions of density and temperature when inelastic losses of energy per collision are small. The derivation is performed without modelling the equations' coefficients that are unknown in the dense limit (such as the equation of state), using only their scaling form specific for hard spheres. The IS is exact non-linear state of this many-body system. It captures a fundamental property of inelastic collections of particles: the possibility of preserving non-uniform temperature via the interplay of inelastic cooling and heat conduction, generalizing previous results in the dilute case. We perform numerical simulations to demonstrate that arbitrary initial state evolves to the IS in the limit of long times where the container has the geometry of the channel. The evolution is like gas-liquid transition. The liquid condenses in a vanishing part of the total volume but takes most of the mass of the system. However, the gaseous phase, which mass grows only logarithmically with the system size, is relevant because its fast particles carry most of the energy of the system. Remarkably, the system self-organizes to dissipate no energy: the inelastic decay of energy is a power-law equation where equation diverges in the thermodynamic limit. This behavior is caused by unusual spatial distribution of particles: on approach to one of the container's walls the density grows inversely with the distance.

The complex-valued polarization function is derived in detail and shown to be expressible in terms of square-root functions. For a contact-interaction the perturbative contributions to the energy per particle equation are calculated in closed analytical form from third up to twelfth order. The resummation of the particle-hole ring diagrams to all orders is studied and a pronounced dependence on the dimensionless coupling parameter equation is found. There is a substantial difference between the complete ring-sum with all exchange-type diagrams included and the standard resummation of the leading equation-ring diagrams only. The spin factor equation associated to the equation-th order ring diagrams is derived for arbitrary spin-degeneracy equation.,14,[],11
1403.4375,nucl-th,"The new definition of the energy dependence for the level density parameter including collective effects depends strongly on the semi-classical approach. For this method, defining an accurate single-particle potential is of great importance. The effect of the single-particle potential terms, which are central, spin-orbit, harmonic oscillator, Woods-Saxon and Coulomb potential, both for spherical and deformed cases, on the level density parameter was investigated by examining the local success of the global parameterizations of eight different combinations of these terms. Among these combinations, the sum of the central, spin-orbit, harmonic oscillator and Coulomb potentials, gives the most accurate predictions compared with experimental data. The local selections of the global parameterizations show that the single-particle models, which are based on Woods-Saxon potential as the main term, are more suitable candidates than the models based on harmonic oscillator potential to extrapolate away far from stability. Also it can be concluded that the contribution of the Coulomb interaction, both around the closed and open shells is not neglectable.",14,[],11

These include an abrupt change of the effective number of degrees of freedom, a change of the slope of the ratio of lambda hyperons to protons at laboratory energies 8.6--11.6 AGeV, as well as highly correlated plateaus in the collision-energy dependence of the entropy per baryon, total pion number per baryon, and thermal pion number per baryon at laboratory energies 6.9-11.6 AGeV. Also, we observe a sharp peak in the dimensionless trace anomaly at a laboratory energy of 11.6 AGeV. On the basis of the generalized shock-adiabat model we demonstrate that these observations give evidence for the anomalous thermodynamic properties of the mixed phase at its boundary to the quark-gluon plasma. We argue that the trace-anomaly peak and the local minimum of the generalized specific volume observed at a laboratory energy of 11.6 AGeV provide a signal for the formation of a mixed phase between the quark-gluon plasma and the hadron phase. This naturally explains the change of slope in the energy dependence of the yield of lambda hyperons per proton at a laboratory energy of 8.6 GeV.",14,[],11

1410.3624,nucl-th,"We present a comparative analysis of two models for the equation reaction, which take into account the isobar configurations in the ground state of the nuclei: the equation correlation model and the quasifree pion photoproduction model. The considered models differ in their descriptions of the nucleus states. The equation correlation model takes into account the dynamic correlations of the nucleon and isobar formed in the virtual transition equation, and in the quasifree pion photoproduction model, isobars and nucleons in the nucleus are considered as independent constituents. The predictions of the models are considered for two reactions equationOequationC and equationOequationO. It is shown, that the two models predict the differential cross section significantly differing both in absolute values, and in the shape of the angular dependence. We compare the results of the equation correlation model for the equation and equation reactions with the equationOequation reaction data measured at BNL. Our results give support to the equation correlation model.",14,[],11

Expansion in series by gaussoids of the wave function of 9Be and presentation of the Glauber operator in the form, conjugated with three-body wave function, allow us to calculate analytically the matrix elements of inelastic scattering, taking into account all of the multiplicities of scattering and rescattering on clusters and nucleon, that are the components of 9Be. The drawn up profiles of excited state functions allow us to make conclusion on their extended neutron distributions.

C 88, 014614 (2013)], we reported our analysis for the multi-nucleon transfer processes for several systems. Here we discuss effects of particle evaporation processes on the production cross sections. Since particle evaporation processes may not be described adequately by the TDHF calculations, we evaluate them using a statistical model. As an input of the statistical model, excitation energies of the final fragments are necessary. We evaluate them from the TDHF wave function after collisions, extending the particle number projection technique. From the calculation, the particle evaporation effects are found to improve descriptions of the production cross sections. However, the production cross sections are still underestimated for processes where a number of protons are transferred. Possible origins of the discrepancy are discussed.",14,[],11

The potential barrier is computed in the framework of the macroscopic-microscopic model. The microscopic part is based on the Woods-Saxon two center shell model. The alpha-decay of a superheavy element is treated, by paying a special attention to the region of the scission configurations. The sequence of nuclear shapes follows the superasymmetric fission path for alpha decay. It was found that the pairing gaps of the states that reach asymptotically the potential well of the alpha particle have large values at scission but become zero after scission. The 1s1/2 single particle levels of the nascent alpha particle are fully occupied while the superior levels are empties in the scission region and remains in the same states during the penetration of the Coulomb barrier.

Four RCI approximations are investigated: (1) the M1--RCI adopting the equation (the ratio of Coulomb energy coefficient to temperature) determined from the IYR of mirror-nuclei fragment; (2) the M2--RCI by fitting the difference between IYRs; (3) the M3--RCI by adopting the standard Coulomb energy at a temperature equationMeV; and (4) neglecting the RCI among the three isobars. The M1--, M2-- and M3--RCI is found to no larger than 0.4. In particular, the M2--RCI is very close to zero. The effects of RCI in the equation of fragment are also studied. The M1-- and M4--equation are found to be the lower and upper limitations of equation, respectively. The M2--equation overlaps the M4--equation, which indicates that the M2--RCI is negligible, at the same time the RCI among the three isobars can be neglected.

1406.4595,nucl-th,"The 16O(e,e'p) reaction in the quasi-elastic region has been studied in several experiments to determine spectroscopic factors, hence, the degree to which equationO looks like a closed shell. By varying the kinematics, experimentalists are able to extract response functions which comprise the cross section. However, analysis of the response functions separately produces very different spectroscopic factors. Two calculations led to different conclusions as to whether exchange currents can eliminate the discrepancies. Neither calculation considered relativistic corrections.   The purpose of the article is to investigate the disagreement as to whether exchange currents are the solution to obtaining consistent spectroscopic factors, and to show that relativistic corrections have a much greater influence on providing this consistency.   This calculation employs the recoil corrected continuum shell model, a model that uses a realistic interaction, and produces non-spurious scatterings states that are solutions to the coupled channels problems. Pionic and pair contributions to the exchange currents were calculated as developed by Dubach, Koch, and Donnelly. Relativistic effects are included by use of the direct Pauli reduction.   Contributions of the exchange currents are shown to be insufficient to provide consistent spectroscopic factors. However, the inclusion of relativistic corrections, that can be large, lead to more consistent spectroscopic factors and cross sections. The influence of channel coupling is also shown to be significant. Tests of current conservation show that inclusion of the direct Pauli reduction produces small increases in its violation. Response functions which depend on the transverse current are sensitive to the lower component of relativistic wave functions, and hence, would provide a measure of the appropriateness of any relativistic model.",14,[],11

We achieved a high peak efficiency of 0.12% using transform limited 150 fs pulses and observed saturation of the optical to THz conversion efficiency at a fluence of 15 mJ/cm2. We experimentally identify two main limitations for the scaling of optical-to-THz conversion efficiencies: (i) the large spectral broadening of the optical pump spectrum in combination with large angular dispersion of the tilted-pulse-front and (ii) free-carrier absorption of THz radiation due to multi-photon absorption of the 800 nm radiation.",14,[],5

The processes that contribute to their absorption are interrelated and highly dispersive, so the only current method of optimizing the absorption is by intensive numerical calculations. We present an efficient alternative which depends solely on the wavelength-dependent refractive indices of the constituent materials. We choose each array parameter such that the number of modes propagating away from the absorber is minimized while the number of resonant modes within the absorber is maximized. From this we develop a semi-analytic method that quantitatively identifies the small range of parameters where arrays achieve maximum short circuit currents. This provides a fast route to optimizing NW array cell efficiencies by greatly reducing the geometries to study with full device models.

We confirm that the susceptibility measure goes awry for the SIR model due to the bimodal distribution of outbreak sizes near the critical point, while the simulated thresholds of the SIS and SIR models can be accurately determined by analyzing the peak of the epidemic variability. We further verify the accuracy of theoretical predictions derived by the heterogeneous mean-field theory (HMF) and the quenched mean-field theory (QMF), by comparing them with the simulated threshold of the SIR model obtained from the variability measure.

1412.1753,physics,"The friction drag reduction in a turbulent channel flow generated by surface-mounted rotating disc actuators is investigated numerically. The wall arrangement of the discs has a complex and unexpected effect on the flow. For low disc-tip velocities, the drag reduction scales linearly with the percentage of the actuated area, whereas for higher disc-tip velocity the drag reduction can be larger than the prediction found through the linear scaling with actuated area. For medium disc-tip velocities, all the cases which display this additional drag reduction exhibit stationary-wall regions between discs along the streamwise direction. This effect is caused by the viscous boundary layer which develops over the portions of stationary wall due to the radial flow produced by the discs. For the highest disc-tip velocity, the drag reduction even increases by halving the number of discs. The power spent to activate the discs is instead independent of the disc arrangement and scales linearly with the actuated area for all disc-tip velocities. The Fukagata-Iwamoto-Kasagi identity and flow visualizations are employed to provide further insight into the dynamics of the streamwise-elongated structures appearing between discs. Sufficient interaction between adjacent discs along the spanwise direction must occur for the structures to be created at the disc side where the wall velocity is directed in the opposite direction to the streamwise mean flow. Novel half-disc and annular actuators are investigated to improve the disc-flow performance, resulting in a maximum of 26\% drag reduction.",14,[],5

The spatially resolved spectroscopy predicts the change in the concentration of the absorber by measuring the slope of attenuation data according to the separation and calculating the absorption coefficients of tissue on the basis of the slop in attenuation at the separation distance satisfying the linearity of this slop. This study analyzed the appropriate source-detector separation distance by using the diffuse approximation resolution for photon migration when predicting the absorption coefficient by the spatially resolved spectroscopy on the basis of the reflective image of the tissue. We imagine the 3 dimensional attenuation image with the absorption coefficient, reduced scattering coefficient and separation distance as its axes and obtained the attenuation data cube by calculating the attenuation on a certain interval of coordinate on the basis of the diffuse approximation expression. We predicted the separation distance appropriate for the application of the spatially resolved spectroscopy by calculating and analyzing the first derivatives and second derivatives of attenuation with respect to the coordinates and also doing the differential pathlength factors and first derivatives of the attenuation with respect to the absorption coefficient from the attenuation data cube.

Such linear formulations exclude the nonlinear distortion that would be caused by multiplication of the complete scattering pattern with the mask function.

Although previously described in phylogenetically basal aquatic insects like stone flies, the biomechanics of interfacial flight has never been analyzed. Here, we report interfacial flight as an adapted behaviour in water-lily beetles (Galerucella nymphaeae, Linnaeus 1758) which are also dexterous airborne fliers. We present the first quantitative biomechanical model of interfacial flight in insects, uncovering an intricate interplay of capillary, aerodynamic and neuromuscular forces. We show that water-lily beetles use their tarsal claws to attach themselves to the interface, via a fluid contact line pinned at the claw. We investigate the kinematics of interfacial flight trajectories using high-speed imaging and construct a mathematical model describing the flight dynamics. Our results show that nonlinear surface tension forces make interfacial flight energetically expensive compared to airborne flight at the relatively high speeds characteristic of water-lily beetles, and cause chaotic dynamics to arise naturally in these regimes.

Here, we describe the optics of an opal using a flexible model based upon a stratified medium whose (effective) index is governed by the opal density in a small planar slice of the opal. We take into account the effect of the substrate and assume a well- controlled number of layers, as it occurs for an opal fabricated by Langmuir-Blodgett deposition. The calculations are performed with transfer matrices, and an absorptive component in the effective index is introduced to account for the light scattering. This one-dimensional formalism allows quantitative predictions for reflection and transmission, notably as a function of the ratio between the irradiation wavelength and the sphere diameter, or as a function of the incidence angle or of the polarization. It can be used for an irradiation from the substrate side or from the vacuum side and can account for defect layers. The interface region between the opal and the substrate (or vacuum) is shown to have a strong influence, regardless of the exact opal structure. This break in the periodicity at the interface is a general, but often ignored feature, of any external coupling to a photonic crystal. Our calculations provide also the main features of the Bragg peak for reflection, including its width and strength.

In the geostrophic regime, which is of direct relevance to most geo- and astrophysical flows, the system is strongly rotated while maintaining a sufficiently large thermal driving to generate turbulence. We directly simulate the Navier--Stokes equations for two values of the thermal forcing, i.e. equation and equation, a constant Prandtl number~equation, and vary the Ekman number in the range equation to equation which satisfies both requirements of super-criticality and strong rotation. We focus on the differences between the application of no-slip vs. stress-free boundary conditions on the horizontal plates. The transition is found at roughly the same parameter values for both boundary conditions, i.e. at~equation for~equation and at~equation for~equation. However, the transition is gradual and it does not exactly coincide in~equation for different flow indicators. In particular, we report the characteristics of the transitions in the heat transfer scaling laws, the boundary-layer thicknesses, the bulk/boundary-layer distribution of dissipations and the mean temperature gradient in the bulk. The flow phenomenology in the geostrophic regime evolves differently for no-slip and stress-free plates. For stress-free conditions the formation of a large-scale barotropic vortex with associated inverse energy cascade is apparent. For no-slip plates, a turbulent state without large-scale coherent structures is found; the absence of large-scale structure formation is reflected in the energy transfer in the sense that the inverse cascade, present for stress-free boundary conditions, vanishes.",14,[],5

The concomitant theory should reveal details of the cities' past and also of its interaction with nearby urban conglomerates for providing a reasonably complete picture. Using the exhaustive database of the Census Bureau in a time window of 170 years, we exhibit here empirical evidence for time and space correlations in the demographic dynamics of US counties, with a characteristic memory-time of 25 years and typical distances of interaction of 200 km. These correlations are much larger than those observed in an European country (Spain), giving to the US a more coherent evolution. We also measure the resilience of US cities to historical events, finding a demographical post-traumatic amnesia after wars (as the Civil War) or economic crisis (as the 1929 Stock Market Crash).",14,[],5
1410.6529,physics,"Doubly occupied configuration interaction (DOCI) with optimized orbitals often accurately describes strong correlations while working in a Hilbert space much smaller than that needed for full configuration interaction. However, the scaling of such calculations remains combinatorial with system size. Pair coupled cluster doubles (pCCD) is very successful in reproducing DOCI energetically, but can do so with low polynomial scaling (equation, disregarding the two-electron integral transformation from atomic to molecular orbitals). We show here several examples illustrating the success of pCCD in reproducing both the DOCI energy and wave function, and show how this success frequently comes about. What DOCI and pCCD lack are an effective treatment of dynamic correlations, which we here add by including higher-seniority cluster amplitudes which are excluded from pCCD. This frozen pair coupled cluster approach is comparable in cost to traditional closed-shell coupled cluster methods with results that are competitive for weakly correlated systems and often superior for the description of strongly correlated systems.",14,[],5
1401.2888,physics,"As part of a large-scale assessment project at a large university, we administered weekly pre-tests and bi-weekly post-tests in the recitation sections of our introductory classes over four semesters from Spring 2010 through Fall 2011. The post-tests were administered as graded quizzes and were developed to assess problem solving, laboratory, calculational and conceptual skills that had been the focus of instruction in lab, lecture and recitation sessions. They were not comprehensive, but gave us 'snapshots' of students' abilities throughout the semester. They were used in conjunction with other forms of assessment, such as conceptual inventories, to give us a broader picture of the state of our undergraduate classes, recitation sections and laboratories. The written pre- and post-tests, which required students to show their work and explain their reasoning, yielded different information on students' skills than the conceptual inventories. On almost all of the questions, the students in the inquiry-based course performed better than all of the other students in both the calculus-based and algebra-based classes. This study indicates that the inquiry-based students perform better at free-response questions that require students to show their work and explain their reasoning, even though their conceptual inventory scores are not significantly different from students in large lecture sections taught with Physics Education Research-informed (PER-informed) laboratories, recitations and lectures, as reported in a previous paper.

Obtaining energy from an ambient vibration has been attractive for remotely installed standalone microsystems and devices. The mechanical noises in the ambient environment can be converted to electrical energy by a piezo strip based on the principle of piezoelectric effect. In this work, we have designed and developed a standalone energy harvesting module based on piezo transduction mechanisms. Using this designed module we harvested noise energy and stored electrical energy in a capacitor.

1412.6503,physics,"We develop a low Mach number formulation of the hydrodynamic equations describing transport of mass and momentum in a multispecies mixture of incompressible miscible liquids at specified temperature and pressure that generalizes our prior work on ideal mixtures of ideal gases and binary liquid mixtures. In this formulation we combine and extend a number of existing descriptions of multispecies transport available in the literature. The formulation applies to non-ideal mixtures of arbitrary number of species, without the need to single out a 'solvent' species, and includes contributions to the diffusive mass flux due to gradients of composition, temperature and pressure. Momentum transport and advective mass transport are handled using a low Mach number approach that eliminates fast sound waves (pressure fluctuations) from the full compressible system of equations and leads to a quasi-incompressible formulation. Thermal fluctuations are included in our fluctuating hydrodynamics description following the principles of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. We extend the semi-implicit staggered-grid finite-volume numerical method developed in our prior work on binary liquid mixtures, and use it to study the development of giant nonequilibrium concentration fluctuations in a ternary mixture subjected to a steady concentration gradient. We also numerically study the development of diffusion-driven gravitational instabilities in a ternary mixture, and compare our numerical results to recent experimental measurements in a Hele-Shaw cell. We find that giant nonequilibrium fluctuations can trigger the instability but are eventually dominated by the deterministic growth of the unstable mode, in both quasi two-dimensional (Hele-Shaw), and fully three-dimensional geometries used in typical shadowgraph experiments.",14,[],5
1412.7776,physics,"Since the forward and backward waves are coupled with each other and a standing wave with no net propagation of energy is formed in the photonic bandgap, it is a commonsense of basic physics that, any kinds of effects associated with wave propagation including four-wave-mixing (FWM) are thought to be impossible. However, we lay great emphasis here on explaining that this commonsense could be broken under specific circumstances. In this article, we report with the first experimental observation of the energy conversion in the photonic bandgap into other channel via FWM. Owing to the phase manipulation by fast light effect in the photonic bandgap, we manage to achieve the phase-match condition and thus occurred FWM transfer energy into other channels outside the photonic bandgap efficiently. As one-dimensional photonic crystal, simulations on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) with and without fast light were conducted respectively, and an enhanced FWM in photonic bandgap of FBG was observed. The experimental result shows great agreement with the analysis.",14,[],5

In this model a steadily crawling fragment is represented by a layer of active gel placed on a frictional surface and driven by contraction only. We find analytically the distribution of contractile elements (pullers) ensuring that the efficiency of self-propulsion is maximal. We then show that natural assumptions about advection and diffusion of pullers produce a distribution that is remarkably close to the optimal one and is qualitatively similar to the one observed in experiments on fish keratocytes.,14,[],5

We quantify the relative importance of the most probable path between two nodes with respect to the whole set of paths, and to a subset of highly probable paths which incorporate most of the connection probability. These concepts are used to provide alternative definitions of betweenness centrality. We apply our formalism to a transport network describing surface flow in the Mediterranean sea. Despite the full transport dynamics is described by a very large number of paths we find that, for realistic time scales, only a very small subset of high probability paths (or even a single most probable one) is enough to characterize global connectivity properties of the network.",14,[],5
1403.0528,physics,"U.S. Tsunami Warning Centers use real-time bottom pressure (BP) data transmitted from a network of buoys deployed in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans to tune source coefficients of tsunami forecast models. For accurate coefficients and therefore forecasts, tides at the buoys must be accounted for. In this study, five methods for coefficient estimation are compared, each of which accounts for tides differently. The first three subtract off a tidal prediction based on (1) a localized harmonic analysis involving 29 days of data immediately preceding the tsunami event, (2) 68 pre-existing harmonic constituents specific to each buoy, and (3) an empirical orthogonal function fit to the previous 25 hrs of data. Method (4) is a Kalman smoother that uses method (1) as its input. These four methods estimate source coefficients after detiding. Method (5) estimates the coefficients simultaneously with a two-component harmonic model that accounts for the tides. The five methods are evaluated using archived data from eleven DART buoys, to which selected artificial tsunami signals are superimposed. These buoys represent a full range of observed tidal conditions and background BP noise in the Pacific and Atlantic, and the artificial signals have a variety of patterns and induce varying signal-to-noise ratios. The root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of least squares estimates of sources coefficients using varying amounts of data are used to compare the five detiding methods. The RMSE varies over two orders of magnitude between detiding methods, generally decreasing in the order listed, with method (5) yielding the most accurate estimate of source coefficient. The RMSE is substantially reduced by waiting for the first full wave of the tsunami signal to arrive. As a case study, the five method are compared using data recorded from the devastating 2011 Japan tsunami.",14,[],5

1408.4330,physics,"The application of tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) to flames with non-homogeneous temperature and concentration fields is an area where only few studies exist. Experimental work explores the performance of tomographic reconstructions of concentration and temperature profiles from wavelength-modulated TDLAS measurements within the plume of an axisymmetric McKenna burner. Water vapor transitions at 1391.67 nm and 1442.67 nm are probed using calibration free wavelength modulation spectroscopy with second harmonic detection (WMS-2f). A single collimated laser beam is swept parallel to the burner surface, where scans yield pairs of line-of-sight (LOS) data at multiple radial locations. Radial profiles of absorption data are reconstructed using Tikhonov regularized Abel inversion, which suppresses the amplification of experimental noise that is typically observed for reconstructions with high spatial resolution. Based on spectral data, temperatures and concentrations are calculated point-by-point. Here, a least-squares approach addresses difficulties due to modulation depths that cannot be universally optimized due to a non-uniform domain. Experimental results show successful reconstructions of temperature and concentration profiles based on two-transition, non-optimally modulated WMS-2f and Tikhonov regularized Abel inversion, and thus validate the technique as a viable diagnostic tool for flame measurements.",14,[],5

1409.8668,physics,"Femtosecond electron bunches with keV energies and eV energy spread are needed by condensed matter physicists to resolve state transitions in carbon nanotubes, molecular structures, organic salts, and charge density wave materials. These semirelativistic electron sources are not only of interest for ultrafast electron diffraction, but also for electron energy-loss spectroscopy and as a seed for x-ray FELs. Thus far, the output energy spread (hence pulse duration) of ultrafast electron guns has been limited by the achievable electric field at the surface of the emitter, which is 10 MV/m for DC guns and 200 MV/m for RF guns. A single-cycle THz electron gun provides a unique opportunity to not only achieve GV/m surface electric fields but also with relatively low THz pulse energies, since a single-cycle transform-limited waveform is the most efficient way to achieve intense electric fields. Here, electron bunches of 50 fC from a flat copper photocathode are accelerated from rest to tens of eV by a microjoule THz pulse with peak electric field of 72 MV/m at 1 kHz repetition rate.

With laser absorption spectroscopy these parameters were measured using the molecular equationLiequation (R) transitions AequationXequation. In a typical regime, sublimating a matrix at 16 K, translational temperatures of 6--8 K with a drift velocity of 130 mequationsequation in a free expanding pulsed beam with molecular density of 10equation cmequation, averaged along the laser axis, were observed. Rotational temperatures around 5--7 K were obtained. In recent experiments we were able to monitor the atomic Li signal -- in the D2 line -- concomitantly with the molecular signal in order to compare them as a function of the number of ablation pulses. Based on the data and a simple model, we discuss the possibility that a fraction of these molecules are being formed in the matrix, by mating atoms from different ablation pulses, which would open up the way to formation of other more interesting and difficult molecules to be studied at low temperatures.

Our observations show that an initial spectrum that is confined in a limited domain of wave numbers becomes broad, even when the Reynold's number is much less than the critical value required for the onset of turbulence in Newtonian fluids. This is a signature of elastic turbulence where Weissenberg's number also plays a role in the onset of turbulence. This has been reported in several experiments.

1406.5668,physics,"This paper is a continuation of our earlier work [Z.L. Guo \it et al., Phys. Rev. E \bf 88, 033305 (2013)] where a multiscale numerical scheme based on kinetic model was developed for low speed isothermal flows with arbitrary Knudsen numbers. In this work, a discrete unified gas-kinetic scheme (DUGKS) for compressible flows with the consideration of heat transfer and shock discontinuity is developed based on the Shakhov model with an adjustable Prandtl number. The method is an explicit finite-volume scheme where the transport and collision processes are coupled in the evaluation of the fluxes at cell interfaces, so that the nice asymptotic preserving (AP) property is retained, such that the time step is limited only by the CFL number, the distribution function at cell interface recovers to the Chapman-Enskog one in the continuum limit while reduces to that of free-transport for free-molecular flow, and the time and spatial accuracy is of second-order accuracy in smooth region. These features make the DUGKS an ideal method for multiscale compressible flow simulations. A number of numerical tests, including the shock structure problem, the Sod tube problem with different degree of non-equilibrium, and the two-dimensional Riemann problem in continuum and rarefied regimes, are performed to validate the scheme.

Simulation results show that transuranic elements up to Bk-249 can be produced in multiple neutron capture reactions in macroscopic quantities. However, the neutron flux achievable in a spallation target is still insufficient to overcome the so-called fermium gap.

After melting of the crystalline structure, the mean kinetic energy of the particles continued to grow further, preventing recrystallisation of the melted phase. The effect could not be reproduced in simulations employing a simple point-like wake model.

On the basis of the predictions of effective Hamiltonian models, a total of 1759, 1786, 335, 273 and 551 transitions belonging to 24, 24, 5, 4 and 7 bands were rovibrationally assigned for 627, 728, 637, 738 and 727, respectively. For comparison, only five bands were previously measured in the region for the 728 species. All the identified bands belong to the letterP=8 and 9 series of transitions, where P=2V1V23V3 is the polyad number (Vi are vibrational quantum numbers). The band-by-band analysis has allowed deriving accurate spectroscopic parameters of 61 bands from a fit of the measured line positions. Two interpolyad resonance perturbations were identified.",14,[],5
1405.7687,physics,"Extensive studies of pre-big bang scenarios for Bianchi-I type universe have been made, at various approximation levels. Knowing the solution of the equations for the post-big bang universe, the symmetries of the equations (time reversal and scale dual transformations) allow the study of pre-big bang solutions. However, the proposed solutions are unable to explain the actually observed acceleration of the expantion of the universe.Calculating the equation equations for the Non-Linear Sigma model, at the first loop approximation and imposing conformal invariance at this level, lead to equations of motion that simply state that the curvature must be nil, which in turn allows the utilization of groups to solve the equation equations. This is what is done in the Weiss-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model. In this article, I will show that using the WZW model on equation, some of the difficulties encountered in the determination of the pre and post big-bang solutions are eliminated. Combining the general results obtained with the equationCDM parameters lead to realistic solutions for the evolution of the universe, giving an explanation to the actually observed acceleration of the expansion in terms ot the dilation field equation(t).",14,[],5
1407.5147,physics,"A simple modification of the semiempirical model of Shevelko et al (J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt.

The contributions from the direct double ionization of outer shell and indirect processes of inner shells are also considered in the proposed modification. Ionic correction and relativistic factor are also incorporated. The results of the simplified model are compared with the experimental, quantum, and other semiempirical calculations where available.

1407.8381,physics,"Non-uniform temperature fields are analyzed, which arise in the problems of formation of the steady shock wave at impact and ramp loading of metals, exit of the steady shock wave to the free surface, and the shock wave passing through the interface between two different materials. Theoretical analysis and computations show that high-entropy (with the temperature increase) and low-entropy (with the temperature decrease) layers arise near the interfaces in the above problems of shock and ramp loading. The impact produces the high-entropy layer; while the ramp loading can result in the both high- and low-entropy layers. At the shock wave passing through the interface, the high-entropy layer is formed in the lower-impedance material and the low-entropy -- in the higher-impedance one. The formation of high-entropy layer at impact is supported by molecular-dynamics simulations in addition to continuum modeling. The high- and low-entropy layers should be taken into account in simulations of shock-wave processes in thin targets or in other cases where surface effects are important.",14,[],5

The energy modulation is then converted into a density modulation via ballistic bunching. The method is shown to support the generation of sub-picosecond bunch train with multi-kA peak currents. The relatively simple technique is expected to find applications in compact, accelerator-based, light sources and advanced beam-driven accelerator methods.",14,[],5
1401.3946,physics,"We study the emergence of altruistic behaviour in collective games. In particular, we take into account Toral's version of collective Parrondo's paradoxical games, in which the redistribution of capital between agents, who can play different strategies, creates a positive trend of increasing capital. In this framework, we insert two categories of players, altruistic and selfish ones, and see how they interact and how their capital evolves. More in detail, we analyse the positive effects of altruistic behaviour, but we also point out how selfish players take advantage of that situation. The general result is that altruistic behaviour is discouraged, because selfish players get richer while altruistic ones get poorer. We also consider a smarter way of being altruistic, based on reputation, called ""selective altruism"", which prevents selfish players from taking advantage of altruistic ones. In this new situation it is altruism, and not selfishness, to be encouraged and stabilized. Finally, we introduce a mechanism of imitation between players and study how it influences the composition of the population of both altruistic and selfish players as a function of time for different initial conditions and network topologies adopted.",14,[],5
1410.0542,physics,"A variational technique is used to derive analytical expressions for the sensitivity of recirculation length to steady forcing in separated flows. Linear sensitivity analysis is applied to the two-dimensional steady flow past a circular cylinder for Reynolds numbers equation, both in the subcritical and supercritical regimes. Regions which are the most sensitive to volume forcing and wall blowing/suction are identified. Control configurations which reduce the recirculation length are designed based on the sensitivity information, in particular small cylinders used as control devices in the wake of the main cylinder, and fluid suction at the cylinder wall. Validation against full non-linear Navier-Stokes calculations shows excellent agreement for small-amplitude control. The linear stability properties of the controlled flow are systematically investigated. At moderate Reynolds numbers, we observe that regions where control reduces the recirculation length correspond to regions where it has a stabilising effect on the most unstable global mode associated to vortex shedding, while this property does not hold any more at larger Reynolds numbers.",14,[],5

1402.0042,q-bio,"Next-generation sequencing technology enables the identification of thousands of gene regulatory sequences in many cell types and organisms. We consider the problem of testing if two such sequences differ in their number of binding site motifs for a given transcription factor (TF) protein. Binding site motifs impart regulatory function by providing TFs the opportunity to bind to genomic elements and thereby affect the expression of nearby genes. Evolutionary changes to such functional DNA are hypothesized to be major contributors to phenotypic diversity within and between species; but despite the importance of TF motifs for gene expression, no method exists to test for motif loss or gain. Assuming that motif counts are Binomially distributed, and allowing for dependencies between motif instances in evolutionarily related sequences, we derive the probability mass function of the difference in motif counts between two nucleotide sequences. We provide a method to numerically estimate this distribution from genomic data and show through simulations that our estimator is accurate. Finally, we introduce the R package \tt motifDiverge that implements our methodology and illustrate its application to gene regulatory enhancers identified by a mouse developmental time course experiment. While this study was motivated by analysis of regulatory motifs, our results can be applied to any problem involving two correlated Bernoulli trials.",14,[],10
1401.6524,q-bio,"Immigration can rescue local populations from extinction, helping to stabilise a metapopulation. Local population dynamics is important for determining the strength of this rescue effect, but the mechanistic link between local demographic parameters and the rescue effect at the metapopulation level has received very little attention by modellers. We develop an analytical framework that allows us to describe the emergence of the rescue effect from interacting local stochastic dynamics. We show this framework to be applicable to a wide range of spatial scales, providing a powerful and convenient alternative to individual-based models for making predictions concerning the fate of metapopulations. We show that the rescue effect plays an important role in minimising the increase in local extinction probability associated with high demographic stochasticity, but its role is more limited in the case of high local environmental stochasticity of recruitment or survival. While most models postulate the rescue effect, our framework provides an explicit mechanistic link between local dynamics and the emergence of the rescue effect, and more generally the stability of the whole metapopulation.",14,[],10
1410.2801,q-bio,"(An updated version of this manuscript has been accepted to Scientific Reports in 2016, please refer to http://www.nature.com/articles/srep31900)   The highly anticipated transition from next generation sequencing (NGS) to third generation sequencing (3GS) has been difficult primarily due to high error rates and excessive sequencing cost. The high error rates make the assembly of long erroneous reads of large genomes challenging because existing software solutions are often overwhelmed by error correction tasks. Here we report a hybrid assembly approach that simultaneously utilizes NGS and 3GS data to address both issues. We gain advantages from three general and basic design principles: (i) Compact representation of the long reads lead to efficient alignments. (ii) Base-level errors can be skipped; structural errors need to be detected and corrected. (iii) Structurally correct 3GS reads are assembled and polished. In our implementation, preassembled NGS contigs are used to derive the compact representation of the long reads, which established an algorithmic conversion from a de Bruijn graph to an overlap graph, the two major assembly paradigms. Moreover, since NGS and 3GS data can compensate each other, our hybrid assembly approach reduces both of their sequencing requirements. Experiments show that our software is able to assemble mammalian-sized genomes orders of magnitude more efficiently in time than existing methods, while saving about half of the sequencing cost.",14,[],10
1403.7556,q-bio,"Organisms have increased in complexity through a series of major evolutionary transitions, in which formerly autonomous entities become parts of a novel higher-level entity. One intriguing feature of the higher-level entity after some major transitions is a division of reproductive labor among its lower-level units. Although it can have clear benefits once established, it is unknown how such reproductive division of labor originates. We consider a recent evolution experiment on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a unique platform to address the issue of reproductive differentiation during an evolutionary transition in individuality. In the experiment, independent yeast lineages evolved a multicellular ""snowflake-like' cluster form in response to gravity selection. Shortly after the evolution of clusters, the yeast evolved higher rates of cell death. While cell death enables clusters to split apart and form new groups, it also reduces their performance in the face of gravity selection. To understand the selective value of increased cell death, we create a mathematical model of the cellular arrangement within snowflake yeast clusters. The model reveals that the mechanism of cell death and the geometry of the snowflake interact in complex, evolutionarily important ways. We find that the organization of snowflake yeast imposes powerful limitations on the available space for new cell growth. By dying more frequently, cells in clusters avoid encountering space limitations, and, paradoxically, reach higher numbers. In addition, selection for particular group sizes can explain the increased rate of apoptosis both in terms of total cell number and total numbers of collectives. Thus, by considering the geometry of a primitive multicellular organism we can gain insight into the initial emergence of reproductive division of labor during an evolutionary transition in individuality.",14,[],10
1410.7004,q-bio,"Reconciliation methods aim at recovering macro evolutionary events and at localizing them in the species history, by observing discrepancies between gene family trees and species trees. In this article we introduce an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach for the NP-hard problem of computing a most parsimonious time-consistent reconciliation of a gene tree with a species tree when dating information on speciations is not available. The ILP formulation, which builds upon the DTL model, returns a most parsimonious reconciliation ranging over all possible datings of the nodes of the species tree. By studying its performance on plausible simulated data we conclude that the ILP approach is significantly faster than a brute force search through the space of all possible species tree datings. Although the ILP formulation is currently limited to small trees, we believe that it is an important proof-of-concept which opens the door to the possibility of developing an exact, parsimony based approach to dating species trees.

1409.7827,q-bio,"Epigenetic aberrations have profound effects on phenotypic output. Genome wide methylation alterations are inheritable to pass down the aberrations through multiple generations. We developed a statistical method, Genome-wide Identification of Significant Methylation Alteration, GISAIM, to study the significant transgenerational methylation changes. GISAIM finds the significant methylation aberrations that are inherited through multiple generations. In a concrete biological study, we investigated whether exposing pregnant rats (F0) to a high fat (HF) diet throughout pregnancy or ethinyl estradiol (EE2)-supplemented diet during gestation days 14 20 affects carcinogen-induced mammary cancer risk in daughters (F1), granddaughters (F2) and great-granddaughters (F3). Mammary tumorigenesis was higher in daughters and granddaughters of HF rat dams, and in daughters, granddaughters and great-granddaughters of EE2 rat dams. Outcross experiments showed that increased mammary cancer risk was transmitted to HF granddaughters equally through the female or male germlines, but is only transmitted to EE2 granddaughters through the female germline. Transgenerational effect on mammary cancer risk was associated with increased expression of DNA methyltransferases, and across all three EE2 generations hypo or hyper methylation of the same 375 gene promoter regions in their mammary glands. Our study shows that maternal dietary estrogenic exposures during pregnancy can increase breast cancer risk in multiple generations of offspring, and the increase in risk may be inherited through non-genetic means, possibly involving DNA methylation.",14,[],10

1410.5319,q-bio,"In post-transcriptional regulation, an mRNA molecule is bound by many proteins and/or miRNAs to modulate its function. To enable combinatorial gene regulation, these binding partners of an RNA must communicate with each other, exhibiting cooperativity. Even in the absence of direct physical interactions between the binding partners, such cooperativity can be mediated through RNA secondary structures, since they affect the accessibility of the binding sites. Here we propose a quantitative measure of this structure-mediated cooperativity that can be numerically calculated for an arbitrary RNA sequence. Focusing on an RNA with two binding sites, we derive a characteristic difference of free energy differences, i.e. letterletter G, as a measure of the effect of the occupancy of one binding site on the binding strength of another. We apply this measure to a large number of human and C. elegans mRNAs, and find that structure-mediated cooperativity is a generic feature. Interestingly, this cooperativity not only affects binding sites in close proximity along the sequence but also configurations in which one binding site is located in the 5'UTR and the other is located in the 3'UTR of the mRNA. Furthermore, we find that this end-to-end cooperativity is determined by the UTR sequences while the sequences of the coding regions are irrelevant.",14,[],10

1405.7926,q-bio,"We calculate potentials of the mean force for twenty amino acids in the vicinity of the (111) surface of gold, for several dipeptides, and for some analogs of the side chains, using molecular dynamics simulations and the umbrella sampling method. We compare results obtained within three different force fields: one hydrophobic (for a contaminated surface) and two hydrophilic. All of these fields lead to good binding with very different specificities and different patterns in the density and polarization of water. The covalent bond with the sulfur atom on cysteine is modeled by the Morse potential. We demonstrate that binding energies of dipeptides are different than the combined binding energies of their amino-acidic components. For the hydrophobic gold, adsorption events of a small protein are driven by attraction to the strongest binding amino acids. This is not so in the hydrophilic cases - a result of smaller specificities combined with the difficulty for proteins, but not for single amino acids, to penetrate the first layer of water. The properties of water near the surface sensitively depend on the force field.",14,[],10

To address this question, we construct ""in silico"" all possible biochemically feasible alternatives to the trunk pathway of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, one of the most highly conserved pathways in metabolism. We show that, even though a large number of alternative pathways exist, the alternatives carry lower flux than the real pathway under typical physiological conditions. Alternative pathways that could potentially carry higher flux often lead to infeasible intermediate metabolite concentrations. We also find that if physiological conditions were different, different pathways could outperform those found in nature. Our results demonstrate how the rules of biochemistry restrict the alternatives that are open to evolution, and suggest that the existing trunk pathway of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis represents a maximal flux solution.",14,[],10
1412.0780,q-bio,"Practically, all chemotherapeutic agents lead to drug resistance. Clinically, it is a challenge to determine whether resistance arises prior to, or as a result of, cancer therapy. Further, a number of different intracellular and microenvironmental factors have been correlated with the emergence of drug resistance. With the goal of better understanding drug resistance and its connection with the tumor microenvironment, we have developed a hybrid discrete-continuous mathematical model. In this model, cancer cells described through a particle-spring approach respond to dynamically changing oxygen and DNA damaging drug concentrations described through partial differential equations. We thoroughly explored the behavior of our self-calibrated model under the following common conditions: a fixed layout of the vasculature, an identical initial configuration of cancer cells, the same mechanism of drug action, and one mechanism of cellular response to the drug. We considered one set of simulations in which drug resistance existed prior to the start of treatment, and another set in which drug resistance is acquired in response to treatment. This allows us to compare how both kinds of resistance influence the spatial and temporal dynamics of the developing tumor, and its clonal diversity. We show that both pre-existing and acquired resistance can give rise to three biologically distinct parameter regimes: successful tumor eradication, reduced effectiveness of drug during the course of treatment (resistance), and complete treatment failure.",14,[],10
1405.3881,q-bio,"We develop a detailed theoretical framework for various types of transcription factor gene oscillators. We further demonstrate that one can build genetic-oscillators which are tunable and robust against perturbations in the critical control parameters by coupling two or more independent Goodwin-Griffith oscillators through either -OR- or -AND- type logic. Most of the coupled oscillators constructed in the literature so far seem to be of -OR- type. When there are transient perturbations in one of the -OR- type coupled-oscillators, then the overall period of the system remains constant (period-buffering) whereas in case of -AND- type coupling the overall period of the system moves towards the perturbed oscillator. Though there is a period-buffering, the amplitudes of oscillators coupled through -OR- type logic are more sensitive to perturbations in the parameters associated with the promoter state dynamics than -AND- type. Further analysis shows that the period of -AND- type coupled dual-feedback oscillators can be tuned without conceding on the amplitudes. Using these results we derive the basic design principles governing the robust and tunable synthetic gene oscillators without compromising on their amplitudes.",14,[],10
1404.0655,q-bio,"Practice of a complex motor gesture involves exploration of motor space to attain a better match to target output, but little is known about the neural code for such exploration.

Using mutual information to quantify the correlation between temporal sequences of spikes and time in song, we find that different symbols code for time in the two singing states. While isolated spikes code for particular parts of song during performance, extended strings of spiking and silence, particularly burst events, code for time in song during practice. This temporal coding during practice can be as precise as isolated spiking during performance to a female, supporting the hypothesis that neurons in LMAN actively sample motor space, guiding song modification at local instances in time.",14,[],10

1412.1746,q-bio,"The newly developed deep-sequencing technologies make it possible to acquire both quantitative and qualitative information regarding transcript biology. By measuring messenger RNA levels for all genes in a sample, RNA-seq provides an attractive option to characterize the global changes in transcription. RNA-seq is becoming the widely used platform for gene expression profiling. However, real transcription signals in the RNA-seq data are confounded with measurement and sequencing errors, and other random biological/technical variation. How to appropriately take the variability due to errors and sequencing technology variation into account is essential issue in the RNA-seq data analysis. To extract biologically useful transcription process from the RNA-seq data, we propose to use the second ODE for modeling the RNA-seq data. We use differential principal analysis to develop statistical methods for estimation of location-varying coefficients of the ODE. We validate the accuracy of the ODE model to fit the RNA-seq data by prediction analysis and 5 fold cross validation. We find the accuracy of the second ODE model to predict the gene expression level across the gene is very high and the second ODE model to fit the RNA-seq data very well. To further evaluate the performance of the ODE model for RNA-seq data analysis, we used the location-varying coefficients of the second ODE as features to classify the normal and tumor cells. We demonstrate that even using the ODE model for single gene we can achieve high classification accuracy.

1407.6959,q-bio,"A key aim of systems biology is the reconstruction of molecular networks, however we do not yet have networks that integrate information from all datasets available for a particular clinical condition. This is in part due to the limited scalability, in terms of required computational time and power, of existing algorithms. Network reconstruction methods should also be scalable in the sense of allowing scientists from different backgrounds to efficiently integrate additional data. We present a network model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In the current version (AML 2.1) we have used gene expression data (both microarray and RNA-seq) from five different studies comprising a total of 771 AML samples and a protein-protein interactions dataset. Our scalable network reconstruction method is in part based on the well-known property of gene expression correlation among interacting molecules. The difficulty of distinguishing between direct and indirect interactions is addressed optimizing the coefficient of variation of gene expression, using a validated gold standard dataset of direct interactions. Computational time is much reduced compared to other network reconstruction methods. A key feature is the study of the reproducibility of interactions found in independent clinical datasets. An analysis of the most significant clusters, and of the network properties (intraset efficiency, degree, betweenness centrality and PageRank) of common AML mutations demonstrated the biological significance of the network.

1402.0511,q-bio,"Human associated microbial communities exert tremendous influence over human health and disease. With modern metagenomic sequencing methods it is possible to follow the relative abundance of microbes in a community over time. These microbial communities exhibit rich ecological dynamics and an important goal of microbial ecology is to infer the interactions between species from sequence data. Any algorithm for inferring species interactions must overcome three obstacles: 1) a correlation between the abundances of two species does not imply that those species are interacting, 2) the sum constraint on the relative abundances obtained from metagenomic studies makes it difficult to infer the parameters in timeseries models, and 3) errors due to experimental uncertainty, or mis-assignment of sequencing reads into operational taxonomic units, bias inferences of species interactions. Here we introduce an approach, Learning Interactions from MIcrobial Time Series (LIMITS), that overcomes these obstacles. LIMITS uses sparse linear regression with boostrap aggregation to infer a discrete-time Lotka-Volterra model for microbial dynamics. We tested LIMITS on synthetic data and showed that it could reliably infer the topology of the inter-species ecological interactions. We then used LIMITS to characterize the species interactions in the gut microbiomes of two individuals and found that the interaction networks varied significantly between individuals. Furthermore, we found that the interaction networks of the two individuals are dominated by distinct ""keystone species"", Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroided stercosis, that have a disproportionate influence on the structure of the gut microbiome even though they are only found in moderate abundance. Based on our results, we hypothesize that the abundances of certain keystone species may be responsible for individuality in the human gut microbiome.",14,[],10

1404.1061,q-bio,"The genotype-fitness map plays a fundamental role in shaping the dynamics of evolution. However, it is difficult to directly measure a fitness landscape in practice, because the number of possible genotypes is astronomical. One approach is to sample as many genotypes as possible, measure their fitnesses, and fit a statistical model of the landscape that includes additive and pairwise interactive effects between loci. Here we elucidate the pitfalls of using such regressions, by studying artificial but mathematically convenient fitness landscapes. We identify two sources of bias inherent in these regression procedures that each tends to under-estimate high fitnesses and over-estimate low fitnesses. We characterize these biases for random sampling of genotypes, as well as for samples drawn from a population under selection in the Wright-Fisher model of evolutionary dynamics. We show that common measures of epistasis, such as the number of monotonically increasing paths between ancestral and derived genotypes, the prevalence of sign epistasis, and the number of local fitness maxima, are distorted in the inferred landscape. As a result, the inferred landscape will provide systematically biased predictions for the dynamics of adaptation. We identify the same biases in a computational RNA-folding landscape, as well as in regulatory sequence binding data, treated with the same fitting procedure. Finally, we present a method that may ameliorate these biases in some cases.",14,[],10
1410.7959,q-bio,"Elucidating the intricate relationship between brain structure and function, both in healthy and pathological conditions, is a key challenge for modern neuroscience. Recent technical and methodological progress in neuroimaging has helped advance our understanding of this important issue, with diffusion weighted images providing information about structural connectivity (SC) and functional magnetic resonance imaging shedding light on resting state functional connectivity (rsFC). However, comparing these two distinct datasets, each of which can be encoded into a different complex network, is by no means trivial as pairwise link-to-link comparisons represent a relatively restricted perspective and provide only limited information. Thus, we have adopted a more integrative systems approach, exploiting theoretical graph analyses to study both SC and rsFC datasets gathered independently from healthy human subjects. The aim is to find the main architectural traits shared by the structural and functional networks by paying special attention to their common hierarchical modular organization. This approach allows us to identify a common skeleton from which a new, optimal, brain partition can be extracted, with modules sharing both structure and function. We describe these emerging common structure-function modules (SFMs) in detail. In addition, we compare SFMs with the classical Resting State Networks derived from independent component analysis of rs-fMRI functional activity, as well as with anatomical parcellations in the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas and with the Broadmann partition, highlighting their similitude and differences. The unveiling of SFMs brings to light the strong correspondence between brain structure and resting-state dynamics.",14,[],10

Lett. 6: 462-467) identified four major shortcomings of the current implementation of the directive concerning prioritization of the annexes, conservation plans, survey systems and financial resources. However they did not account for the intended network character of the Natura 2000 sites, an aspect of highest relevance. This response letter deals with this shortcoming as it is the prerequisite, over any other strategies, ensuring a Natura 2020 network being worth its name.",14,[],10
1408.4950,q-bio,"There is increased interest in the identification and analysis of gene fusions and chimeric RNA transcripts. While most recent efforts focused on the analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data, identi-fication of novel peptides corresponding to such events in mass spectrometry-based proteomic datasets would provide complemen-tary, protein-level evidence. The process of identifying fusion pro-teins from mass spectrometry data is inherently difficult because such events are rare. It is also complicated due to large amount of spectra collected and the explosion in the number of candidate peptide sequences that need to be considered, which makes ex-haustive search for all possible fusion partner proteins impractical. In this work, we present a sequence tag based fusion protein identi-fication algorithm, FIT, that combines the virtue of both de novo sequence tag retrieval and peptide-spectrum matching for identifi-cation of fusion proteins. Results on simulated datasets show high sensitivity and low false positive rates for fusion protein identifica-tion by the FIT algorithm.",14,[],10
1409.7839,q-bio,"Adaptation to one environment often results in fitness gains and losses in other conditions. To characterize how these consequences of adaptation depend on the physical similarity between environments, we evolved 180 populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae at different degrees of stress induced by either salt, temperature, pH, or glucose depletion. We measure how the fitness of clones adapted to each environment depends on the intensity of the corresponding type of stress. We find that clones evolved in a given type and intensity of stress tend to gain fitness in other similar intensities of that stress, and lose progressively more fitness in more physically dissimilar environments. These fitness trade-offs are asymmetric: adaptation to permissive conditions incurred a smaller trade-off in stressful conditions than vice versa. We also find that fitnesses of clones are highly correlated across similar intensities of stress, but these correlations decay towards zero in more dissimilar environments. To interpret these results, we introduce the concept of a joint distribution of fitness effects of new mutations in multiple environments (the JDFE), which describes the probability that a given mutation has particular fitness effects in some set of conditions. We find that our observations are consistent with JDFEs that are highly correlated between physically similar environments, and that become less correlated and asymmetric as the environments become more dissimilar. The JDFE provides a framework for quantifying evolutionary similarity between conditions, and forms a useful basis for theoretical work aimed at predicting the outcomes of evolution in fluctuating environments.",14,[],10

The first chapter is devoted to my work in developing non-linear methods of dimension reduction (methods of elastic maps and principal trees) which extends the classical method of principal components. Also I present application of matrix factorization techniques to analysis of cancer data. The second chapter is devoted to the complexity of mathematical models in molecular biology. I describe the basic ideas of asymptotology of chemical reaction networks aiming at dissecting and simplifying complex chemical kinetics models. Two applications of this approach are presented: to modeling NFkB and apoptosis pathways, and to modeling mechanisms of miRNA action on protein translation. The third chapter briefly describes my investigations of the genome structure in different organisms (from microbes to human cancer genomes). Unsupervised data analysis approaches are used to investigate the patterns in genomic sequences shaped by genome evolution and influenced by the basic properties of the environment. The fourth chapter summarizes my experience in studying cancer by computational methods (through combining integrative data analysis and mathematical modeling approaches). In particular, I describe the on-going research projects such as mathematical modeling of cell fate decisions and synthetic lethal interactions in DNA repair network.

1407.0644,q-bio,"Performance limitations in visual short-term memory (VSTM) tasks have traditionally been explained in terms of resource or capacity limitations. It has been claimed, for example, that VSTM possesses a limited amount of cognitive or neural ""resources"" that can be used to remember a visual display. In this paper, we highlight the potential importance of a previously neglected factor that might contribute significantly to performance limitations in VSTM tasks: namely, a mismatch between the prior expectations and/or the internal noise properties of the visual system based primarily on its adaptation to the statistics of the natural environment and the statistics of the visual stimuli used in most VSTM experiments. We call this 'model mismatch'. Surprisingly, we show that model mismatch alone, without assuming a general resource or capacity limitation, can, in principle, account for some of the main qualitative characteristics of performance limitations observed in VSTM tasks, including: (i) monotonic decline in memory precision with increasing set size; (ii) variability in memory precision across items and trials; and (iii) different set-size dependencies for initial encoding rate and asymptotic precision when the duration of image presentation is varied. We also investigate the consequences of using experimental stimuli that more closely match the prior expectations and/or internal noise properties of the visual system. The results reveal qualitatively very different patterns of behavior for such stimuli, suggesting that researchers should be cautious about generalizing the results of experiments using ecologically unrealistic stimulus statistics to ecologically more realistic stimuli.",14,[],10

For 41 healthy individuals and a patient with ankylosing spondylitis, who undergone treatment, we invariably find power law scaling over several decades and for the first time calculate quantitatively meaningful values of decay exponent.

1409.0906,q-bio,"Variation in the evolutionary process across the sites of nucleotide sequence alignments is well established, and is an increasingly pervasive feature of datasets composed of gene regions sampled from multiple loci and/or different genomes. Inference of phylogeny from these data demands that we adequately model the underlying process heterogeneity; failure to do so can lead to biased estimates of phylogeny and other parameters. Traditionally, process heterogeneity has been accommodated by first assigning sites to data subsets based on relevant prior information (reflecting codon positions in protein-coding DNA, stem and loop regions of ribosomal DNA, etc.), and then estimating the phylogeny and other model parameters under the resulting mixed model. Here, we consider an alternative approach for accommodating process heterogeneity that is similar in spirit to this conventional mixed-model approach. However, rather than treating the partitioning scheme as a fixed assumption of the analysis, we treat the process partition as a random variable using a Dirichlet process prior model, where the phylogeny is estimated by integrating over all possible process partitions for the specified data subsets. We apply this method to simulated and empirical datasets, and compare our results to those estimated previously using conventional mixed-model selection criteria based on Bayes factors. We find that estimation under the Dirichlet process prior model discovers novel process partitions that may more effectively balance error variance and estimation bias, while rendering phylogenetic inference more robust to process heterogeneity by virtue of integrating estimates over all possible partition schemes.

1403.1803,q-bio,"Molecular phenotypes link genomic information with organismic functions, fitness, and evolution. Quantitative traits are complex phenotypes that depend on multiple genomic loci. In this paper, we study the adaptive evolution of a quantitative trait under time-dependent selection, which arises from environmental changes or through fitness interactions with other co-evolving phenotypes. We analyze a model of trait evolution under mutations and genetic drift in a single-peak fitness seascape. The fitness peak performs a constrained random walk in the trait amplitude, which determines the time-dependent trait optimum in a given population. We derive analytical expressions for the distribution of the time-dependent trait divergence between populations and of the trait diversity within populations. Based on this solution, we develop a method to infer adaptive evolution of quantitative traits. Specifically, we show that the ratio of the average trait divergence and the diversity is a universal function of evolutionary time, which predicts the stabilizing strength and the driving rate of the fitness seascape. From an information-theoretic point of view, this function measures the macro-evolutionary entropy in a population ensemble, which determines the predictability of the evolutionary process. Our solution also quantifies two key characteristics of adapting populations: the cumulative fitness flux, which measures the total amount of adaptation, and the adaptive load, which is the fitness cost due to a population's lag behind the fitness peak.",14,[],10
1405.6571,q-bio,"Elucidating the demographic and phylogeographic histories of species provides insight into the processes responsible for generating biological diversity, and genomic datasets are now permitting the estimation of histories and demographic parameters with unprecedented accuracy. We used a genomic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) dataset generated using a RAD-Seq method to investigate the historical demography and phylogeography of a widespread lowland Neotropical bird (Xenops minutus). As expected, we found that prominent landscape features that act as dispersal barriers, such as Amazonian rivers and the Andes Mountains, are associated with the deepest phylogeographic breaks, and also that isolation by distance is limited in areas between these barriers. In addition, we inferred positive population growth for most populations and detected evidence of historical gene flow between populations that are now physically isolated. Even with genomic estimates of historical demographic parameters, we found the prominent diversification hypotheses to be untestable. We conclude that investigations into the multifarious processes shaping species histories, aided by genomic datasets, will provide greater resolution of diversification in the Neotropics, but that future efforts should focus on understanding the processes shaping the histories of lineages rather than trying to reconcile these histories with landscape and climatic events in Earth history.",14,[],10

The comparative studies between mechanisms of uniporter (GLUT1) and symporter (XylE and GlcP) are given. The transitional rates are calculated from the fundamental theory. The monosaccharide transport kinetics is proposed. The steady state of the transporter is found and its stability is studied. The glucose (xylose) translocation rates in two directions and in different steps are compared. The mean transport time in a cycle is calculated and based on it the comparison of the transport times between GLUT1,GlcP and XylE can be drawn.

1410.8207,q-bio,"West Africa is currently experiencing a severe outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD). As part of the international effort to address this outbreak, the United States has committed to building specialized Ebola treatment facilities with 1700 beds. However, the effectiveness of this increase in the available healthcare facilities to treat Ebola is unclear, especially in light of the rapidly increasing number of cases. Adapting a previously validated mathematical model of Ebola in West Africa, we examine the potential impact of an increase in hospital capacity to mitigate the impact of Ebola under several scenarios, ranging from the planned scenario of 1700 beds in 10 weeks to a considerably more aggressive approach of twice the number of beds in 5 weeks. We find that even for the most aggressive scenarios, while increasing the availability of healthcare reduces the number of Ebola cases and slows the outbreak, it is not sufficient to stop the epidemic within the next three months. We find that only a combination of increased hospital beds and a dramatic decrease in the rate of transmission within the community can bring the epidemic under control within the near future.",14,[],10
1407.7080,q-bio,"Given the importance of non-coding RNAs to cellular regulatory functions and rapid growth of RNA transcripts, computational prediction of RNA tertiary structure remains highly demanded yet significantly challenging. Even for a short RNA sequence, the space of tertiary conformations is immense; existing methods to identify native-like conformations mostly resort to random sampling of conformations to gain computational feasibility. However native conformations may not be examined and prediction accuracy may be compromised due to sampling. In particular, the state-of-the-art methods have yet to deliver the desired prediction performance for RNAs of length beyond 50.   This paper presents the work to tackle a key step in the RNA tertiary structure prediction problem, the prediction of the nucleotide interactions that constitute the desired tertiary structure. The research is established upon a novel graph model, called backbone k-tree, to markably constrain nucleotide interaction relationships in RNA tertiary structure. It is shown that the new model makes it possible to efficiently predict the optimal set of nucleotide interactions from the query sequence, including the interactions in all recently revealed families. Evident by the preliminary results, the new method can predict with a high accuracy the nucleotide interactions that constitute the tertiary structure of the query sequence, thus providing a viable solution towards ab initio prediction of RNA tertiary structure.",14,[],10
1404.7766,q-bio,"Introgressions from Neanderthals and Denisovans were detected in modern humans. Introgressions from other archaic hominins were also implicated, however, identification of which poses a great technical challenge. Here, we introduced an approach in identifying introgressions from all possible archaic hominins in Eurasian genomes, without referring to archaic hominin sequences. We focused on mutations emerged in archaic hominins after their divergence from modern humans (denoted as archaic-specific mutations), and identified introgressive segments which showed significant enrichment of archaic-specific mutations over the rest of the genome. Furthermore, boundaries of introgressions were identified using a dynamic programming approach to partition whole genome into segments which contained different levels of archaic-specific mutations. We found that detected introgressions shared more archaic-specific mutations with Altai Neanderthal than they shared with Denisovan, and 60.3% of archaic hominin introgressions were from Neanderthals. Furthermore, we detected more introgressions from two unknown archaic hominins whom diverged with modern humans approximately 859 and 3,464 thousand years ago. The latter unknown archaic hominin contributed to the genomes of the common ancestors of modern humans and Neanderthals. In total, archaic hominin introgressions comprised 2.4% of Eurasian genomes.

The model predicts that the optimal decision must take into account not only the expected potential for reproductive growth, but also the uncertainty in that expected potential.

The presence of viable but non-culturable (VBNC) organisms is also a potential problem with Salmonella detection when using conventional techniques. In this study, the molecular approach for organism recognition, known as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), was used for characterisation the Salmonella spp. used as inoculums in composting. This study also provides a better understand about selecting the suitable primer for Salmonella spp. The specificity of the probes and primers at the species level were verified by performing NCBI-BLAST2 (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool). Primers that target the invA gene for Salmonella were selected which produce fragment lengths around 285bp (shown in Figure 1). The Salmonella spp. solutions were tested and proved contained the sequences of invA gene by using several steps of molecular techniques before used it as inoculums in composting. The laboratory scale batch composting reactors were used to examine the inactivation of Salmonella spp. The inoculate solution of Salmonella was prepared by culturing Salmonella enteritidis (ATCC13076) in tryptone broth solution for 24 hours before adding it directly into the compost material. The reduction rate of Salmonella spp. was enumerated by conventional method accordingly to the standard compost guidelines (Figure 2).

1404.4755,q-bio,"A major theme in constraint-based modeling is unifying experimental data, such as biochemical information about the reactions that can occur in a system or the composition and localization of enzyme complexes, with highthroughput data including expression data, metabolomics, or DNA sequencing. The desired result is to increase predictive capability resulting in improved understanding of metabolism. The approach typically employed when only gene (or protein) intensities are available is the creation of tissue-specific models, which reduces the available reactions in an organism model, and does not provide an objective function for the estimation of fluxes, which is an important limitation in many modeling applications. We develop a method, flux assignment with LAD (least absolute deviation) convex objectives and normalization (FALCON), that employs metabolic network reconstructions along with expression data to estimate fluxes. In order to use such a method, accurate measures of enzyme complex abundance are needed, so we first present a new algorithm that addresses quantification of complex abundance. Our extensions to prior techniques include the capability to work with large models and significantly improved run-time performance even for smaller models, an improved analysis of enzyme complex formation logic, the ability to handle very large enzyme complex rules that may incorporate multiple isoforms, and depending on the model constraints, either maintained or significantly improved correlation with experimentally measured fluxes. FALCON has been implemented in MATLAB and ATS, and can be downloaded from: https://github.com/bbarker/FALCON.

Here, we used a barrier-based protocol that allows for making large arrays of well-controlled circular model wounds within an epithelium at confluence, without injuring any cells. We propose a physical model that takes into account border forces, friction with the substrate, and tissue rheology. Despite the presence of a contractile actomyosin cable at the periphery of the wound, epithelization was mostly driven by border protrusive activity. Closure dynamics was quantified by an epithelization coefficient equation defined as the ratio of the border protrusive stress equation to the friction coefficient equation between epithelium and substrate.

The model was extended to describe growth of E. coli in unsaturated porous media, combining diffusion, phase exchange and microbiological growth. Experiments in a Hele-Shaw cell, filled with quartz sand, were conducted to study bacterial growth in the capillary fringe above a saturated porous medium. Cell density profiles in the Hele-Shaw cell were predicted with the growth model and the parameters from the batch experiments without any further calibration.

We dubbed these 10 structural motifs ""binary switches"" as they display molecular interactions that switch between two distinct states. By projecting the receptor dynamics on these binary switches that yield equation microstates, we show that (i) the receptors in apo, antagonist-bound, and agonist-bound states explore vastly different conformational space; (ii) among the three receptor states the apo state explores the broadest range of microstates; (iii) in the presence of the agonist, the active conformation is maintained through coherent couplings among the binary switches; and (iv) to be most specific, our analysis shows that W246, located deep inside the binding cleft, can serve as both an agonist sensor and actuator of ensuing intramolecular signaling for the receptor activation.Finally, our analysis of multiple trajectories generated by inserting an agonist to the apo state underscores that the transition of the receptor from inactive to active form requires the disruption of ionic-lock in the DRY motif.",14,[],10
1404.5515,q-bio,"In the applications of Boolean networks to modeling biological systems, an important computational problem is the detection of the fixed points of these networks.

We show that any system of Boolean equations is equivalent to one Boolean equation, and thus it is possible to divide the polynomial equation system which defines the fixed points of a Boolean network into subsystems that can be solved easily. After solving these subsystems and thus reducing the number of states, we can combine the solutions to obtain all fixed points of the given network.

Simulational studies have shown that coherent oscillations give rise to windows in time during which information transfer can be enhanced in neuronal networks. Unanswered questions are: 1) What is the transfer mechanism? And 2) how well can a transfer be executed? Here, we present a pulse-based mechanism by which graded current amplitudes may be exactly propagated from one neuronal population to another. The mechanism relies on the downstream gating of mean synaptic current amplitude from one population of neurons to another via a pulse. Because transfer is pulse-based, information may be dynamically routed through a neural circuit. We demonstrate the amplitude transfer mechanism in a realistic network of spiking neurons and show that it is robust to noise in the form of pulse timing inaccuracies, random synaptic strengths and finite size effects. In finding an exact, analytical solution to a fundamental problem of information coding in the brain, graded information transfer, we have isolated a basic mechanism that may be used as a building block for fast, complex information processing in neural circuits.",14,[],10

Symmetry in distribution of mass, hydrophobicity, polarizability recorded very similar extents in Ig and in structurally-closest non-Ig structures. They registered similar symmetries in dipole-dipole, letter-letter, cation-letter cloud interactions and also in distribution of active chiral centers, charged residues and hydrophobic residues. But in contrast to non-Ig proteins, extents of residual interaction symmetries in Ig.s of largely varying sizes are found to converge to exactly same magnitude of correlation dimension - these are named 'structural attractors', who's weightages depend on ensuring exact convergence of pairwise-interaction symmetries to attractor magnitude.

1402.0757,q-bio,"Cancer cells are known to modify their micro-environment such that it can sustain a larger population, or, in ecological terms, they construct a niche which increases the carrying capacity of the population. It has however been argued that niche construction, which benefits all cells in the tumour, would be selected against since cheaters could reap the benefits without paying the cost. We have investigated the impact of niche specificity on tumour evolution using an individual based model of breast tumour growth, in which the carrying capacity of each cell consists of two components: an intrinsic, subclone-specific part and a contribution from all neighbouring cells. Analysis of the model shows that the ability of a mutant to invade a resident population depends strongly on the specificity. When specificity is low selection is mostly on growth rate, while high specificity shifts selection towards increased carrying capacity. Further, we show that the long-term evolution of the system can be predicted using adaptive dynamics. By comparing the results from a spatially structured vs.\ well-mixed population we show that spatial structure restores selection for carrying capacity even at zero specificity, which a poses solution to the niche construction dilemma. Lastly, we show that an expanding population exhibits spatially variable selection pressure, where cells at the leading edge exhibit higher growth rate and lower carrying capacity than those at the centre of the tumour.",14,[],10
1401.5248,q-bio,"Population genetics theory has laid the foundations for genomics analyses including the recent burst in genome scans for selection and statistical inference of past demographic events in many prokaryote, animal and plant species. Identifying SNPs under natural selection and underpinning species adaptation relies on disentangling the respective contribution of random processes (mutation, drift, migration) from that of selection on nucleotide variability. Most theory and statistical tests have been developed using the Kingman coalescent theory based on the Wright-Fisher population model. However, these theoretical models rely on biological and life-history assumptions which may be violated in many prokaryote, fungal, animal or plant species. Recent theoretical developments of the so called multiple merger coalescent models are reviewed here (letter-coalescent, beta-coalescent, Bolthausen-Snitzman, letter-coalescent). We explicit how these new models take into account various pervasive ecological and biological characteristics, life history traits or life cycles which were not accounted in previous theories such as 1) the skew in offspring production typical of marine species, 2) fast adapting microparasites (virus, bacteria and fungi) exhibiting large variation in population sizes during epidemics, 3) the peculiar life cycles of fungi and bacteria alternating sexual and asexual cycles, and 4) the high rates of extinction-recolonization in spatially structured populations. We finally discuss the relevance of multiple merger models for the detection of SNPs under selection in these species, for population genomics of very large sample size and advocate to potentially examine the conclusion of previous population genetics studies.",14,[],10
1406.0212,q-bio,"Size-structured population models provide a popular means to mathematically describe phenomena such as bacterial aggregation, schooling fish, and planetesimal evolution. For parameter estimation, generalized sensitivity functions (GSFs) provide a tool that quantifies the impact of data from specific regions of the experimental domain. These functions help identify the most relevant data subdomains, which enhances the optimization of experimental design. To our knowledge, GSFs have not been used in the partial differential equation (PDE) realm, so we provide a novel PDE extension of the discrete and continuous ordinary differential equation (ODE) concepts of Thomaseth and Cobelli and Banks et al. respectively. We analyze the GSFs in the context of size-structured population models, and specifically analyze the Smoluchowski coagulation equation to determine the most relevant time and volume domains for three, distinct aggregation kernels. Finally, we provide evidence that parameter estimation for the Smoluchowski coagulation equation does not require post-gelation data.",14,[],10
1407.3880,q-bio,"The Yule-Harding-Kingman (YHK) model and the proportional to distinguishable arrangements (PDA) model are two binary tree generating models that are widely used in evolutionary biology. Understanding the distributions of clade sizes under these two models provides valuable insights into macro-evolutionary processes, and is important in hypothesis testing and Bayesian analyses in phylogenetics. Here we show that these distributions are log-convex, which implies that very large clades or very small clades are more likely to occur under these two models. Moreover, we prove that there exists a critical value equation for each equation such that for a given clade with size equation, the probability that this clade is contained in a random tree with equation leaves generated under the YHK model is higher than that under the PDA model if equation, and lower if equation. Finally, we extend our results to binary unrooted trees, and obtain similar results for the distributions of clan sizes.",14,[],10

The steps at which splicing can be regulated remain largely unknown. We systematically analyzed the effect of knocking down the components of the splicing machinery on alternative splicing events relevant for cell proliferation and apoptosis and used this information to reconstruct a network of functional interactions. The network accurately captures known physical and functional associations and identifies new ones, revealing remarkable regulatory potential of core spliceosomal components, related to the order and duration of their recruitment during spliceosome assembly. In contrast with standard models of regulation at early steps of splice site recognition, factors involved in catalytic activation of the spliceosome display regulatory properties. The network also sheds light on the antagonism between hnRNP C and U2AF, and on targets of antitumor drugs, and can be widely used to identify mechanisms of splicing regulation.",14,[],10

We identify thousands of genes that are differentially expressed across tissues in D. yakuba and D. simulans, with roughly 60% agreement in expression patterns of orthologs in D. yakuba and D. simulans. We identify several cases of putative polycistronic transcripts, pointing to a combination of transcriptional read-through in the genome as well as putative gene fusion and fission events across taxa.

1406.3067,q-bio,"A central challenge in the study of protein evolution is the identification of historic amino acid sequence changes responsible for creating novel functions observed in present-day proteins. To address this problem, we developed a new method to identify and rank amino acid mutations in ancestral protein sequences according to their function-shifting potential. Our approach scans the changes between two reconstructed ancestral sequences in order to find (1) sites with sequence changes that significantly deviate from our model-based probabilistic expectations, (2) sites that demonstrate extreme changes in mutual information, and (3) sites with extreme gains or losses of information content. By taking the overlaps of these statistical signals, the method accurately identifies cryptic evolutionary patterns that are often not obvious when examining only the conservation of modern-day protein sequences. We validated this method with a training set of previously-discovered function-shifting mutations in three essential protein families in animals and fungi, whose evolutionary histories were the prior subject of systematic molecular biological investigation. Our method identified the known function-shifting mutations in the training set with a very low rate of false positive discovery. Further, our approach significantly outperformed other methods that use variability in evolutionary rates to detect functional loci. The accuracy of our approach indicates it could be a useful tool for generating specific testable hypotheses regarding the acquisition of new functions across a wide range of protein families.",14,[],10
1405.1206,q-bio,"The different cell types in a living organism acquire their identity through the process of cell differentiation in which the multipotent progenitor cells differentiate into distinct cell types. Experimental evidence and analysis of large-scale microarray data establish the key role played by a two-gene motif in cell differentiation in a number of cell systems. The two genes express transcription factors which repress each other's expression and autoactivate their own production. A number of theoretical models have recently been proposed based on the two-gene motif to provide a physical understanding of how cell differentiation occurs. In this paper, we study a simple model of cell differentiation which assumes no cooperativity in the regulation of gene expression by the transcription factors. The latter repress each other's activity directly through DNA binding and indirectly through the formation of heterodimers. We specifically investigate how deterministic processes combined with stochasticity contribute in bringing about cell differentiation. The deterministic dynamics of our model give rise to a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation from an undifferentiated stable steady state to two differentiated stable steady states. The stochastic dynamics of our model are studied using the approaches based on the Langevin equations and the linear noise approximation. The simulation results provide a new physical understanding of recent experimental observations. We further propose experimental measurements of quantities like the variance and the lag-1 autocorrelation function in protein fluctuations as the early signatures of an approaching bifurcation point in the cell differentiation process.",14,[],10
1412.2779,q-bio,"Proteins are the most important biomolecules for living organisms. The understanding of protein structure, function, dynamics and transport is one of most challenging tasks in biological science. In the present work, persistent homology is, for the first time, introduced for extracting molecular topological fingerprints (MTFs) based on the persistence of molecular topological invariants. MTFs are utilized for protein characterization, identification and classification. The method of slicing is proposed to track the geometric origin of protein topological invariants. Both all-atom and coarse-grained representations of MTFs are constructed. A new cutoff-like filtration is proposed to shed light on the optimal cutoff distance in elastic network models. Based on the correlation between protein compactness, rigidity and connectivity, we propose an accumulated bar length generated from persistent topological invariants for the quantitative modeling of protein flexibility. To this end, a correlation matrix based filtration is developed. This approach gives rise to an accurate prediction of the optimal characteristic distance used in protein B-factor analysis. Finally, MTFs are employed to characterize protein topological evolution during protein folding and quantitatively predict the protein folding stability. An excellent consistence between our persistent homology prediction and molecular dynamics simulation is found. This work reveals the topology-function relationship of proteins.",14,[],10

Here we integrate depictions of mammals from Egyptian antiquity with direct lines of paleontological and archeological evidence to infer local extinctions and community dynamics over a 6000-year span. The unprecedented temporal resolution of this data set enables examination of how the tandem effects of human population growth and climate change can disrupt mammalian communities. We show that the extinctions of mammals in Egypt were nonrandom, and that destabilizing changes in community composition coincided with abrupt aridification events and the attendant collapses of some complex societies. We also show that the roles of species in a community can change over time, and that persistence is predicted by measures of species sensitivity, a function of local dynamic stability.

1409.4976,q-bio,"HIF (Hypoxia Inducible Factor) is an oxygen-regulated transcription factor that mediates the intracellular response to hypoxia in human cells. There is increasing evidence that cell signaling pathways encode temporal information, and thus cell fate may be determined by the dynamics of protein levels. We have developed a mathematical model to describe the transient dynamics of the HIF-1\alpha protein measured in single cells subjected to hypoxic shock. The essential characteristics of these data are modeled with a system of differential equations describing the feedback inhibition between HIF-1\alpha and Prolyl Hydroxylases (PHD) oxygen sensors. Heterogeneity in the single-cell data is accounted for through parameter variation in the model. We previously identified the PHD2 isoform as the main PHD responsible for controlling the HIF-1\alpha transient response, and make here testable predictions regarding HIF-1\alpha dynamics subject to repetitive hypoxic pulses. The model is further developed to describe the dynamics of HIF-1\alpha in cells cultured as 3D spheroids, with oxygen dynamics parameterized using experimental measurements of oxygen within spheroids. We show that the dynamics of HIF-1\alpha and transcriptional targets of HIF-1\alpha display a non-monotone response to the oxygen dynamics. Specifically we demonstrate that the dynamic transient behavior of HIF-1\alpha results in differential dynamics in transcriptional targets.",14,[],10
1404.5516,q-bio,"To model biological systems using networks, it is desirable to allow more than two levels of expression for the nodes and to allow the introduction of parameters. Various modeling and simulation methods addressing these needs using Boolean models, both synchronous and asynchronous, have been proposed in the literature. However, analytical study of these more general Boolean networks models is lagging. This paper aims to develop a concise theory for these different Boolean logic based modeling methods. Boolean models for networks where each node can have more than two levels of expression and Boolean models with parameters are defined algebraically with examples provided. Certain classes of random asynchronous Boolean networks and deterministic moduli asynchronous Boolean networks are investigated in detail using the setting introduced in this paper. The derived theorems provide a clear picture for the attractor structures of these asynchronous Boolean networks.",14,[],10
1404.6836,q-bio,"Neural systems are comprised of interacting units, and relevant information regarding their function or malfunction can be inferred by analyzing the statistical dependencies between the activity of each unit. Whilst correlations and mutual information are commonly used to characterize these dependencies, our objective here is to extend interactions to triplets of variables to better detect and characterize dynamic information transfer. Our approach relies on the measure of interaction information (II). The sign of II provides information as to the extent to which the interaction of variables in triplets is redundant (R) or synergetic (S). Here, based on this approach, we calculated the R and S status for triplets of electrophysiological data recorded from drug-resistant patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy in order to study the spatial organization and dynamics of R and S close to the epileptogenic zone (the area responsible for seizure propagation). In terms of spatial organization, our results show that R matched the epileptogenic zone while S was distributed more in the surrounding area. In relation to dynamics, R made the largest contribution to high frequency bands (14-100Hz), whilst S was expressed more strongly at lower frequencies (1-7Hz). Thus, applying interaction information to such clinical data reveals new aspects of epileptogenic structure in terms of the nature (redundancy vs. synergy) and dynamics (fast vs. slow rhythms) of the interactions. We expect this methodology, robust and simple, can reveal new aspects beyond pair-interactions in networks of interacting units in other setups with multi-recording data sets (and thus, not necessarily in epilepsy, the pathology we have approached here).",14,[],10
1407.6525,q-bio,"Precise spatio-temporal patterns of neuronal action potentials underly e.g. sensory representations and control of muscle activities. However, it is not known how the synaptic efficacies in the neuronal networks of the brain adapt such that they can reliably generate spikes at specific points in time. Existing activity-dependent plasticity rules like Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity are agnostic to the goal of learning spike times. On the other hand, the existing formal and supervised learning algorithms perform a temporally precise comparison of projected activity with the target, but there is no known biologically plausible implementation of this comparison. Here, we propose a simple and local unsupervised synaptic plasticity mechanism that is derived from the requirement of a balanced membrane potential. Since the relevant signal for synaptic change is the postsynaptic voltage rather than spike times, we call the plasticity rule Membrane Potential Dependent Plasticity (MPDP). Combining our plasticity mechanism with spike after-hyperpolarization causes a sensitivity of synaptic change to pre- and postsynaptic spike times which can reproduce Hebbian spike timing dependent plasticity for inhibitory synapses as was found in experiments. In addition, the sensitivity of MPDP to the time course of the voltage when generating a spike allows MPDP to distinguish between weak (spurious) and strong (teacher) spikes, which therefore provides a neuronal basis for the comparison of actual and target activity. For spatio-temporal input spike patterns our conceptually simple plasticity rule achieves a surprisingly high storage capacity for spike associations. The sensitivity of the MPDP to the subthreshold membrane potential during training allows robust memory retrieval after learning even in the presence of activity corrupted by noise.",14,[],10

Although detecting cis-eQTLs is now routine, trans-eQTLs have proven more challenging to find due to the modest variance explained and the multiple tests burden of testing millions of SNPs for association to thousands of transcripts. Here, we successfully map trans-eQTLs with the complementary approach of looking for SNPs associated to the expression of multiple genes simultaneously. We find 732 trans- eQTLs that replicate across two continental populations; each trans-eQTL controls large groups of target transcripts (regulons), which are part of interacting networks controlled by transcription factors. We are thus able to uncover co-regulated gene sets and begin describing the cell circuitry of gene regulation.",14,[],10
1403.4223,q-bio,"Efforts to reconstruct phylogenetic trees and understand evolutionary processes depend fundamentally on stochastic models of speciation and mutation. The simplest continuous-time model for speciation in phylogenetic trees is the Yule process, in which new species are ""born"" from existing lineages at a constant rate. Recent work has illuminated some of the structural properties of Yule trees, but it remains mostly unknown how these properties affect sequence and trait patterns observed at the tips of the phylogenetic tree. Understanding the interplay between speciation and mutation under simple models of evolution is essential for deriving valid phylogenetic inference methods and gives insight into the optimal design of phylogenetic studies. In this work, we derive the probability distribution of interspecies covariance under Brownian motion and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models of phenotypic change on a Yule tree. We compute the probability distribution of the number of mutations shared between two randomly chosen taxa in a Yule tree under discrete Markov mutation models. Our results suggest summary measures of phylogenetic information content, illuminate the correlation between site patterns in sequences or traits of related organisms, and provide heuristics for experimental design and reconstruction of phylogenetic trees.",14,[],10

We find that increasing the number of loner strategies (or equivalently increasing mutational bias toward loner strategies) facilitates evolution of cooperation both in well-mixed and in structured populations.

1402.0850,q-bio,"The detection of somatic single nucleotide variants is a crucial component to the characterization of the cancer genome. Mutation calling algorithms thus far have focused on comparing the normal and tumor genomes from the same individual. In recent years, it has become routine for projects like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to also sequence the tumor RNA. Here we present RADIA (RNA and DNA Integrated Analysis), a method that combines the patient-matched normal and tumor DNA with the tumor RNA to detect somatic mutations. The inclusion of the RNA increases the power to detect somatic mutations, especially at low DNA allelic frequencies. By integrating the DNA and RNA, we are able to rescue back calls that would be missed by traditional mutation calling algorithms that only examine the DNA.   RADIA was developed for the identification of somatic mutations using both DNA and RNA from the same individual. We demonstrate high sensitivity (84%) and very high specificity (98% and 99%) in real data from endometrial carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma from TCGA. Mutations with both high DNA and RNA read support have the highest validation rate of over 99%. We also introduce a simulation package that spikes in artificial mutations to real data, rather than simulating sequencing data from a reference genome. We evaluate sensitivity on the simulation data and demonstrate our ability to rescue back calls at low DNA allelic frequencies by including the RNA. Finally, we highlight mutations in important cancer genes that were rescued back due to the incorporation of the RNA.   Software available at https://github.com/aradenbaugh/radia/",14,[],10

Repeated use of this protocol for each spatial axis of Alice allows transfer of a complete 3-dimensional reference frame, up to inversion of each of the axes.

1411.1866,quant-ph,"Negative values of the Casimir entropy occur quite frequently at low temperatures in arrangements of metallic objects. The physical reason lies either in the dissipative nature of the metals as is the case for the plane-plane geometry or in the geometric form of the objects involved. Examples for the latter are the sphere-plane and the sphere-sphere geometry, where negative Casimir entropies can occur already for perfect metal objects. After appropriately scaling out the size of the objects, negative Casimir entropies of geometric origin are particularly pronounced in the limit of large distances between the objects. We analyze this limit in terms of the different scattering channels and demonstrate how the negativity of the Casimir entropy is related to the polarization mixing arising in the scattering process. If all involved objects have a finite zero-frequency conductivity, the channels involving transverse electric modes are suppressed and the Casimir entropy within the large-distance limit is found to be positive.",14,[],6

While they measured the correct weak values for the quantum Cheshire Cat interpretation, the corresponding implications do not obtain because, as we show, those weak values were measured with both a quadratic and a linear magnetic field Bz interaction. We show explicitly how those weak values imply quantum Cheshire Cat if the Bz interaction is linear and then we show how the quadratic Bz interaction destroys the quantum Cheshire Cat implications of those weak values. Since both linear and quadratic Bz interactions contribute equally to the neutron intensity in this experiment, the deviant weak value implications are unavoidable.

Contrary to what is commonly assumed, the NSEs are not the weak-field (WF), non-relativistic (NR) limit of the semi-classical Einstein equation (SCE) (this nomenclature is preferred over the `M\/oller-Rosenfeld equation') based on GRQFT. The wave-function in the NSEs makes sense only as that for a mean field describing a system of equation particles as equation, not that of a single or finite many particles. From GRQFT the gravitational self-interaction leads to mass renormalization, not to a non-linear term in the evolution equations of some AQTs. The WF-NR limit of the gravitational interaction in GRQFT involves no dynamics. To see the contrast, we give a derivation of the equation (i) governing the many-body wave function from GRQFT and (ii) for the non-relativistic limit of quantum electrodynamics (QED). They have the same structure, being linear, and very different from NSEs. Adding to this our earlier consideration that for gravitational decoherence the master equations based on GRQFT lead to decoherence in the energy basis and not in the position basis, despite some AQTs desiring it for the `collapse of the wave function', we conclude that the origins and consequences of NSEs are very different, and should be clearly demarcated from those of the SCE equation, the only legitimate representative of semiclassical gravity, based on GRQFT.",14,[],6

1410.7079,quant-ph,"Explaining how microscopic entities collectively produce macroscopic phenomena is a fundamental goal of many-body physics. Theory predicts that large-scale entanglement is responsible for exotic macroscopic phenomena, but observation of entangled particles in naturally occurring systems is extremely challenging. Synthetic quantum systems made of atoms in optical lattices have been con- structed with the goal of observing macroscopic quantum phenomena with single-atom resolution. Serious challenges remain in producing and detecting long-range quantum correlations in these systems, however. Here we exploit the strengths of photonic technology, including high coherence and efficient single-particle detection, to study the predicted large-scale entanglement underlying the macroscopic quantum phenomenon of polarization squeezing. We generate a polarization-squeezed beam, extract photon pairs at random, and make a tomographic reconstruction of their joint quantum state. We present experimental evidence showing that all photons arriving within the squeezing coherence time are entangled, that entanglement monogamy dilutes entanglement with increasing photon density and that, counterintuitively, increased squeezing can reduce bipartite entanglement. The results provide direct evidence for entanglement of macroscopic numbers of particles and introduce micro-analysis to the study of macroscopic quantum phenomena.",14,[],6

The interaction between the systems is mediated by a light field which allows to couple the two systems in a modular way over long distances. Coupling to internal degrees of freedom of atoms opens up the possibility to employ high-frequency mechanical resonators in the MHz to GHz regime, such as optomechanical crystal structures, and to benefit from the rich toolbox of quantum control over internal atomic states. Previous schemes involving atomic motional states are rather limited in both of these aspects. We derive a full quantum model for the effective coupling including the main sources of decoherence.

A group of random phase unitary operators is introduced further to obtain an exact quotient space for the observed system. In this quotient space, a density matrix can be constructed to give the Born's probability rule, realizing a (non-dynamical) decoherence.

Control of entangled states on a couple of atoms, ions or quantum dots are milestones in almost all quantum applications towards a scalable spin-based quantum computers or quantum devices. For magnetic systems, Ising model is an interaction which generates and modifies entanglement properties of quantum systems based on matter. In addition, when this interaction includes driven magnetic fields, it can be controlled to sustain, characterize or modify entanglement and other quantum properties. In this work, recent results about evolution in a general anisotropic three dimensional Ising model including an inhomogeneous magnetic field is considered to obtain some general quantum control effects for their sustainability, programmed evolution or transformation: Evolution loops and Exchange operations.

Because the scheme is based on the resonant interaction, the time required to generate entangle- ment is greatly shortened. Since the fields remain in vacuum state and all the atoms are in the ground states, the losses due to the excitation of photons and the spon- taneous transition of atoms are suppressed efficiently compared with the dispersive protocols.

1405.2825,quant-ph,"The following issues are discussed inspired by the recent paper of Kadanoff (arXiv: 1403:6162): (a) Construction of a generalized one-particle Wigner distribution (GWD) function (analog of the classical distribution function) from which the quantum kinetic equation due to Kadanoff and Baym (KB) is derived, often called the Quantum Boltzmann Equation (QBE); (b) The equation obeyed by this has a collision contribution in the form of a two-particle Green function. This term is manipulated to have Kinetic Entropy in parallel to its counterpart in the classical Boltzmann kinetic equation for the classical distribution function. This proved to be problematic in that unlike in the classical Boltzmann kinetic equation, the contribution from the kinetic entropy term was non-positive; (3) Kadanoff surmised that this situation could perhaps be related to quantum entanglement that may not have been included in his theory. It is shown that GWD is not positive everywhere (indicating dynamical quantumness) just like the commonly recognized property of the Wigner function (negative property indicating quantumness of the state). The issue of non-positive feature appearing in approximate evaluation of patently positive entities in many particle systems is here pointed to an early discussion of this issue (Phys. Rev. A10, 1852 (1974)) in terms of a theorem on truncation of cumulant expansion of a probability distribution function due to Marcinkeiwicz. The last issue of presence or absence of entanglement in an approximate evaluation of a many particle correlation poses a new problem; it is considered here in terms of fermionic entanglement theory in the light of density matrix and Green function theory of many-fermion systems. The clue comes from the fact that the Hartree-Fock approximation exhbits no entantanglement in two-particle fermion density matrix and hence also in two-particle Green function.",14,[],6

As an established tool to subdue noise, quantum error correction is unfortunately overprotective because the quantum enhancement can still be achieved even if the states are irrecoverably affected, provided that the quantum Fisher information, which sets the ultimate limit to the precision of metrological schemes, is preserved and attained. Here, we develop a theory of robust metrological schemes that preserve the quantum Fisher information instead of the quantum states themselves against noise. After deriving a minimal set of testable conditions on this kind of robustness, we construct a family of equation qubits metrological schemes being immune to equation-qubit errors after the signal sensing.

We establish a link between the combinatorial notion of orthogonal arrays and k-uniform states and prove the existence of several new classes of such states for N-qudit systems. In particular, known Hadamard matrices allow us to explicitly construct 2-uniform states for an arbitrary number of N>5 qubits. We show that finding a different class of 2-uniform states would imply the Hadamard conjecture, so the full classification of 2-uniform states seems to be currently out of reach.

1411.5704,quant-ph,"The strong experimental evidence for the violation of Bell's inequalities is widely interpreted as the ultimate proof of the impossibility to describe Bell's polarization states of two entangled particles in terms of a local and realistic statistical model of hidden variables in which the observers are free to choose the settings of their measurements. In this paper we note, however, that Bell's theorem relies crucially on a fourth implicit theoretical assumption, in addition to the explicit hypotheses of locality, physical realism and 'free will'. Namely, we note that the proof of Bell's inequalities for generic models of hidden variables implicitly assumes that there exists an absolute reference frame of angular coordinates, with respect to which we can define the polarization properties of the hidden configurations of the pair of particles. This implicit additional assumption, however, is not required by any fundamental physical principle and, indeed, it may be incorrect if the hidden configuration of the pair of entangled particles breaks the rotational symmetry along an otherwise arbitrary direction. We explicitly show that by giving up to this additional implicit assumption it is possible to build a local and realistic model of hidden variables for Bell's polarization states, which complies with the demands of 'free-will' and fully reproduces the quantum mechanical predictions.

1407.1071,quant-ph,"Ion Coulomb crystals are currently establishing themselves as a highly controllable test-bed for mesoscopic systems of statistical mechanics. The detailed experimental interrogation of the dynamics of these crystals however remains an experimental challenge. In this work, we show how to extend the concepts of multi-dimensional nonlinear spectroscopy to the study of the dynamics of ion Coulomb crystals. The scheme we present can be realized with state-of-the-art technology and gives direct access to the dynamics, revealing nonlinear couplings even in the presence of thermal excitations. We illustrate the advantages of our proposal showing how two-dimensional spectroscopy can be used to detect signatures of a structural phase transition of the ion crystal, as well as resonant energy exchange between modes. Furthermore, we demonstrate in these examples how different decoherence mechanisms can be identified.",14,[],6
1401.7412,quant-ph,"We present a method of developing analytical measures of equation-partite delocalization in arbitrary equation-body W-like states, otherwise known as mixed states in the single excitation subspace. These measures calculate the distance of a state to its closest reference state with equation entanglement. We find that the reference state is determined by the purity of the state undergoing measurement. Measures with up to 6-body delocalization for a 6-body system are derived in full, while an algorithm for general equation-partite measures is given.",14,[],6
1406.6282,quant-ph,"The second order N-dimensional Schrodinger equation with Mie-type potentials is reduced to a first order differential equation by using the Laplace transformation. Exact bound state solutions are obtained using convolution or Faltungs theorem. The Ladder operators are also constructed for the Mie-type potentials in N- dimensions. Lie algebra associated with these operators are studied and it is found that they satisfy the commutation relations for the SU(1,1) group.",14,[],6
1407.6087,quant-ph,"Local realism has been knocked down by the experiments with entangled pairs of particles based on Bell's theorem(J. S. Bell, Physics (Long Island City, N.Y.) 1, 195 (1964)). However, there has been continuing debate on whether locality or realism is the problem. In this work, we analyzed the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment of Bohm's version using information theory and thermodynamics. The inference of non-locality from EPR experiments will be against the principle of non-realism of quantum mechanics. Therefore, the experiments about quantum entanglement cannot provide any proof to accuse locality.",14,[],6
1402.0129,quant-ph,"We analyze entropic uncertainty relations in a finite dimensional Hilbert space and derive several strong bounds for the sum of two entropies obtained in projective measurements with respect to any two orthogonal bases. We improve the recent bounds by Coles and Piani, which are known to be stronger than the well known result of Maassen and Uffink. Furthermore, we find a novel bound based on majorization techniques, which also happens to be stronger than the recent results involving largest singular values of submatrices of the unitary matrix connecting both bases. The first set of new bounds give better results for unitary matrices close to the Fourier matrix, while the second one provides a significant improvement in the opposite sectors. Some results derived admit generalization to arbitrary mixed states, so that corresponding bounds are increased by the von Neumann entropy of the measured state. The majorization approach is finally extended to the case of several measurements.",14,[],6
1404.2908,quant-ph,"The covariance of the Schrodinger equation under Galilei boosts and the compatibility of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics with Einstein's equivalence principle have been constrained for so long to the existence of a superselection rule which would prevent a quantum particle from being found in superposition states of different masses. In an effort to avoid this expedient, and thus allow nonrelativistic quantum mechanics to account for unstable particles, recent works have suggested that the usual Galilean transformations are inconsistent with the nonrelativistic limit implied by the Lorentz transformation. Here we approach the issue in a fundamentally different way. Using a formalism of unitary transformations and employing quantum reference frames rather than immaterial coordinate systems, we show that the Schrodinger equation, although form variant, is fully compatible with the aforementioned principles of relativity.",14,[],6
1406.2170,quant-ph,"We give an algorithm which produces a unique element of the Clifford group Cn on n qubits from an integer 0\le i < Cn (the number of elements in the group). The algorithm involves O(n3) operations. It is a variant of the subgroup algorithm by Diaconis and Shahshahani which is commonly applied to compact Lie groups. We provide an adaption for the symplectic group Sp(2n,F2) which provides, in addition to a canonical mapping from the integers to group elements g, a factorization of g into a sequence of at most 4n symplectic transvections. The algorithm can be used to efficiently select randomelements of Cn which is often useful in quantum information theory and quantum computation. We also give an algorithm for the inverse map, indexing a group element in time O(n3).",14,[],6
1402.3872,quant-ph,"We study quantum effects in hybrid atomic optomechanics in a system comprising a cloud of atoms and a mobile mirror mediated by a single-mode cavity. Tripartite nonlocality is observed in the atom-light-mirror system, as demonstrated by the violation of the Mermin-Klyshko (MK) inequality. It has been shown [C. Genes, et al., PRA 77, 050307 (R) (2008)] that tripartite entanglement is optimized when the cavity is resonant with the anti-Stokes sideband of the driving laser and the atomic frequency matches the Stokes one. However, we show that this is not the case for the nonlocality. The MK function achieves \it minima when the atoms are resonant with both the Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands, and unexpectedly, we find violation of the MK inequality only in a parameter region where entanglement is far from being maximum. A negative relation exists between nonlocality and entanglement with consideration of the possibility of bipartite nonlocality in the violation of the MK inequality. We also study the non-classicality of the mirror by post-selected measurements, e.g. Geiger-like detection, on the cavity and/or the atoms. We show that with feasible parameters Geiger-like detection on the atoms can effectively induce mechanical non-classicality.",14,[],6
1406.1328,quant-ph,"Bragg diffraction is comparable to a hard-wall reflection if the Bragg condition is exactly fulfilled. However, in a neutron interferometer in the gravitational field (COW experiment) this is not the case and the momentum transfers should not be described by hard wall reflection, as it has been done in the commented article. Instead, and quite similar to the atom case, each mirror or beam splitter creates a constant momentum transfer given by the reciprocal lattice vector of the Bragg crystal. To lowest order there are no differences between the atom and the neutron case.",14,[],6
1406.5812,quant-ph,"Hardy's paradox is of fundamental importance in quantum information theory. So far, there have been two types of its extensions into higher dimensions: in the first type the maximum probability of nonlocal events is roughly equation and remains the same as the dimension changes (dimension-independent), while in the second type the probability becomes larger as the dimension increases, reaching approximately equation in the infinite limit. Here, we (i) give an alternative proof of the first type, (ii) study the situation in which the maximum probability of nonlocal events can also be dimension-independent in the second type, and (iii) conjecture how the situation could be changed in order that (ii) still holds.",14,[],6
1404.6644,quant-ph,"In the DP-model, gravity-related spontaneous wave function collapses suppress undesirable Schrodinger Cat states. We derive the equations of the model for the hydrodynamic-elastic (acoustic) modes in a bulk. Two particular features are discussed: the universal dominance of spontaneous collapses at large wavelengths, and the reduction of spontaneous heating by a slight refinement of the DP-model.",14,[],6
1406.5821,quant-ph,"In order to faithfully detect the state of an individual two-state quantum system (qubit) realized using, for example, a trapped ion or atom, state selective scattering of resonance fluorescence is well established. The simplest way to read out this measurement and assign a state is the threshold method. The detection error can be decreased by using more advanced detection methods like the time-resolved method or the equation-pulse detection method. These methods were introduced to qubits with a single possible state change during the measurement process. However, there exist many qubits like the hyperfine qubit of equation where several state change are possible. To decrease the detection error for such qubits, we develope generalizations of the time-resolved method and the equation-pulse detection method for such qubits. We show the advantages of these generalized detection methods in numerical simulations and experiments using the hyperfine qubit of equation. The generalized detection methods developed here can be implemented in an efficient way such that experimental real time state discrimination with improved fidelity is possible.",14,[],6
1408.1612,quant-ph,"The software package \emphQcompiler (CPC, 184 (2013) 853) provides a general quantum compilation framework, which maps any given unitary operation into a quantum circuit consisting of a sequential set of elementary quantum gates. In this paper, we present an extended software \emphOptQC, which finds permutation matrices equation and equation for a given unitary matrix equation such that the number of gates in the quantum circuit of equation is significantly reduced, where equation is equivalent to equation up to a permutation and the quantum circuit implementation of each matrix component is considered separately. We extend further this software package to make use of high-performance computers with a multiprocessor architecture using MPI. We demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing the total number of quantum gates required for various unitary operators.",14,[],6
1410.3281,quant-ph,"We study the dynamics of two kinds of entanglement, and there interplay. On one hand, the intrinsic entanglement within a central system composed by three two level atoms, and measured by multipartite concurrence, on the other, the entanglement between the central system and a cavity, acting as an environment, and measured with purity. Using dipole-dipole and Ising interactions between atoms we propose two Hamiltonians, a homogeneous and a quasi-homogeneous one. We find an upper bound for concurrence as a function of purity, associated to the evolution of the equation state. A lower bound is also observed for the homogeneous case. In both situations, we show the existence of critical values of the interaction, for which the dynamics of entanglement seem complex.",14,[],6
