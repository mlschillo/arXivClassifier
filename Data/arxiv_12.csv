1207.3711,astro-ph,"We study the fluctuations in luminosity distance due to gravitational lensing produced both by galaxy halos and large scale voids. Voids are represented via a ""Swiss cheese"" model consisting of a letterCDM Friedman-Robertson-Walker background in which a number of randomly distributed, spherical regions of comoving radius 35 Mpc are removed. A fraction of the removed mass is then placed on the shells of the spheres, in the form of randomly located halos, modeled with Navarro-Frenk-White profiles. The remaining mass is placed in the interior of the spheres, either smoothly distributed, or as randomly located halos. We compute the distribution of magnitude shifts using a variant of the method of Holz & Wald (1998), which includes the effect of lensing shear. In the two models we consider, the standard deviation of this distribution is 0.065 and 0.072 magnitudes and the mean is -0.0010 and -0.0013 magnitudes, for voids of radius 35 Mpc, sources at redshift 1.5, with the voids chosen so that 90% of the mass is on the shell today. The standard deviation due to voids and halos is a factor ~ 3 larger than that due to 35 Mpc voids alone with a 1 Mpc shell thickness which we studied in our previous work. To a good approximation, the variance of the distribution depends only on the mean column depth and concentration of halos and on the fraction of the mass density that is in the form of halos (as opposed to smoothly distributed): it is independent of how the halos are distributed in space. We derive an approximate analytic formula for the variance that agrees with our numerical results to \lesssim 20% out to z\simeq 1.5.",12,[],1
1201.0546,astro-ph,"The relation between dark matter halos and the loci of star formation at high redshift is a pressing question in contemporary cosmology. Matching the abundance of halos to the abundance of infrared (IR) galaxies, we explicit the link between dark matter halo mass (Mh), stellar mass (M*) and star-formation rate (SFR) up to a redshift of 2. Our findings are five-fold. First, we find a strong evolution of the relation between M* and SFR as a function of redshift with an increase of sSFR = SFR/M* by a factor ~30 between z=0 and z= 2.3. Second, we observe a decrease of sSFR with stellar mass. These results reproduce observed trends at redshift z>0.3. Third, we find that the star formation is most efficient in dark matter halos with Mh~5x1011 Msun, with hints of an increase of this mass with redshift. Fourth, we find that SFR/Mh increases by a factor ~15 between z = 0 and z = 2.3. Finally we find that the SFR density is dominated by halo masses close to ~7x1011 Msun at all redshift, with a rapid decrease at lower and higher halo masses. Despite its simplicity, our novel use of IR observations unveils some characteristic mass-scales governing star formation at high redshift.",12,[],1
1207.7129,astro-ph,"Models of galaxy evolution assume some connection between the AGN and star formation activity in galaxies. We use the multi-wavelength information of the CDFS to assess this issue. We select the AGNs from the 3Ms XMM-Newton survey and measure the star-formation rates of their hosts using data that probe rest-frame wavelengths longward of 20 um. Star-formation rates are obtained from spectral energy distribution fits, identifying and subtracting an AGN component. We divide the star-formation rates by the stellar masses of the hosts to derive specific star-formation rates (sSFR) and find evidence for a positive correlation between the AGN activity (proxied by the X-ray luminosity) and the sSFR for the most active systems with X-ray luminosities exceeding Lx=1043 erg/s and redshifts z~1. We do not find evidence for such a correlation for lower luminosity systems or those at lower redshifts. We do not find any correlation between the SFR (or the sSFR) and the X-ray absorption derived from high-quality XMM-Newton spectra either, showing that the absorption is likely to be linked to the nuclear region rather than the host, while the star-formation is not nuclear. Comparing the sSFR of the hosts to the characteristic sSFR of star-forming galaxies at the same redshift we find that the AGNs reside mostly in main-sequence and starburst hosts, reflecting the AGN - sSFR connection. Limiting our analysis to the highest X-ray luminosity AGNs (X-ray QSOs with Lx>1044 erg/s), we find that the highest-redshift QSOs (with z>2) reside predominantly in starburst hosts, with an average sSFR more than double that of the ""main sequence"", and we find a few cases of QSOs at z~1.5 with specific star-formation rates compatible with the main-sequence, or even in the ""quiescent"" region.

1205.6183,astro-ph,"Lenticular galaxies with MB < -21.5 are almost exclusively unbarred, whereas both barred and unbarred objects occur at fainter luminosity levels. This effect is observed both for objects classified in blue light, and for those that were classified in the infrared. This result suggests that the most luminous (massive) S0 galaxies find it difficult to form bars. As a result the mean luminosity of unbarred lenticular galaxies in both B and IR light is observed to be ~0.4 mag brighter than than that of barred lenticulars. A small contribution to the observed luminosity difference that is found between SA0 and SB0 galaxies may also be due to the fact that there is an asymmetry between the effects of small classification errors on SA0 and SB0 galaxies. An E galaxy might be misclassified as an S0, or an S0 as an E. However, an E will never be misclassified an SB0, nor will an SB0 ever be called an E. This asymmetry is important because elliptical (E) galaxies are typically twice as luminous as lenticular (S0) galaxies. The present results suggest that the evolution of luminous lenticular galaxies may be closely linked to that of elliptical galaxies, whereas fainter lenticulars might be more closely associated with ram-pressure stripped spiral galaxies. Finally it is pointed out that fine details of the galaxy formation process might account for some of the differences between the classifications of the same galaxy by individual competent morphologists.",12,[],1
1208.5890,astro-ph,"From the GOES-12/SXI data, we studied the initial stage of motion for six rapid (over 1500 km/s) ""halo"" coronal mass ejections (HCMEs) and traced the motion of these HCMEs within the SOHO/LASCO C2 and C3 field-of-view. For these HCMEs the time-dependent location, velocity and acceleration of their fronts were revealed. The conclusion was drawn that two types of CME exist depending on their velocity time profile. This profile depends on the properties of the active region where the ejection emerged. CMEs with equal ejection velocity time dependence originate form in the same active region. All the HCMEs studied represent loop-like structures either from the first moment of recording or a few minutes later. All the HCMEs under consideration start their translational motion prior to the associated X-ray flare onset. The main acceleration time (time to reach the highest velocity within the LASCO/C2 field-of-view) is close to the associated flare X-ray radiation intensity rise time. The results of (Zhang and Dere, 2006) on the existence of an inverse correlation between the acceleration amplitude and duration, and also on the equality of the measured HCME main acceleration duration and the associated flare soft X-ray intensity rise time are validated. We established some regularities in the temporal variation of the angular size, trajectory, front width and the HCME longitude-to-cross size ratio.",12,[],1

1207.5577,astro-ph,"The bow shocks of runaway stars with strong stellar winds of over 2000 km sequation can serve as particle acceleration sites. The conversion from stellar wind luminosity into particle acceleration power has an efficiency of the same order of magnitude as those in supernova remnants, based on the radio emission from the bow shock region of runaway star BD43equation3654 \citepBenaglia10.If this object exhibits typical characteristics, then runaway star systems can contribute a non-negligible fraction of Galactic cosmic-ray electrons. To constrain the maximum energy of accelerated particles from measurements of possible non-thermal emissions in the X-ray band, Suzaku observed BD43equation3654 in April 2011 with an exposure of 99 ks. Because the onboard instruments have a stable and low background level, Suzaku detected a possible enhancement over the background of equation cnt arcminequation at the bow shock region, where the error represents the 3 sigma statistics only. However, the excess is not significant within the systematic errors of non-X-ray and cosmic-ray backgrounds of the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer, which are equation and equation cnt arcminequation, respectively, and the 3-sigma upper limit in the X-ray luminosity from the shock region, which is equation erg sequation per 41.2 arcminequation in the 0.5 to 10 keV band. This result leads to three conclusions: (1) a shock-heating process is inefficient on this system; (2) the maximum energy of electrons does not exceed equation 10 TeV, corresponding to a Lorentz factor of less than equation; and (3) the magnetic field in the shock acceleration site might not be as turbulent as those in pulsar wind nebulae and supernova remnants.",12,[],1
1204.1504,astro-ph,"Entropy changes due to delocalization and decoherence effects should modify the predictions for the cosmological neutrino background (CequationB) temperature when one treats neutrino flavors in the framework of composite quantum systems. Assuming that the final stage of neutrino interactions with the equation radiation plasma before decoupling works as a measurement scheme that projects neutrinos into flavor quantum states, the resulting free-streaming neutrinos can be described as a statistical ensemble of flavor-mixed neutrinos. Even not corresponding to an electronic-flavor pure state, after decoupling the statistical ensemble is described by a density matrix that evolves in time with the full Hamiltonian accounting for flavor mixing, momentum delocalization and, in case of an open quantum system approach, decoherence effects. Since the statistical weights, equation, shall follow the electron elastic scattering cross section rapport given by equation, the von-Neumann entropy will deserve some special attention. Depending on the quantum measurement scheme used for quantifying the entropy, mixing associated to dissipative effects can lead to an increasing of the flavor associated von-Neumann entropy for free-streaming neutrinos. The production of von-Neumann entropy mitigates the constraints on the predictions for energy densities and temperatures of a cosmologically evolving isentropic fluid, in this case, the cosmological neutrino background. The effects of entropy changes on the cosmological neutrino temperature are quantified, and the \em constraint involving the number of neutrino species, equation, in the phenomenological confront with Big Bang nucleosynthesis parameters is consistently relieved.",12,"['hep-ph', 'hep-th']",1
1202.3610,astro-ph,"Observations of high-redshift supernovae (SNe) open a novel opportunity to study the massive star population in the early Universe. We study the detectability of superluminous SNe with upcoming optical and near-infrared (NIR) surveys. Our calculations are based on the cosmic star formation history, the SN occurence rate, the characteristic colour and the light curve of the SNe that are all calibrated by available observations. We show that 15-150 SNe up to z ~ 4 will be discovered by the proposed Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam deep survey: 30 deg2 survey with 24.5 AB mag depth in z-band for 3 months. With its ultra-deep layer (3.5 deg2 with 25.6 AB mag depth in z-band for 4 months), the highest redshift can be extended to z ~ 5. We further explore the detectability by upcoming NIR survey utilizing future satellites such as Euclid, WFIRST, and WISH. The wide-field NIR surveys are very efficient to detect high-redshift SNe. With a hypothetical deep NIR survey for 100 deg2 with 26 AB mag depth at 1-4 um, at least ~ 50 SNe will be discovered at z>3 in half a year. The number of the detected SNe can place a strong constraint on the stellar initial mass function or its slope especially at the high-mass end. Superluminous SNe at high redshifts can be distinguished from other types of SNe by the long time-scale of their light curves in the observer's frame, the optical colours redder than other core-collapse SNe and the NIR colours redder than any other types of SNe.",12,[],1
1203.5786,astro-ph,"We have started a campaign to identify massive star clusters inside bright molecular bubbles towards the Galactic Center. The CN15/16/17 molecular complex is the first example of our study. The region is characterized by the presence of two young clusters, DB10 and DB11, visible in the NIR, an ultra-compact HII region identified in the radio, several young stellar objects visible in the MIR, a bright diffuse nebulosity at 8letter m coming from PAHs and sub-mm continuum emission revealing the presence of cold dust. Given its position on the sky (l=0.58, b=-0.85) and its kinematic distance of ~7.5 kpc, the region was thought to be a very massive site of star formation in proximity of the CMZ. The cluster DB11 was estimated to be as massive as 104 Msun. However the region's properties were known only through photometry and its kinematic distance was very uncertain given its location at the tangential point. We aimed at better characterizing the region and assess whether it could be a site of massive star formation located close to the Galactic Center. We have obtained NTT/SofI JHKs photometry and long slit K band spectroscopy of the brightest members. We have additionally collected data in the radio, sub-mm and mid infrared, resulting in a quite different picture of the region. We have confirmed the presence of massive early B type stars and have derived a spectro-photometric distance of ~1.2 kpc, much smaller than the kinematic distance. Adopting this distance we obtain clusters masses of M(DB10) ~ 170 Msun and M(DB11) ~ 275 Msun. This is consistent with the absence of any O star, confirmed by the excitation/ionization status of the nebula. No HeI diffuse emission is detected in our spectroscopic observations at 2.113letter m, which would be expected if the region was hosting more massive stars. Radio continuum measurements are also consistent with the region hosting at most early B stars.",12,[],1
1207.1162,astro-ph,"Stars form with gaseous and dusty circumstellar envelopes, which rapidly settle into disks that eventually give rise to planetary systems. Understanding the process by which these disks evolve is paramount in developing an accurate theory of planet formation that can account for the variety of planetary systems discovered so far. The formation of Earth-like planets through collisional accumulation of rocky objects within a disk has mainly been explored in theoretical and computational work in which post-collision ejecta evolution is typically ignored, although recent work has considered the fate of such material. Here we report observations of a young, Sun-like star (TYC 8241 2652 1) where infrared flux from post-collisional ejecta has decreased drastically, by a factor of about 30, over a period of less than two years. The star seems to have gone from hosting substantial quantities of dusty ejecta, in a region analogous to where the rocky planets orbit in the Solar System, to retaining at most a meagre amount of cooler dust. Such a phase of rapid ejecta evolution has not been previously predicted or observed, and no currently available physical model satisfactorily explains the observations.",12,[],1
1212.2289,astro-ph,"By reaching through shrouding blastwaves, efficiently discovering off-axis events, and probing the central engine at work, gravitational wave (GW) observations will soon revolutionize the study of gamma-ray bursts. Already, analyses of GW data targeting gamma-ray bursts have helped constrain the central engines of selected events. Advanced GW detectors with significantly improved sensitivities are under construction. After outlining the GW emission mechanisms from gamma-ray burst progenitors (binary coalescences, stellar core collapses, magnetars, and others) that may be detectable with advanced detectors, we review how GWs will improve our understanding of gamma-ray burst central engines, their astrophysical formation channels, and the prospects and methods for different search strategies. We place special emphasis on multimessenger searches. To achieve the most scientific benefit, GW, electromagnetic, and neutrino observations should be combined to provide greater discriminating power and science reach.",12,['gr-qc'],1
1211.1383,astro-ph,"A positive power-law trend between the local surface densities of molecular gas, equation, and young stellar objects, equation, in molecular clouds of the Solar Neighbourhood has been identified by Gutermuth et al. How it relates to the properties of embedded clusters, in particular to the recently established radius-density relation, has so far not been investigated. In this paper, we model the development of the stellar component of molecular clumps as a function of time and initial local volume density so as to provide a coherent framework able to explain both the molecular-cloud and embedded-cluster relations quoted above. To do so, we associate the observed volume density gradient of molecular clumps to a density-dependent free-fall time. The molecular clump star formation history is obtained by applying a constant SFE per free-fall time, equation.   For volume density profiles typical of observed molecular clumps (i.e. power-law slope equation), our model gives a star-gas surface-density relation equation, in very good agreement with the Gutermuth et al relation. Taking the case of a molecular clump of mass equation and radius equation experiencing star formation during 2 Myr, we derive what SFE per free-fall time matches best the normalizations of the observed and predicted (equation, equation) relations. We find equation. We show that the observed growth of embedded clusters, embodied by their radius-density relation, corresponds to a surface density threshold being applied to developing star-forming regions. The consequences of our model in terms of cluster survivability after residual star-forming gas expulsion are that due to the locally high SFE in the inner part of star-forming regions, global SFE as low as 10% can lead to the formation of bound gas-free star clusters.",12,[],1
1210.1617,astro-ph,"In certain mass ranges, massive stars can undergo a violent pulsation triggered by the electron/positron pair instability that ejects matter, but does not totally disrupt the star. After one or more of these pulsations, such stars are expected to undergo core-collapse to trigger a supernova explosion. The mass range susceptible to this pulsational phenomena may be as low as 50-70 Msun if the progenitor is of very low metallicity and rotating sufficiently rapidly to undergo nearly homogeneous evolution. The mass, dynamics, and composition of the matter ejected in the pulsation are important aspects to determine the subsequent observational characteristics of the explosion. We examine the dynamics of a sample of stellar models and rotation rates and discuss the implications for the first stars, for LBV-like phenomena, and for superluminous supernovae. We find that the shells ejected by pulsational pair-instability events with rapidly rotating progenitors (>30% the critical value) are hydrogen-poor and helium and oxygen-rich.",12,[],1
1211.4615,astro-ph,"We explore the connection between the local escape velocity, Vesc, and the stellar population properties in the ATLAS3D survey, a complete, volume-limited sample of nearby early-type galaxies. We make use of ugriz photometry to construct Multi-Gaussian Expansion models of the surface brightnesses of our galaxies. We are able to fit the full range of surface brightness profiles found in our sample, and in addition we reproduce the results of state-of-the-art photometry in the literature with residuals of 0.04 mags. We utilise these photometric models and SAURON integral-field spectroscopy, combined with Jeans dynamical modelling, to determine the local Vesc derived from the surface brightness. We find that the local Vesc is tightly correlated with the Mgb and Fe5015 linestrengths and optical colours, and anti-correlated with the Hbeta linestrength. In the case of the Mgb and Colour - Vesc relations we find that the relation within individual galaxies follows the global relation between different galaxies. We intentionally ignored any uncertain contribution due to dark matter since we are seeking an empirical description of stellar population gradients in early-type galaxies that is ideal for quantitative comparison with model predictions. We identify a population of galaxies that occur only at low Vesc that exhibit negative gradients in the Mgb - and Colour -Vesc relations. These galaxies typically have young central stellar populations and contain significant amounts of molecular gas and dust. Combining these results with N-body simulations of binary mergers we use the Mgb-Vesc relation to constrain the possible number of dry mergers experienced by the local early-type galaxy population - a typical massive ETG can have experienced only ~1.5 major mergers before becoming a significant outlier in the Mgb-Vesc relation.

1208.2231,astro-ph,"Test particles infalling from infinity onto a compact spherical star with a mildly super-Eddington luminosity at its surface are typically trapped on the ""Eddington Capture Sphere"" and do not reach the surface of the star. The presence of a sphere on which radiation pressure balances gravity for static particles was first discovered some twenty five years ago. Subsequently, it was shown to be a capture sphere for particles in radial motion, and more recently also for particles in non-radial motion, in which the Poynting-Robertson radiation drag efficiently removes the orbital angular momentum of the particles, reducing it to zero. Here we develop this idea further, showing that ""levitation"" on the Eddington sphere (above the stellar surface) is a state of stable equilibrium, and discuss its implications for Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion onto a luminous star. When the Eddington sphere is present, the cross-section of a compact star for actual accretion is typically less than the geometrical cross-section (pi Rsquared), direct infall onto the stellar surface only being possible for relativistic particles, with the required minimum particle velocity at infinity typically ~1/2 the speed of light. We further show that particles on typical trajectories in the vicinity of the stellar surface will also be trapped on the Eddington Capture Sphere.",12,['gr-qc'],1
1211.1307,astro-ph,"Spectroscopic observations at the Russian 6-m telescope are used to study the two polar ring galaxies (PRGs) from the catalogue by Moiseev et al.: SPRC-7 and SPRC-260. We have analyzed the kinematics of the stellar component of the central galaxies as well as the ionized gas kinematics in the external ring structures. The disc-halo decomposition of rotation curves in two perpendicular directions are considered. The observed 2D velocity fields are compared with the model predictions for different dark halo shapes. Based on these data, we constrain that for potential of DM halo semiaxis ratios is equation, equation for SPRC-7 and equation, equation for SPRC-260. Using 3D hydrodynamic simulations we also study the dynamics and evolution of the polar component in the potential of the galactic disc and dark halo for these two galaxies. We show that the polar component is dynamically quasi-stable on the scale of equation dynamical times (about a few Gyr). This is demonstrate the possibility for the growth of a spiral structure, which then steadily transforms to a lopsided gaseous system in the polar pane.",12,[],1
1204.0627,astro-ph,"The Carina Nebula represents one of the most massive galactic star forming regions and displays a high level of massive star feedback. We used SPIRE and PACS onboard of Herschel to map the full spatial extent of the clouds in the Carina Nebula complex at wavelengths between 70 and 500 micrometer. We determine color temperatures and column densities of the clouds in the complex. Our Herschel maps show that the clouds have a very complex and filamentary structure that is dominated by the radiation and wind feedback from the massive stars. In most locations, the column density of the clouds is NH < 2x1022 cm-2; denser cloud structures are restricted to just a few locations. We find a clear large scale temperature gradient from 35-40 K in the central region to <20 K at the periphery and in the densest parts of individual pillars. The total mass of the clouds seen by Herschel in the central (1 deg radius) region is ~656000 Msun. A simple radiative transfer model for the global spectral energy distribution suggests that the total mass of all the gas (including a warmer component that is not well traced by Herschel) is <=890000 Msun. Despite the strong feedback from numerous massive stars that is going on since several million years, there are still several 10000 Msun of cool cloud material present at column-densities sufficient for further star formation. Comparison of our total gas mass estimates to molecular cloud masses derived from CO line mapping suggests that as much as about 75% of all the gas is in atomic rather than molecular form.",12,[],1
1201.2434,astro-ph,"The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated by some form of ""dark energy"" with exotic physical properties, or that Einstein's theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious experimental efforts to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and galaxy clusters. We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit ""Stage IV"" dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space distortions, the Alcock-Paczynski test, and direct measurements of H0. We present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of state and parameterized deviations from GR, achievable with Stage III and Stage IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and CMB data. We also show the level of precision required for other methods to provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic acceleration produce data sets with broad applications, and they continue the longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater detail over ever larger scales.",12,[],1
1207.0008,astro-ph,"We present optical spectroscopic measurements of the eclipsing High Mass X-ray Binary XMMU J013236.7303228 in M33. Based on spectra taken at multiple epochs of the 1.73d binary orbital period we determine physical as well as orbital parameters for the donor star. We find the donor to be a B1.5IV sub-giant with effective temperature T=22,000-23,000 K. From the luminosity, temperature and known distance to M33 we derive a radius of R = 8.9  0.5 Rsun. From the radial--velocity measurements, we determine a velocity semi-amplitude of Kopt = 63  12 km/sec. Using the physical properties of the B-star determined from the optical spectrum, we estimate the star's mass to be Mopt = 11  1 Msun. Based on the X-ray spectrum, the compact companion is likely a neutron star, although no pulsations have yet been detected. Using the spectroscopically derived B-star mass we find the neutron star companion mass to be MX = 2.0  0.4 Msun, consistent with the neutron star mass in the HMXB Vela X-1, but heavier than the canonical value of 1.4 Msun found for many millisecond pulsars. We attempt to use as an additional constraint that the B star radius inferred from temperature, flux, and distance, should equate the Roche radius, since the system accretes by Roche lobe overflow. This leads to substantially larger masses, but from trying to apply the technique to known systems, we find that the masses are consistently overestimated. Attempting to account for that in our uncertainties, we derive MX = 2.20.8-0.6 Msun and Mopt =13  4 Msun. We conclude that precise constraints require detailed modeling of the shape of the Roche surface.",12,[],1
1202.0402,astro-ph,"While the selection of strongly lensed galaxies with 500letterm flux density S500>100 mJy has proven to be rather straightforward (Negrello et al. 2010), for many applications it is important to analyze samples larger than the ones obtained when confining ourselves to such a bright limit. Moreover, only by probing to fainter flux densities is possible to exploit strong lensing to investigate the bulk of the high-z star-forming galaxy population. We describe HALOS (the Herschel-ATLAS Lensed Objects Selection), a method for efficiently selecting fainter candidate strongly lensed galaxies, reaching a surface density of ~1.5-2 deg-2, i.e. a factor of about 4 to 6 higher than that at the 100 mJy flux limit. HALOS will allow the selection of up to ~1000 candidate strongly lensed galaxies (with amplifications letter>2) over the full H-ATLAS survey area. Applying HALOS to the H-ATLAS Science Demonstration Phase field (~14.4 deg2) we find 31 candidate strongly lensed galaxies, whose candidate lenses are identified in the VIKING near-infrared catalog. Using the available information on candidate sources and candidate lenses we tentatively estimate a ~72% purity of the sample. The redshift distribution of the candidate lensed sources is close to that reported for most previous surveys for lensed galaxies, while that of candidate lenses extends to substantially higher redshifts than found in the other surveys. The counts of candidate strongly lensed galaxies are also in good agreement with model predictions (Lapi et al. 2011). Even though a key ingredient of the method is the deep near-infrared VIKING photometry, we show that H-ATLAS data alone allow the selection of a similarly deep sample of candidate strongly lensed galaxies with an efficiency close to 50%; a slightly lower surface density (~1.45 deg-2) can be reached with a ~70% efficiency.",12,[],1
1202.1784,astro-ph,"We use high-resolution images of the sun obtained by the SDO/AIA instrument to study the evolution of the coronal loops in a flaring solar active region. During 15 February 2011 a X-2.2 class flare occurred in NOAA 11158, a equation sunspot complex. We identify three distinct phases of the coronal loop dynamics during this event: (i) \it Slow rise phase: slow rising motion of the loop-tops prior to the flare in response to slow rise of the underlying flux rope, (ii) \it Collapse phase: sudden contraction of the loop-tops with lower loops collapsing earlier than the higher loops, and (iii) \it Oscillation phase: the loops exhibit global kink oscillations after the collapse phase at different periods, with period decreasing with decreasing height of the loops. The period of these loop oscillations is used to estimate the field strength in the coronal loops of different loop lengths in this active region. Further, we also use SDO/HMI observations to study the photospheric changes close to the polarity inversion line (PIL). The longitudinal magnetograms show step-wise permanent decrease in the magnetic flux after the flare over a coherent patch along the PIL. Further, we examine the HMI Stokes I,Q,U,V profiles over this patch and find that the Stokes-V signal systematically decreases while the Stokes-Q and U signal increases after the flare. These observations suggest that close to the PIL the field configuration became more horizontal after the flare. We also use HMI vector magnetic field observations to quantify the changes in the field inclination angle and found an inward collapse of the field lines towards the polarity inversion line (PIL) by equation 10equation. These observations are consistent with the ""coronal implosion"" scenario and its predictions about flare related photospheric field changes.",12,[],1
1212.6365,astro-ph,"We present 3D implicit large eddy simulations (ILES) of the turbulent convection in the envelope of a 5 Msun red giant star and in the oxygen-burning shell of a 23 Msun supernova progenitor. The numerical models are analyzed in the framework of 1D Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. The effects of pressure fluctuations are more important in the red giant model, owing to larger stratification of the convective zone. We show how this impacts different terms in the mean-field equations. We clarify the driving sources of kinetic energy, and show that the rate of turbulent dissipation is comparable to the convective luminosity. Although our flows have low Mach number and are nearly adiabatic, our analysis is general and can be applied to photospheric convection as well. The robustness of our analysis of turbulent convection is supported by the insensitivity of the mean-field balances to linear mesh resolution. We find robust results for the turbulent convection zone and the stable layers in the oxygen-burning shell model, and robust results everywhere in the red giant model, but the mean fields are not well converged in the narrow boundary regions (which contain steep gradients) in the oxygen-burning shell model. This last result illustrates the importance of unresolved physics at the convective boundary, which governs the mixing there.",12,['physics'],1
1206.3060,astro-ph,"The discovery of two active black holes in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 3393, separated by about 490 light years, revealed a merging event. This led us to look for other evidences of galaxy collision and merging through the analysis of the observed spectra in different frequency ranges. We found preshock densities higher by a factor of about 10 in the NGC 3393 NLR than in other AGN and patches of ionized matter beyond the observed NLR bulk. They can be explained by compression and heating of the gas downstream of shock waves created by collision. Metallicity in terms of the O/H relative abundance, is about 0.78 solar. Mg/H depletion by a factor of about 3 compared with solar cannot be explained by Mg trapping into dust grains, due to rather high shock velocities. The low O/H and Mg/H abundances indicate mixing with external matter during collision. Twice solar N/H is predicted by modelling the spectra of high shock velocity clouds reached by a Ts =8.6 104 K black-body flux. This suggests that Wolf-Rayet stars could be created by galaxy collision in the central region.",12,[],1

During such non-stationary accretion events, the shape of the accreting object evolves in time, and observable quasi-periodic phenomena with variable quasi-periods are produced.

1201.5742,astro-ph,"We explore in this paper the ability to constrain the Galactic magnetic field intensity and spatial distribution with the incoming data from the Planck satellite experiment. We perform realistic simulations of the Planck observations at the polarized frequency bands from 30 to 353 GHz for two all-sky surveys as expected for the nominal mission. These simulations include CMB, synchrotron and thermal dust Galactic emissions and instrumental noise. (Note that systematic effects are not considered in this paper). For the synchrotron and thermal dust Galactic emissions we use a coherent 3D model of the Galaxy describing its mater density and the magnetic field direction and intensity. We first simulate the synchrotron and dust emissions at 408 MHz and 545 GHz, respectively, and then we extrapolate them to the Planck frequency bands. We perform a likelihood analysis to compare the simulated data to a set of models obtained by varying the pitch angle of the regular magnetic field spatial distribution, the relative amplitude of the turbulent magnetic field, the radial scale of the electron and dust grain distributions, and the extrapolation spectral indices for the synchrotron and thermal dust emissions. We are able to set tight constraints on all the parameters considered. We have also found that the observed spatial variations of the synchrotron and thermal dust spectral indices should not affect our ability to recover the other parameters of the model. From this, we conclude that the Planck satellite experiment can precisely measure the main properties of the Galactic magnetic field. An accurate reconstruction of the matter distribution would require on the one hand an improved modelling of the ISM and on the other hand to use extra data sets like rotation measurements of pulsars.",12,[],1
1211.6954,astro-ph,"We present global structural parameter measurements of 109,533 unique, HF160W-selected objects from the CANDELS multi-cycle treasury program. Sersic model fits for these objects are produced with GALFIT in all available near-infrared filters (HF160W, JF125W and, for a subset, YF105W). The parameters of the best-fitting Sersic models (total magnitude, half-light radius, Sersic index, axis ratio, and position angle) are made public, along with newly constructed point spread functions for each field and filter. Random uncertainties in the measured parameters are estimated for each individual object based on a comparison between multiple, independent measurements of the same set of objects. To quantify systematic uncertainties we create a mosaic with simulated galaxy images with a realistic distribution of input parameters and then process and analyze the mosaic in an identical manner as the real data. We find that accurate and precise measurements -- to 10% or better -- of all structural parameters can typically be obtained for galaxies with HF160W < 23, with comparable fidelity for basic size and shape measurements for galaxies to HF160W ~ 24.5.",12,[],1
1205.2147,astro-ph,"PSR B1259-63/LS 2883 is a binary system in which a 48-ms pulsar orbits around a Be star in a high eccentric orbit with a long orbital period of about 3.4 yr. It is special for having asymmetric two-peak profiles in both the X-ray and the TeV light curves. Recently, an unexpected GeV flare was detected by equation gamma-ray observatory several weeks after the last periastron passage. In this paper, we show that this observed GeV flare could be produced by the Doppler-boosted synchrotron emission in the bow shock tail. An anisotropic pulsar wind model, which mainly affects the energy flux injection to the termination shock in different orbital phase, is also used in this paper, and we find that the anisotropy in the pulsar wind can play a significant role in producing the asymmetric two-peak profiles in both X-ray and TeV light curves. The X-ray and TeV photons before periastron are mainly produced by the shocked electrons around the shock apex and the light curves after periastron are contributed by the emission from the shock apex and the shock tail together, which result in the asymmetric two-peak light curves.",12,[],1

We aim to re-examine the radio spectral index and its spatial variation over the Monoceros SNR, and study its properties of evolution within the complex interstellar medium. We extracted radio continuum data for the Monoceros complex region from the Effelsberg 21 cm and 11 cm surveys and the Urumqi 6 cm polarization survey. We used the new Arecibo GALFA-HI survey data with much higher resolution and sensitivity than that previously available to identify the HI shell related with the SNR. Multi-wavelengths data are included to investigate the properties of the SNR. The spectral index equation (equation) averaged over the SNR is equation0.16. The TT-plots and the distribution of equation over the SNR show spatial variations which steepen towards the inner western filamentary shell. Polarized emission is prominent on the western filamentary shell region. The RM there is estimated to be about 30equation77n rad mequation, where the n=1 solution is preferred, and the magnetic field has a strength of about 9.5 equationG. From the HI channel maps, further evidence is provided for an interaction between the Monoceros SNR and the Rosette Nebula. We identify partial neutral hydrogen shell structures in the northwestern region at LSR velocities of 15 km sequation circumscribing the continuum emission. The HI shell has swept up a mass of about 4000 Mequation for a distance of 1.6 kpc. The western HI shell, well associated with the dust mission, is found to lie outside of the radio shell.

1208.2276,astro-ph,"Planets and other low-mass binary companions to stars face a variety of potential fates as their host stars move off the main sequence and grow to subgiants and giants. Stellar mass loss tends to make orbits expand, and tidal torques tend to make orbits shrink, sometimes to the point that a companion is directly engulfed by its primary. Furthermore, once engulfed, the ensuing common envelope (CE) phase can result in the companion becoming fully incorporated in the primary's envelope; or, if the companion is massive enough, it can transfer enough energy to eject the envelope and remain parked in a tight orbit around the white dwarf core. Therefore, ordinary binary evolution ought to lead to two predominant populations of planets around white dwarfs: those that have been through a CE phase and are in short-period orbits, and those that have entirely avoided the CE and are in long-period orbits.",12,[],1
1210.6563,astro-ph,"Exponential, de Vaucouleurs, and S\'ersic profiles are simple and successful models for fitting two-dimensional images of galaxies. One numerical issue encountered in this kind of fitting is the pixel rendering and convolution (or correlation) of the models with the telescope point-spread function (PSF); these operations are slow, and easy to get slightly wrong at small radii. Here we exploit the realization that these models can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy with a mixture (linear superposition) of two-dimensional Gaussians (MoGs). MoGs are fast to render and fast to affine-transform. Most importantly, if you have a MoG model for the pixel-convolved PSF, the PSF-convolved, affine-transformed galaxy models are themselves MoGs and therefore very fast to compute, integrate, and render precisely. We present worked examples that can be directly used in image fitting; we are using them ourselves. The MoG profiles we provide can be swapped in to replace the standard models in any image-fitting code; they sped up model fitting in our projects by an order of magnitude; they ought to make any code faster at essentially no cost in precision.",12,[],1
1209.4359,astro-ph,"The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is producing the most detailed inventory of the gamma-ray sky to date. Despite tremendous achievements approximately 25% of all Fermi extragalactic sources in the Second Fermi LAT Catalogue (2FGL) are listed as active galactic nuclei (AGN) of uncertain type. Typically, these are suspected blazar candidates without a conclusive optical spectrum or lacking spectroscopic observations. Here, we explore the use of machine-learning algorithms - Random Forests and Support Vector Machines - to predict specific AGN subclass based on observed gamma-ray spectral properties. After training and testing on identified/associated AGN from the 2FGL we find that 235 out of 269 AGN of uncertain type have properties compatible with gamma-ray BL Lacs and flat-spectrum radio quasars with accuracy rates of 85%. Additionally, direct comparison of our results with class predictions made after following the infrared colour-colour space of Massaro et al.

1206.6968,astro-ph,"We present deep photometry in the B,V and I filters from CTIO/MOSAIC for about 270.000 stars in the Fornax dwarf Spheroidal galaxy, out to a radius of rell\sim0.8 degrees. By combining the accurately calibrated photometry with the spectroscopic metallicity distributions of individual Red Giant Branch stars we obtain the detailed star formation and chemical evolution history of Fornax. Fornax is dominated by intermediate age (1-10 Gyr) stellar populations, but also includes ancient (10-14 Gyr), and young (<1 Gyr) stars. We show that Fornax displays a radial age gradient, with younger, more metal-rich populations dominating the central region. This confirms results from previous works. Within an elliptical radius of 0.8 degrees, or 1.9 kpc from the centre, a total mass in stars of 4.3x107 Msun was formed, from the earliest times until 250 Myr ago. Using the detailed star formation history, age estimates are determined for individual stars on the upper RGB, for which spectroscopic abundances are available, giving an age-metallicity relation of the Fornax dSph from individual stars. This shows that the average metallicity of Fornax went up rapidly from [Fe/H]<-2.5 dex to [Fe/H]=-1.5 dex between 8-12 Gyr ago, after which a more gradual enrichment resulted in a narrow, well-defined sequence which reaches [Fe/H]\sim-0.8 dex, \sim3 Gyr ago. These ages also allow us to measure the build-up of chemical elements as a function of time, and thus determine detailed timescales for the evolution of individual chemical elements. A rapid decrease in [Mg/Fe] is seen for the stars with [Fe/H]>-1.5 dex, with a clear trend in age.",12,[],1

1205.2732,astro-ph,"Using star formation histories derived from optically resolved stellar populations in nineteen nearby starburst dwarf galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope, we measure the stellar mass surface densities of stars newly formed in the bursts. By assuming a star formation efficiency (SFE), we then calculate the inferred gas surface densities present at the onset of the starbursts. Assuming a SFE of 1%, as is often assumed in normal star-forming galaxies, and assuming that the gas was purely atomic, translates to very high HI surface densities (~102-103 Msun pc-2), which are much higher than have been observed in dwarf galaxies. This implies either higher values of SFE in these dwarf starburst galaxies or the presence of significant amounts of H2 in dwarfs (or both). Raising the assumed SFEs to 10% or greater (in line with observations of more massive starbursts associated with merging galaxies), still results in HI surface densities higher than observed in 10 galaxies. Thus, these observations appear to require that a significant fraction of the gas in these dwarf starbursts galaxies was in the molecular form at the onset of the bursts. Our results imply molecular gas column densities in the range 1019-1021 cm-2 for the sample. In those galaxies where CO observations have been made, these densities correspond to values of the CO-H2 conversion factor (XCO) in the range >3-80x1020 cm-2 (K km s-1)-1, or up to 40x greater than Galactic XCO values.",12,[],1
1205.0656,astro-ph,"In this paper we discuss a multi-field model of inflation in which generally all fields are non-minimally coupled to the Ricci scalar and have non-canonical kinetic terms. The background evolution and first-order perturbations for the model are evaluated in both the Jordan and Einstein frames, and the respective curvature perturbations compared. We confirm that they are indeed not the same - unlike in the single-field case - and also that the difference is a direct consequence of the isocurvature perturbations inherent to multi-field models. This result leads us to conclude that the notion of adiabaticity is not invariant under conformal transformations. Using a two-field example we show that even if in one frame the evolution is adiabatic, meaning that the curvature perturbation is conserved on super-horizon scales, in general in the other frame isocurvature perturbations continue to source the curvature perturbation. We also find that it is possible to realise a particular model in which curvature perturbations in both frames are conserved but with each being of different magnitude. These examples highlight that the curvature perturbation itself, despite being gauge-invariant, does not correspond directly to an observable. The non-equivalence of the two curvature perturbations would also be important when considering the addition of Standard Model matter into the system.",12,['gr-qc'],1
1205.2457,astro-ph,"We have used 605 days of photometric data from the Kepler spacecraft to study KIC 6614501, a close binary system with an orbital period of 0.15749747(25) days (3.779939 hours), that consists of a low-mass subdwarf B (sdB) star and a white dwarf. As seen in many other similar systems, the gravitational field of the white dwarf produces an ellipsoidal deformation of the sdB which appears in the light curve as a modulation at two times the orbital frequency. The ellipsoidal deformation of the sdB implies that the system has a maximum inclination of ~40 degrees, with i \approx 20 degrees being the most likely. The orbital radial velocity of the sdB star is high enough to produce a Doppler beaming effect with an amplitude of 432  5 ppm, clearly visible in the folded light curve. The photometric amplitude that we obtain, K1 = 85.8 km/s, is ~12 per cent less than the spectroscopic RV amplitude of 97.2  2.0 km/s. The discrepancy is due to the photometric contamination from a close object at about 5 arcsec North West of KIC 6614501, which is difficult to remove. The atmospheric parameters of the sdB star, Teff = 23 700  500 K and log g = 5.70  0.10, imply that it is a rare object below the Extreme Horizontal Branch (EHB), similar to HD 188112 (Heber et al. 2003). The comparison with different evolutionary tracks suggests a mass between ~0.18 and ~0.25 Msun, too low to sustain core helium burning. If the mass was close to 0.18-0.19 Msun, the star could be already on the final He-core WD cooling track. A higher mass, up to ~0.25 Msun, would be compatible with a He-core WD progenitor undergoing a cooling phase in a H-shell flash loop. A third possibility, with a mass between ~0.32 and ~0.40 Msun, can not be excluded and would imply that the sdB is a ""normal"" (but with an unusually low mass) EHB star burning He...",12,[],1
1204.3787,astro-ph,"Filament longitudinal oscillations have been observed on the solar disk in Hequation. We intend to find an example of the longitudinal oscillations of a prominence, where the magnetic dip can be seen directly, and examine what is the restoring force of such kind of oscillations. We carry out a multiwavelength data analysis of the active region prominence oscillations above the western limb on 2007 February 8. Besides, we perform a one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of the longitudinal oscillations. The high-resolution observations by Hinode/SOT indicate that the prominence, seen as a concave-inward shape in lower-resolution Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) images, actually consists of many concave-outward threads, which is indicative of the existence of magnetic dips. After being injected into the dip region, a bulk of prominence material started to oscillate for more than 3.5 hours, with the period being 52 min. The oscillation decayed with time, with the decay timescale being 133 min. Our hydrodynamic simulation can well reproduce the oscillation period, but the damping timescale in the simulation is 1.5 times as long as the observations. The results clearly show the prominence longitudinal oscillations around the dip of the prominence and our study suggests that the restoring force of the longitudinal oscillations might be the gravity. Radiation and heat conduction are insufficient to explain the decay of the oscillations. Other mechanisms, such as wave leakage and mass accretion, have to be considered. The possible relation between the longitudinal oscillations and the later eruption of a prominence thread, as well as a coronal mass ejection (CME), is also discussed.",12,[],1
1210.3689,astro-ph,"We present a study of multiwavelength X-ray and weak lensing scaling relations for a sample of 50 clusters of galaxies. Our analysis combines Chandra and XMM-Newton data using an energy-dependent cross-calibration. After considering a number of scaling relations, we find that gas mass is the most robust estimator of weak lensing mass, yielding 15 /- 6% intrinsic scatter at r500 (the pseudo-pressure YX has a consistent scatter of 22%/-5%). The scatter does not change when measured within a fixed physical radius of 1 Mpc. Clusters with small BCG to X-ray peak offsets constitute a very regular population whose members have the same gas mass fractions and whose even smaller <10% deviations from regularity can be ascribed to line of sight geometrical effects alone. Cool-core clusters, while a somewhat different population, also show the same (<10%) scatter in the gas mass-lensing mass relation. There is a good correlation and a hint of bimodality in the plane defined by BCG offset and central entropy (or central cooling time). The pseudo-pressure YX does not discriminate between the more relaxed and less relaxed populations, making it perhaps the more even-handed mass proxy for surveys. Overall, hydrostatic masses underestimate weak lensing masses by 10% on the average at r500; but cool-core clusters are consistent with no bias, while non-cool-core clusters have a large and constant 15-20% bias between r2500 and r500, in agreement with N-body simulations incorporating unthermalized gas. For non-cool-core clusters, the bias correlates well with BCG ellipticity. We also examine centroid shift variance and and power ratios to quantify substructure; these quantities do not correlate with residuals in the scaling relations. Individual clusters have for the most part forgotten the source of their departures from self-similarity.",12,[],1
1210.7644,astro-ph,"It is proposed that the observed near-surface inflows towards the active regions and sunspot zones provide a nonlinear feedback mechanism that limits the amplitude of a Babcock-Leighton-type solar dynamo and determines the variation of the cycle strength. This hypothesis is tested with surface flux transport simulations including converging latitudinal flows that depend on the surface distribution of magnetic flux. The inflows modulate the build-up of polar fields (represented by the axial dipole) by reducing the tilt angles of bipolar magnetic regions and by affecting the cross-equator transport of leading-polarity magnetic flux. With flux input derived from the observed record of sunspot groups, the simulations cover the period between 1874 and 1980 (corresponding to solar cycles 11 to 20). The inclusion of the inflows leads to a strong correlation of the simulated axial dipole strength during activity minimum with the observed amplitude of the subsequent cycle. This in agreement with empirical correlations and in line with what is expected from a Babcock-Leighton-type dynamo. The results provide evidence that the latitudinal inflows are a key ingredient in determining the amplitude of solar cycles.",12,[],1
1206.5527,astro-ph,"Context: The majority of studies on stressed 3D magnetic null points consider magnetic reconnection driven by an external perturbation, but the formation of a genuine current sheet equilibrium remains poorly understood. This problem has been considered more extensively in two-dimensions, but lacks a generalization into 3D fields.   Aims: 3D magnetic nulls are more complex than 2D nulls and the field can take a greater range of magnetic geometries local to the null. Here, we focus on one type and consider the dynamical non-resistive relaxation of 3D spiral nulls with initial spine-aligned current. We aim to provide a valid magnetohydrostatic equilibrium, and describe the electric current accumulations in various cases, involving a finite plasma pressure.   Methods: A full MHD code is used, with the resistivity set to zero so that reconnection is not allowed, to run a series of experiments in which a perturbed spiral 3D null point is allowed to relax towards an equilibrium, via real, viscous damping forces. Changes to the initial plasma pressure and other magnetic parameters are investigated systematically.   Results: For the axi-symmetric case, the evolution of the field and the plasma is such that it concentrates the current density in two cone-shaped regions along the spine, thus concentrating the twist of the magnetic field around the spine, leaving a radial configuration in the fan plane. The plasma pressure redistributes in order to maintain the current density accumulations. However, it is found that changes in the initial plasma pressure do not modify the final state significantly. In the cases where the initial magnetic field is not axi-symmetric, a infinite-time singularity of current perpendicular to the fan is found at the location of the null.",12,[],1

Using a local Taylor expansion method we study the low-redshift conditions to obtain an apparent negative deceleration parameter equation derived from the luminosity distance equation for a central observer in a LTB space, confirming that central smoothness implies a positive central deceleration. Since observational data is only available at redshift greater than zero we find the critical values of the parameters defining a centrally smooth LTB model which give a positive apparent acceleration at equation, providing a graphical representation of the conditions in the equation plane, which are respectively the zero and first order terms of the central Taylor expansion of equation. We finally derive a coordinate independent expression for the apparent deceleration parameter based on the expansion of the relevant functions in red-shift rather than in the radial coordinate.   We calculate equation with two different methods to solve the null geodesic equations, one based on a local central expansion of the solution in terms of cosmic time and the other one using the exact analytical solution in terms of generalized conformal time. %The expansion of the solution in terms of cosmic time is quite useful also for other applications requiring foliation %of space-time in space-like hyper-surfaces, such as spatial averaging, which is much more difficult to study using the %analytical solution in terms of the generalized conformal time coordinate.",12,"['gr-qc', 'hep-th']",1

Four potential candidates with F30=(1-1.5)x1010 cm-2 and no events with F30>2x1010 cm-2 are identified since 1400 AD in the annually resolved 10Be data. A strong SPE related to the Carrington flare of 1859 AD is not supported by the data.

This values serve as an observational upper limit for the strength of SPE on the time scale of tens of millennia. Two events, ca. 780 and 1460 AD, appear in different data series making them strong candidates to extreme SPEs. We built a distribution of the occurrence probability of extreme SPEs, providing a new strict observational constraint. Practical limits can be set as F30~1x, 2-3x, and 5x1010 cm-2 for the occurrence probability ~10-2, 10-3 and 10-4 year-1, respectively.

1204.4390,astro-ph,"In the context of planet formation, anticyclonic vortices have recently received lots of attention for the role they can play in planetesimals formation. Radial migration of intermediate size solids toward the central star may prevent their growth to larger solid grains. On the other hand, vortices can trap the dust and accelerate this growth, counteracting fast radial transport. Multiple effects have been shown to affect this scenario, such as vortex migration or decay. The aim of this paper is to study the formation of vortices by the Rossby wave instability and their long term evolution in a full three dimensional protoplanetary disc. We use a robust numerical scheme combined with adaptive mesh refinement in cylindrical coordinates, allowing to affordably compute long term 3D evolutions. We consider a full disc stratified both radially and vertically that is prone to formation of vortices by the Rossby wave instability. We show that the 3D Rossby vortices grow and survive over hundreds of years without migration. The localized overdensity which initiated the instability and vortex formation survives the growth of the Rossby wave instability for very long times. When the vortices are no longer sustained by the Rossby wave instability, their shape changes toward more elliptical vortices. This allows them to survive shear-driven destruction, but they may be prone to elliptical instability and slow decay. When the conditions for growing Rossby wave-related instabilities are maintained in the disc, large-scale vortices can survive over very long timescales and may be able to concentrate solids.",12,[],1

The NFW concentration parameter increases with decreasing satellite luminosity while being independent of the luminosity of the primary except for very bright primaries. The profiles of the faintest satellites show deviations from the NFW form with an excess at small galactocentric projected distances. In addition, we quantify how the radial distribution of satellites depends on the colour of the satellites and on the colour and concentration of their primaries.",12,[],1
1210.1167,astro-ph,"PSR J1910-5959A is a binary pulsar with a helium white dwarf companion located about 6 arcmin from the center of the globular cluster NGC6752. Based on 12 years of observations at the Parkes radio telescope, the relativistic Shapiro delay has been detected in this system. We obtain a companion mass Mc = 0.180/-0.018Msun (1sigma) implying that the pulsar mass lies in the range 1.1Msun <= Mp <= 1.5Msun. We compare our results with previous optical determinations of the companion mass, and examine prospects for using this new measurement for calibrating the mass-radius relation for helium white dwarfs and for investigating their evolution in a pulsar binary system. Finally we examine the set of binary systems hosting a millisecond pulsar and a low mass helium white dwarf for which the mass of both stars has been measured. We confirm that the correlation between the companion mass and the orbital period predicted by Tauris & Savonije reproduces the observed values but find that the predicted Mp - Pb correlation over-estimates the neutron star mass by about 0.5Msun in the orbital period range covered by the observations. Moreover, a few systems do not obey the observed Mp - Pb correlation. We discuss these results in the framework of the mechanisms that inhibit the accretion of matter by a neutron star during its evolution in a low-mass X-ray binary.",12,[],1
1207.4963,astro-ph,"In this paper, we characterize the infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of mid-IR selected z~0.3-3.0 and LIR~1011-1013Lsun galaxies, and study how their SEDs differ from those of local and high-z analogs. Our mid-IR flux-limited sample of 191 sources is unique in size, and spectral coverage, including Spitzer mid-IR spectroscopy. Here we add Herschel photometry at 250um, 350um, and 500um, which allows us to obtain accurate total IR luminosities, as well as constrain the relative contributions of AGN and starbursts to those luminosities. Our sample constitutes ~23% AGN (i.e. where the AGN contributes >50% of LIR), ~30% starbursts (where AGN contributes <20% of LIR and the mid-IR spectra are starburst-like); and ~47% composites (which show both significant AGN and starburst activity). The AGN-dominated sources divide into ones that show a strong silicate 9.7um absorption feature, implying highly obscured systems, and ones that do not. The high-tau9.7 sources are half of our z>1.2 AGN, but show SEDs that are extremely rare among local AGN. The SEDs of our z~2 starburst-dominated ULIRGs are much closer to those of local LIRGs than ULIRGs. This is consistent with our earlier finding that, unlike local ULIRGs, our high-z starbursts are typically only in the early stages of a merger. The SEDs of the composite sources are most similar to the local archetypal warm ULIRG, Mrk231. In summary, our results show that there is strong evolution in the SEDs between local and z~2 IR-luminous galaxies, as well as that there is a wide range of SEDs among high redshift IR-luminous sources. The publicly-available SED templates we derive from our sample will be particularly useful for infrared population synthesis models, as well as in the interpretation of other mid-IR high-z galaxies in particular those detected by the recent all sky WISE survey.",12,[],1
1210.5880,astro-ph,"Thanks to the asteroseimic study of the red giant star KIC 7341231 observed by Kepler, it has been possible to infer its radial differential rotation profile (Deheuvels et al. 2012). This opens new ways to constrain the physical mechanisms responsible of the angular momentum transport in stellar interiors by directly comparing this radial rotation profile with the ones computed using stellar evolution codes including dynamical processes. In this preliminary work, we computed different models of KIC 7341231 with the Geneva stellar evolution code that includes transport mechanisms due to a shellular rotation and the associated large-scale meridional circulation and shear-induced turbulence. Once the global parameters of the star had been established, we modified some of the model's input parameters in order to understand their effects on the predicted rotation profile of the modeled star. As a result, we find a discrepancy between the rotation profile deduced from asteroseismic measurements and the profiles predicted from models including shellular rotation and related meridional flows and turbulence. This indicates that a most powerful mechanism is in action to extract angular momentum from the core of this star.",12,[],1
1206.2950,astro-ph,"We have evaluated the contribution of the AGN population to the ionization history of the Universe based on a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation and evolution in the CDM cosmological scenario. The model connects the growth of black holes and of the ensuing AGN activity to galaxy interactions. In the model we have included a self consistent physical description of the escape of ionizing UV photons; this is based on the blast-wave model for the AGN feedback we developed in a previous paper to explain the distribution of hydrogen column densities in AGNs of various redshifts and luminosities, due to absorption by the host galaxy gas. The model predicts UV luminosity functions for AGNs which are in good agreement with those derived from the observations especially at low and intermediate redshifts (z=3). At higher redshifts (z>5) the model tends to overestimate the data at faint luminosities. Critical biases both in the data and in the model are discussed to explain such apparent discrepancies. The predicted hydrogen photoionization rate as a function of redshift is found to be consistent with that derived from the observations. All that suggests to reconsider the role of the AGNs as the main driver of the ionization history of the Universe.",12,[],1

1204.1152,astro-ph,"We use Herschel-PACS far-infrared data, combined with previous multi-band information and mid-IR spectra, to properly account for the presence of an active nucleus and constrain its energetic contribution in luminous infrared (IR) sources at z\sim2. The sample is composed of 24 sources in the GOODS-South field, with typical IR luminosity of 1012 Lo. Data from the 4 Ms Chandra X-ray imaging in this field are also used to identify and characterize AGN emission. We reproduce the observed spectral energy distribution (SED), decomposed into a host-galaxy and an AGN component. A smooth-torus model for circum-nuclear dust is used to account for the direct and re-processed contribution from the AGN. We confirm that galaxies with typical L8-1000um\sim1012Lo at z\sim2 are powered predominantly by star-formation. An AGN component is present in nine objects (\sim35% of the sample) at the 3sigma confidence level, but its contribution to the 8-1000 um emission accounts for only \sim5% of the energy budget. The AGN contribution rises to \sim23% over the 5-30 um range (in agreement with Spitzer IRS results) and to \sim60% over the narrow 2-6 um range. The presence of an AGN is confirmed by X-ray data for 3 (out of nine) sources, with X-ray spectral analysis indicating the presence of significant absorption, i.e. NH\sim1023-1024 cm-2. An additional source shows indications of obscured AGN emission from X-ray data. The comparison between the mid-IR--derived X-ray luminosities and those obtained from X-ray data suggests that obscuration is likely present also in the remaining six sources that harbour an AGN according to the SED-fitting analysis.",12,[],1
1209.3269,astro-ph,"We present results from a deep Suzaku observation of the black hole in LMC X-1, supplemented by coincident monitoring with RXTE. We identify broad relativistic reflection features in a soft disc-dominated spectrum. A strong and variable power-law component of emission is present which we use to demonstrate that enhanced Comptonisation strengthens disc reflection. We constrain the spin parameter of the black hole by modelling LMC X-1's broad reflection features. For our primary and most comprehensive spectral model, we obtain a high value for the spin: a* = 0.97(0.01,-0.13) (68 per cent confidence). However, by additionally considering two alternate models as a measure of our systematic uncertainty, we obtain a broader constraint: a* = 0.97(0.02,-0.25). Both of these spin values are entirely consistent with a previous estimate of spin obtained using the continuum-fitting method. At 99 per cent confidence, the reflection features require a* > 0.2. In addition to modelling the relativistically broadened reflection, we also model a sharp and prominent reflection component that provides strong evidence for substantial reprocessing in the wind of the massive companion. We infer that this wind sustains the ionisation cone surrounding the binary system; this hypothesis naturally produces appropriate and consistent mass, time, and length scales for the cone structure.",12,['gr-qc'],1
1203.4261,astro-ph,"This is part two in a series of papers in which we investigate an approach based on Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT) to study the non-linear evolution of the large-scale structure distribution in the universe. Firstly, we compute the matter bispectrum in real space using LPT up one-loop order, for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian initial conditions. In the initial position limit, we find that the one-loop bispectrum computed in this manner is identical to its counterpart obtained from standard Eulerian perturbation theory (SPT). Furthermore, the LPT formalism allows for a simple reorganisation of the perturbative series corresponding to the resummation of an infinite series of perturbations in SPT. Applying this method, we find a resummed one-loop bispectrum that compares favourably with results from N-body simulations. We generalise the resummation method also to the computation of the redshift-space bispectrum up to one loop.",12,[],1
1206.0876,astro-ph,"Context. Since the advent of modern multiband digital sky surveys, photometric redshifts (photo-z's) have become relevant if not crucial to many fields of observational cosmology, from the characterization of cosmic structures, to weak and strong lensing. Aims. We describe an application to an astrophysical context, namely the evaluation of photometric redshifts, of MLPQNA, a machine learning method based on Quasi Newton Algorithm. Methods. Theoretical methods for photo-z's evaluation are based on the interpolation of a priori knowledge (spectroscopic redshifts or SED templates) and represent an ideal comparison ground for neural networks based methods. The MultiLayer Perceptron with Quasi Newton learning rule (MLPQNA) described here is a computing effective implementation of Neural Networks for the first time exploited to solve regression problems in the astrophysical context and is offered to the community through the DAMEWARE (DAta Mining & ExplorationWeb Application REsource) infrastructure. Results. The PHAT contest (Hildebrandt et al. 2010) provides a standard dataset to test old and new methods for photometric redshift evaluation and with a set of statistical indicators which allow a straightforward comparison among different methods. The MLPQNA model has been applied on the whole PHAT1 dataset of 1984 objects after an optimization of the model performed by using as training set the 515 available spectroscopic redshifts. When applied to the PHAT1 dataset, MLPQNA obtains the best bias accuracy (0.0006) and very competitive accuracies in terms of scatter (0.056) and outlier percentage (16.3%), scoring as the second most effective empirical method among those which have so far participated to the contest.

1212.3907,astro-ph,"N-body simulations predict that dark matter halos with different mass scales are described by a universal model, the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profiles. As a consequence of baryonic cooling effects, the halos will become more concentrated, and similar to an isothermal sphere over large range in radii (equation equationkpc). The singular isothermal sphere model however has to be truncated artificially at large radii since it extends to infinity. We model a massive galaxy halo as a combination of an isothermal sphere and an NFW density profile. We give an approximation for the mass concentration at different baryon fractions and present exact expressions for the weak lensing shear and flexion for such a halo. We compare the lensing properties with a Singular Isothermal Sphere and NFW profiles. We find that the combined profile can generate higher order lensing signals at small radii and is more efficient in generating strong lensing events. In order to distinguish such a halo profile from the SIS or NFW profiles, one needs to combine strong and weak lensing constraints on small and large radii.",12,[],1

This paper describes HARP observations of the J = 3-2 transitions of 13CO and C18O towards Orion A. The 1500-resolution observations cover 5 pc of the Orion filament, including OMC1 (inc. BN-KL and Orion Bar), OMC 2/3 and OMC 4, and allow a comparative study of the molecular gas properties throughout the star-forming cloud. The filament shows a velocity gradient of ~1 km/s /pc between OMC 1, 2 and 3, and high velocity emission is detected in both isotopologues. The Orion Nebula and Bar have the largest masses and line widths, and dominate the mass and energetics of the high velocity material. Compact, spatially resolved emission from CH3CN, 13CH3OH, SO, HCOOCH3, C2H5OH, CH3CHO and CH3OCHO is detected towards the Orion Hot Core. The cloud is warm, with a median excitation temperature of ~24 K; the Orion Bar has the highest excitation temperature gas, at >80 K. The C18O excitation temperature correlates well with the dust temperature (to within 40%). The C18O emission is optically thin, and the 13CO emission is marginally optically thick; despite its high mass, OMC 1 shows the lowest opacities. A virial analysis indicates that Orion A is too massive for thermal or turbulent support, but is consistent with a model of a filamentary cloud that is threaded by helical magnetic fields. The variation of physical conditions across the cloud is reflected in the physical characteristics of the dust cores....continued",12,[],1
1210.5303,astro-ph,"We perform a detailed elemental abundance study of the early-type B star HD 28248 and estimate its orbital path in the Galaxy. From the comparison of spectroscopic observations performed at the European Southern Observatory at La Silla in 2001/Oct/07 with non-LTE synthetic spectra using a new wrapper for the simultaneous fitting of several lines of a given atomic species, the abundances of He, C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Ar and Fe were determined for the first time.

Our chemical analysis depicted an outstanding enrichment of several atomic species, particularly [Fe/H] = 0.25 dex and [O/Fe] = 0.32 dex. The kinematic parameters show that its orbit is confined to the galactic disk with a scale height of 400 pc and the star has moved about 4 kpc from its birthplace to the current position.

1207.2673,astro-ph,"CONTEXT: The attachment of free electrons to polycondensed aromatic ring molecules (PAHs) is studied for the variety of these molecules with different numbers of condensed rings and over a broad range of electron temperatures, using a multichannel quantum scattering approach. The calculations of the relevant cross sections are used in turn to model the corresponding attachment rates for each of the systems under study, and these rates are parametrized as a function of temperature using a commonly employed expression for two-body processes in the interstellar medium (ISM). AIM: The scope of this work is to use first principles to establish the influence of chemical properties on the efficiency of the electron-attachment process for PAHs. METHODS: Quantum multichannel scattering methods are employed to generate the relevant cross sections, hence the attachment rates, using integral elastic cross sections computed over a broad range of relevant energies, from threshold up to 1000 K and linking the attachment to low-energy resonant collisions. RESULTS: The rates obtained for the present molecules are found to markedly vary within the test ensemble of the present work and to be lower than the earlier values used for the entire class of PAHs anions, when modelling their evolutions in ISM environments. The effects of such differences on the evolutions of chemical networks that include both PAH and PAH- species are analysed in some detail and related to previous calculations.",12,[],1
1210.6706,astro-ph,"We present a new method to identify and characterize the structure of the intracluster medium (ICM) in simulated galaxy clusters. The method uses the median of gas properties, such as density and pressure, which we show to be very robust to the presence of gas inhomogeneities. In particular, we show that the radial profiles of median gas properties are smooth and do not exhibit fluctuations at locations of massive clumps in contrast to mean and mode properties. It is shown that distribution of gas properties in a given radial shell can be well described by a log-normal PDF and a tail. The former corresponds to a nearly hydrostatic bulk component, accounting for ~99% of the volume, while the tail corresponds to high density inhomogeneities. We show that this results in a simple and robust separation of the diffuse and clumpy components of the ICM. The FWHM of the density distribution grows with radius and varies from ~0.15 dex in cluster centre to ~0.5 dex at 2r500 in relaxed clusters. The small scatter in the width between relaxed clusters suggests that the degree of inhomogeneity is a robust characteristic of the ICM. It broadly agrees with the amplitude of density perturbations in the Coma cluster. We discuss the origin of ICM density variations in spherical shells and show that less than 20% of the width can be attributed to the triaxiality of the cluster gravitational potential. As a link to X-ray observations of real clusters we evaluated the ICM clumping factor with and without high density inhomogeneities. We argue that these two cases represent upper and lower limits on the departure of the observed X-ray emissivity from the median value. We find that the typical value of the clumping factor in the bulk component of relaxed clusters varies from ~1.1-1.2 at r500 up to ~1.3-1.4 at r200, in broad agreement with recent observations.",12,[],1
1201.5374,astro-ph,"Thompson scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons off of free electrons during the reionization epoch induces a correlation between the distribution of galaxies and the polarization pattern of the CMB, the magnitude of which is proportional to the quadrupole moment of radiation at the time of scattering. Since the quadrupole moment generated by gravitational waves (GWs) gives rise to a different polarization pattern than that produced by scalar modes, one can put interesting constraints on the strength of GWs on large scales by cross-correlating the small scale galaxy distribution and CMB polarization. We use this method together with Fisher analysis to predict how well future surveys can measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio equation. We find that with a future CMB experiment with detector noise DeltaP = 2 mu K-arcmin and a beam width thetaFWHM = 2' and a future galaxy survey with limiting magnitude I<25.6 one can measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio with an error sigmar \simeq 0.09. To measure r \approx 0.01, however, one needs DeltaP \simeq 0.5 mu K-radian and thetaFWHM \simeq 1'. We also investigate a few systematic effects, none of which turn out to add any biases to our estimators, but they increase the error bars by adding to the cosmic variance. The incomplete sky coverage has the most dramatic effect on our constraints on r for large sky cuts, with a reduction in signal-to-noise smaller than one would expect from the naive estimate (S/N)2 \propto fsky. Specifically, we find a degradation factor of fdeg=0.32  0.01 for a sky cut of b>10\circ (fsky=0.83) and fdeg=0.056  0.004 for a sky cut of b>20\circ (fsky=0.66).

The MBH mass density at different redshifts can also be inferred from the luminosity function of QSOs/AGNs provided known radiative efficiency letter.

Our results suggest that the MBH mass growth precedes the bulge mass growth but the galaxy velocity dispersion does not increase with the mass growth of the bulge after the quench of nuclear activity, which is roughly consistent with the two-phase galaxy formation scenario proposed by Oser et al.

The new IRAC criteria are designed to be both highly complete and reliable, and incorporate the best aspects of the current AGN selection wedges and of infrared power-law selection while excluding high redshift star-forming galaxies selected via the BzK, DRG, LBG, and SMG criteria.

X-ray stacking of the individually X-ray non-detected AGN candidates leads to a hard X-ray signal indicative of heavily obscured to mildly Compton-thick obscuration (log NH (cm-2) = 23.5 /- 0.4).

1205.1194,astro-ph,"The Galaxy hosts a widespread population of low-energy positrons revealed by successive generations of gamma-ray telescopes through a bright annihilation emission from the bulge region, with a fainter contribution from the inner disk. The exact origin of these particles remains currently unknown. We estimate the contribution to the annihilation signal of positrons generated in the decay of radioactive 26Al, 56Ni and 44Ti. We adapted the GALPROP propagation code to simulate the transport and annihilation of radioactivity positrons in a model of our Galaxy. Using plausible source spatial distributions, we explored several possible propagation scenarios to account for the large uncertainties on the transport of ~1MeV positrons in the interstellar medium. We then compared the predicted intensity distributions to the INTEGRAL/SPI observations. We obtain similar intensity distributions with small bulge-to-disk ratios, even for extreme large-scale transport prescriptions. At least half of the positrons annihilate close to their sources, even when they are allowed to travel far away. In the high-diffusion, ballistic case, up to 40% of them escape the Galaxy. In proportion, this affects bulge positrons more than disk positrons because they are injected further off the plane in a tenuous medium, while disk positrons are mostly injected in the dense molecular ring. The predicted intensity distributions are fully consistent with the observed longitudinally-extended disk-like emission, but the transport scenario cannot be strongly constrained by the current data. Nucleosynthesis positrons alone cannot account for the observed annihilation emission in the frame of our model. An additional component is needed to explain the strong bulge contribution, and the latter is very likely concentrated in the central regions if positrons have initial energies in the 100keV-1MeV range.",12,[],1

The entire evolution of several nova outbursts has been observed with the Swift XRT and UVOT instruments, allowing studies of the gradual shift of the peak of the SED from UV to X-rays, time scales to the onset and duration of the X-ray brightest supersoft source (SSS) phase, and pre- and post-SSS X-ray emission. In addition, XMM-Newton and Chandra observations can efficiently be scheduled, allowing deeper studies of strategically chosen evolutionary stages.

More systematic Swift studies reduced this number while increasing the number of novae.

Two sources (SWIFT J2237.26324 and SWIFT J2341.07645) are shown to belong to the class of cataclysmic variables (suspected polars or intermediate polars).

1204.0658,astro-ph,"We study the amplification of magnetic fields during the formation of primordial halos. The turbulence generated by gravitational infall motions during the formation of the first stars and galaxies can amplify magnetic fields very efficiently and on short timescales up to dynamically significant values. Using the Kazantsev theory, which describes the so-called small-scale dynamo - a magnetohydrodynamical process converting kinetic energy from turbulence into magnetic energy - we can then calculate the growth rate of the small-scale magnetic field. Our calculations are based on a detailed chemical network and we include non-ideal magnetohydrodynamical effects such as ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation. We follow the evolution of the magnetic field up to larger scales until saturation occurs on the Jeans scale. Assuming a weak magnetic seed field generated by the Biermann battery process, both Burgers and Kolmogorov turbulence lead to saturation within a rather small density range. Such fields are likely to become relevant after the formation of a protostellar disk and, thus, could influence the formation of the first stars and galaxies in the Universe.",12,['physics'],1
1202.4670,astro-ph,"We use the 2011 Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) proportional counter array (PCA) data of the 401 Hz accreting pulsar and burster IGR J17498-2921 to perform timing analysis and time-resolved spectroscopy of 12 thermonuclear X-ray bursts. We confirm previously reported burst oscillations from this source with a much higher significance (8.8letter). We notice that the bursts can be divided into three groups: big photospheric radius expansion (PRE) bursts are about ten times more luminous than medium bursts, while the latter are about ten times more luminous than small bursts. The PCA field-of-view of these observations contains several known bursters, and hence some of the observed bursts might not be from IGR J17498-2921. The oscillations during big bursts at the known pulsar frequency show that these bursts were definitely from IGR J17498-2921. We find that at least several of the other bursts were also likely originated from IGR J17498-2921. Spectral analysis reveals that the luminosity differences among various bursts are primarily due to differences in normalizations, and not temperatures, even when we consider the effects of colour factor. This shows burning on a fraction of the stellar surface for those small and medium bursts, which originated from IGR J17498-2921. The low values of the upper limits of burst oscillation amplitude for these bursts suggest a small angle between the spin axis and the magnetic axis. We find indications of the PRE nature of a medium burst, which likely originated from IGR J17498-2921. If true, then, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that two PRE bursts with a peak count rate ratio of as high as \approx 12 have been detected from the same source.",12,[],1

Imposing a local constraint on the dynamics has the surprising effect of speeding up the phase ordering process. The system is shown to exhibit a scaling regime characterized by algebraic domain growth, at odds with the logarithmic coarsening of the standard voter model. A phenomenological approach based on cluster diffusion and similar to Smoluchowski ripening correctly predicts the observed scaling regime.

We report the density functional structural prediction of the unexpected stabilization of a diamondoid (or N10-cage) structure of polymeric nitrogen at high pressures. The structure adopts a highly symmetric body-centered cubic form with lattice sites occupied by N10 tetracyclic cages, each of which consists of 10 atoms and is covalently bonded with its six next-nearest N10 cages. The prediction of this diamondoid structure rules out the earlier proposed helical tunnel phase and demonstrates the high-order nature of polymeric nitrogen at extreme high pressures.

1207.6163,cond-mat,"Quantum fluctuations give rise to van der Waals and Casimir forces that dominate the interaction between electrically neutral objects at sub-micron separations. Under the trend of miniaturization, such quantum electrodynamical effects are expected to play an important role in micro- and nano-mechanical devices. Nevertheless, utilization of Casimir forces on the chip level remains a major challenge because all experiments so far require an external object to be manually positioned close to the mechanical element. Here, by integrating a force-sensing micromechanical beam and an electrostatic actuator on a single chip, we demonstrate the Casimir effect between two micromachined silicon components on the same substrate. A high degree of parallelism between the two near-planar interacting surfaces can be achieved because they are defined in a single lithographic step.

1201.0677,cond-mat,"We study the interplay between magnetic frustration and itinerant electrons. For example, how does the coupling to mobile charges modify the properties of a spin liquid, and does the underlying frustration favor insulating or conducting states? Supported by Monte Carlo simulations, our goal is in particular to provide an analytical picture of the mechanisms involved. The models under considerations exhibit Coulomb phases in two and three dimensions, where the itinerant electrons are coupled to the localized spins via double exchange interactions. Because of the Hund coupling, magnetic loops naturally emerge from the Coulomb phase and serve as conducting channels for the mobile electrons, leading to doping-dependent rearrangements of the loop ensemble in order to minimize the electronic kinetic energy. At low electron density letter, the double exchange coupling mainly tends to segment the very long loops winding around the system into smaller ones while it gradually lifts the extensive degeneracy of the Coulomb phase with increasing letter. For higher doping, the results are strongly lattice dependent, displaying loop crystals with a given loop length for some specific values of letter, which can melt into another loop crystal by varying letter. Finally, we contrast this to the qualitatively different behavior of analogous models on kagome or triangular lattices.",12,[],8

Increasing the strength of the interaction leads to a softening of an excitation mode at a finite momentum, preceding a superfluid to supersolid phase transition. We study the mode softening spectroscopically across the phase transition using a variant of Bragg spectroscopy. The measured spectrum is in very good agreement with ab initio calculations and, at the phase transition, a diverging susceptibility is observed.

We propose that this local variation reflects a high density of nano-twins, short-ranged structures which locally affect the magnetic alignment.

1203.4633,cond-mat,"Rolling of a small sphere on a solid support is governed by a non-linear friction that is akin to the Coulombic dry fiction. No motion occurs when the external field is weaker than the frictional resistance. However, with the intervention of an external noise, a viscous friction like property emerges; thus the sphere rolls with an uniform drift velocity that is proportional to the applied field. As the sphere rolls, it rocks forward and backward resulting in substantial fluctuation of displacement opposite to the net drift. The ratio of the integrated probabilities of the negative to positive work fluctuations decreases monotonically with the time of observation, from which a temperature like intensive parameter can be estimated. This parameter conforms to the Einstein's ratio of diffusivity and mobility that increases almost linearly, even though the diffusivity increases super-linearly, with the strength of the noise. A new barrier crossing experiment is introduced that can be performed either with a hard (e.g. a steel ball) or with a soft (e.g. a water drop) sphere in contact with a periodically undulated substrate. The frequency of barrier crossing follows the classical transition state equation allowing a direct estimation of the effective temperature. These experiments as well as certain numerical simulations suggest that the effective temperature of a system controlled by a non-linear friction may not have a unique value.",12,['physics'],8

1202.4779,cond-mat,"The accurate description of the optical spectra of insulators and semiconductors remains an important challenge for time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT). Evidence has been given in the literature that TDDFT can produce bound as well as continuum excitons for specific systems, but there are still many unresolved basic questions concerning the role of dynamical exchange and correlation (xc). In particular, the role of the long spatial range and the frequency dependence of the xc kernel equation for excitonic binding are still not very well explored. We present a minimal model for excitons in TDDFT, consisting of two bands from a one-dimensional Kronig-Penney model and simple approximate xc kernels, which allows us to address these questions in a transparent manner. Depending on the system, it is found that adiabatic xc kernels can produce a single bound exciton, and sometimes two bound excitons, where the long spatial range of equation is not a necessary condition. It is shown how the Wannier model, featuring an effective electron-hole interaction, emerges from TDDFT. The collective, many-body nature of excitons is explicitly demonstrated.",12,[],8

We demonstrate this difference for finite width graphene nanoribbons and a single polyethylene chain comparing results of the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with harmonic potentials and the finite element method with the beam model. We also find that the difference strongly depends on the loading modes, chirality and width of the graphene nanoribbons, and it increases with decreasing width of the nanoribbons under pure bending condition. The maximum difference of the predicted mechanical properties using the two models can exceed 300% in different loading modes. Comparing the two models with the MD results of AIREBO potential, we find that the stick-spiral model overestimates and the beam model underestimates the mechanical properties in narrow armchair graphene nanoribbons under pure bending condition.",12,['cs'],8

1204.2286,cond-mat,"In bilayer graphene, the phase diagram in the plane of a strain-induced bare nematic term, equation, and a top-bottom gates voltage imbalance, equation, is obtained by solving the gap equation in the random-phase approximation.

The corresponding phases are separated by a critical line of first- and second-order phase transitions at small and large values of equation, respectively. The existence of a critical end point, where the line of first-order phase transitions terminates, is predicted. For equation, a pure gapped state with a broken spin-valley symmetry is the ground state of the system. As equation increases, the nematic order parameter increases, and the gap weakens in the hybrid state. For equation, a quantum second-order phase transition from the hybrid state into a pure gapless nematic state occurs when the strain reaches a critical value. A nonzero equation suppresses the critical value of the strain. The relevance of these results to recent experiments is briefly discussed.",12,['hep-ph'],8

With nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction equation alone (U=0), the system develops intra-unit-cell charge density wave order for small equation, s-wave superconductivity for moderate equation, and the charge density wave order appears again for even larger equation. With both equation and equation, we also find spin bond order and chiral equation superconductivity in some particular regimes of the phase diagram. We find that the s-wave superconductivity is a result of charge density wave fluctuations and the squared logarithmic divergence in the pairing susceptibility. On the other hand, the d-wave superconductivity follows from bond order fluctuations that avoid the matrix element effect.

1207.3647,cond-mat,"We consider a model fluid with long-ranged, dispersion interparticle potentials confined between competing parallel walls. One wall is solvophilic and would be completely wet at bulk liquid-gas coexistence while the other is solvophobic and would be completely dry at bulk coexistence. When the wall separation L is large and the system is below the bulk critical temperature and close to bulk liquid-gas coexistence, a `delocalized interface' or `soft mode' phase forms with a liquid-gas interface near to the centre of the slit; this interacts with the walls via the power-law tails of the interparticle potentials. We use a coarse-grained effective Hamiltonian approach to derive explicit scaling expressions for the Gibbs adsorption, the surface tension, the solvation force and the total susceptibility. Using a non-local density functional theory (DFT) we calculate density profiles for the asymmetrically confined fluid at different chemical potentials and, for sufficiently large L, confirm the scaling predictions for the four thermodynamic quantities. Since the upper critical dimension for complete wetting with power-law potentials is <3 we argue that our (mean-field) scaling predictions should remain valid in treatments that incorporate the effects of interfacial fluctuations. As the wall separation L is decreased at bulk liquid-gas coexistence we predict a capillary evaporation transition from the `delocalized interface' phase to a dilute gas state with just a thin adsorbed film of liquid-like density next to the solvophilic wall. This transition is connected closely to the first order pre-wetting transition which occurs at the solvophilic wall in the semi-infinite system.

For a single aperture, the current-phase equation for driven flow contains sinusoidal, linear, and current-bias contributions. We compute the renormalization group (RG) beta function of the periodic potential in the effective action for small tunneling amplitudes and use this to analyze the temperature dependence of the low-energy current-phase relation, with application to the transition from linear to sinusoidal current-phase behavior observed in experiments by Hoskinson et al. \citepackard for liquid equationHe driven through nanoaperture arrays. Extension of the microscopic theory to a two-aperture array shows that interference between the microscopic tunneling contributions for individual apertures leads to an effective coupling between apertures which amplifies the Josephson oscillations in the array.

The presence of additional surface dopants breaks this approximate electron-hole symmetry and dramatically affects the magnitude of the band bending. Applying a gate potential can generate a depletion zone characterized by a vanishing carrier density. We find that the density profile in the transition zone between the depleted region and the bulk is independent of the applied potential. In thin films the electrostatic effects are strongly dependent on the carrier charge density.

1204.3150,cond-mat,"The nearly well-ordered double perovskite LaequationCrFeOequation has been synthesized recently. Contrary to previous theoretical predictions, but in agreement with experimental observations, our first principle calculations indicate an insulating ferrimagnet LaequationCrFeOequation with antialigned S=3/2 Crequation and S=5/2 Feequation ions,using the local spin density approximation (LSDA), a correlated band theory LDAU, and a semilocal functional modified Becke-Johnson method. Additionally, we investigated the double perovskite SrequationCrFeOequation, which is as yet unsynthesized. In LSDA calculations, this system shows formally tetravalent Cr and Fe ions both having antialigned equation=1 moments, but is a simple metal. Once applying on-site Coulomb repulsion U on both Cr and Fe ions, this system becomes half-metallic and the moment of Fe is substantially reduced, resulting in zero net moment. These results are consistent with our fixed spin moment studies. Our results suggest a precisely compensated half-metallic SrequationCrFeOequation.",12,[],8
1208.5684,cond-mat,"We perform classical molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the enhancement of the mass sensitivity and resonant frequency of graphene nanomechanical resonators that is achieved by driving them into the nonlinear oscillation regime. The mass sensitivity as measured by the resonant frequency shift is found to triple if the actuation energy is about 2.5 times the initial kinetic energy of the nanoresonator. The mechanism underlying the enhanced mass sensitivity is found to be the effective strain that is induced in the nanoresonator due to the nonlinear oscillations, where we obtain an analytic relationship between the induced effective strain and the actuation energy that is applied to the graphene nanoresonator. An important implication of this work is that there is no need for experimentalists to apply tensile strain to the resonators before actuation in order to enhance the mass sensitivity. Instead, enhanced mass sensitivity can be obtained by the far simpler technique of actuating nonlinear oscillations of an existing graphene nanoresonator.",12,[],8

1205.3622,cond-mat,"The discovery in 1991 of high temperature superconductivity (SC) in A3C60 compounds, where A is an alkali ion, has been rapidly ascribed to a BCS mechanism, in which the pairing is mediated by on ball optical phonon modes. While this has lead to consider that electronic correlations were not important in these compounds, further studies of various AnC60 with n=1, 2, 4 allowed to evidence that their electronic properties cannot be explained by a simple progressive band filling of the C60 six-fold degenerate t1u molecular level. This could only be ascribed to the simultaneous influence of electron correlations and Jahn-Teller Distortions (JTD) of the C60 ball, which energetically favour evenly charged C60 molecules. This is underlined by the recent discovery of two expanded fulleride Cs3C60 isomeric phases which are Mott insulators at ambient pressure. Both phases undergo a pressure induced first order Mott transition to SC with a (p, T) phase diagram displaying a dome shaped SC, a common situation encountered nowadays in correlated electron systems. NMR experiments allowed us to study the magnetic properties of the Mott phases and to evidence clear deviations from BCS expectations near the Mott transition. So, although SC involves an electron-phonon mechanism, the incidence of electron correlations has an importance on the electronic properties, as had been anticipated from DMFT calculations.",12,[],8

We use an inhomogeneous Gutzwiller approximation for a single band Hubbard model in order to describe correlation effects. For low doping, the bulk value of the quasiparticle weight is recovered exponentially deep into the slab, but with increasing doping, additional Friedel oscillations appear near the surface. We show that the inverse correlation length has a power-law dependence on the doping level. In the presence of an electrical field, considerable changes in the quasiparticle weight can be realized throughout the system. We observe a large difference (as large as five orders of magnitude) in the quasiparticle weight near the opposite sides of the slab.

The hysteresis are related to the confinement of quantized incommensurate spin density waves (ISDW) in the film thickness. Our important finding is to experimentally show that the temperature equation where the ISDW changes from equation to equation\,\,1 nodes \it decreases as the film thickness \it increases. Identifying equation with a first order transition between ISDW states with equation and equation\,\,1 nodes, and using a Landau approach to the free energy of the ISDW together with Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the system at high temperatures explores all available modes for the ISDW, freezing out in one particular mode at a transition temperature that indeed decreases with film thickness, equation.

The efficiency is further tempered by randomly positioned off-axis quantum emitters. Here, we present perfectly positioned single quantum dots on the axis of a tailored nanowire waveguide using bottom-up growth. In comparison to quantum dots in nanowires without waveguide, we demonstrate a 24-fold enhancement in the single photon flux, corresponding to a light extraction efficiency of 42 %.

1203.3201,cond-mat,"A system of interacting, identical fermions described by standard Landau Fermi-liquid (FL) theory can experience a rearrangement of its Fermi surface if the correlations grow sufficiently strong, as occurs at a quantum critical point where the effective mass diverges. As yet, this phenomenon defies full understanding, but salient aspects of the non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior observed beyond the quantum critical point are still accessible within the general framework of the Landau quasiparticle picture. Self-consistent solutions of the coupled Landau equations for the quasiparticle momentum distribution equation and quasiparticle energy spectrum equation are shown to exist in two distinct classes, depending on coupling strength and on whether the quasiparticle interaction is regular or singular at zero momentum transfer. One class of solutions maintains the idempotency condition equation of standard FL theory at zero temperature equation while adding pockets to the Fermi surface. The other solutions are characterized by a swelling of the Fermi surface and a flattening of the spectrum equation over a range of momenta in which the quasiparticle occupancies lie between 0 and 1 even at T=0. The latter, non-idempotent solution is revealed by analysis of a Poincar\'e mapping associated with the fundamental Landau equation connecting equation and equation and validated by solution of a variational condition that yields the symmetry-preserving ground state. Paradoxically, this extraordinary solution carries the burden of a large temperature-dependent excess entropy down to very low temperatures, threatening violation of the Nernst Theorem. It is argued that certain low-temperature phase transitions offer effective mechanisms for shedding the entropy excess. Available measurements in heavy-fermion compounds provide concrete support for such a scenario.",12,[],8

Whereas the radial representation of the Barnes slave bosons has been investigated before, a setup for the functional integral of radial bosonic fields in the more physical Kotliar-Ruckenstein representation has not been accomplished to date. We implement a path integral procedure with suitable renormalization factors for a strongly correlated two-site model which allows to control the formal steps in the intricate evaluation, as the results for the partition function and the expectation values are known from exact diagonalization for such a minimal single impurity Anderson model.

A quantum phase transition (QPT) from a TI to a conventional insulator and a change in topological class can only occur when the bulk band gap closes. In this work, we have utilized time-domain terahertz spectroscopy (TDTS) to investigate the low frequency conductance in (BiequationInequation)equationSeequation as we tune through this transition by indium substitution. Above certain substitution levels we observe a collapse in the transport lifetime that indicates the destruction of the topological phase. We associate this effect with the threshold where states from opposite surfaces hybridize. The substitution level of the threshold is thickness dependent and only asymptotically approaches the bulk limit equation where a maximum in the mid-infrared absorption is exhibited. This absorption can be identified with the bulk band gap closing and a change in topological class. The correlation length associated with the QPT appears as the evanescent length of the surface states. The observation of the thickness-dependent collapse of the transport lifetime shows the unusual role that finite size effects play in this topological QPT.",12,[],8

The nanoparticles were produced in two hydrodynamic sizes with differing core morphologies by varying the synthetic method as either a two-step or single step process. A striking benefit of these methods is the ability to obtain swift and consistent results without the necessity for air, pH, or temperature sensitive techniques; therefore, reaction times and complex manufacturing processes are greatly reduced as compared to conventional synthetic methods.

Besides the wavenumber equation relying on the 1D electron, one accounts for the equation 1 - factors in the front of the square root term of the energy. Electronic structure properties of quasi 1D semiconductor heterostructures like InAs quantum wires can then be readily discussed. Indeed, resorting to the 2D rotation matrix provided by competing displacements working along the Ox-axis opens the way to derive precession angles one looks for, as shown recently. Proceeding further, we have to resort reasonably to some extra conditions concerning the general selection of the equation-wavenumber via equation, where equation stands for the nanometer length scale of the quantum wire. We shall also account for rescaled wavenumbers, which opens the way to extrapolations towards imaginary and complex realizations.

1203.1426,cond-mat,"Cascade processes are responsible for many important phenomena in natural and social sciences. Simple models of irreversible dynamics on graphs, in which nodes activate depending on the state of their neighbors, have been successfully applied to describe cascades in a large variety of contexts. Over the last decades, many efforts have been devoted to understand the typical behaviour of the cascades arising from initial conditions extracted at random from some given ensemble. However, the problem of optimizing the trajectory of the system, i.e. of identifying appropriate initial conditions to maximize (or minimize) the final number of active nodes, is still considered to be practically intractable, with the only exception of models that satisfy a sort of diminishing returns property called submodularity. Submodular models can be approximately solved by means of greedy strategies, but by definition they lack cooperative characteristics which are fundamental in many real systems. Here we introduce an efficient algorithm based on statistical physics for the optimization of trajectories in cascade processes on graphs. We show that for a wide class of irreversible dynamics, even in the absence of submodularity, the spread optimization problem can be solved efficiently on large networks.

These fields create excitons in the quantum dot and surface plasmon polaritons in the graphene nanodisk which interact via the dipole-dipole interaction. Here the nonlinear photonic crystal acts as a tunable photonic reservoir for the quantum dot, and is used to control the energy transfer. We have found that the spectrum of power absorption in the quantum dot has two peaks due to the creation of two dressed excitons in the presence of the dipole-dipole interaction. The energy transfer rate spectrum of the graphene nanodisk also has two peaks due to the absorption of these two dressed excitons. Additionally, energy transfer between the quantum dot and the graphene nanodisk can be switched on and off by applying a pump laser to the photonic crystal or by adjusting the strength of the dipole-dipole interaction.

This wrinkle-to-fold transition is a manifestation of a localized buckling. The symmetric and antisymmetric shapes of the fold have recently been described by Diamant and Witten (2011), who found two exact solutions of the nonlinear equilibrium equations. In this Note, we show that these solutions can be generalized to a continuous family of solutions, which yields non symmetric shapes of the fold.

After a short overview of existing lexical ontologies, we briefly introduce the semantic web formalisms we use. We then present the three layered architecture of our approach: i) the interlingual lexical meta-ontology (ILexiMOn); ii) the ILexicOn where ILUcs are formally defined; iii) the data layer.

An edge set M is an efficient edge dominating (e.e.d.) set for G if it is an efficient dominating set in the line graph L(G) of G. The ED problem (EED problem, respectively) asks for the existence of an e.d. set (e.e.d. set, respectively) in the given graph.   We give a unified framework for investigating the complexity of these problems on various classes of graphs. In particular, we solve some open problems and give linear time algorithms for ED and EED on dually chordal graphs.

1205.1975,cs,"In infrastructure-less highly dynamic networks, computing and performing even basic tasks (such as routing and broadcasting) is a very challenging activity due to the fact that connectivity does not necessarily hold, and the network may actually be disconnected at every time instant. Clearly the task of designing protocols for these networks is less difficult if the environment allows waiting (i.e., it provides the nodes with store-carry-forward-like mechanisms such as local buffering) than if waiting is not feasible. No quantitative corroborations of this fact exist (e.g., no answer to the question: how much easier?). In this paper, we consider these qualitative questions about dynamic networks, modeled as time-varying (or evolving) graphs, where edges exist only at some times.   We examine the difficulty of the environment in terms of the expressivity of the corresponding time-varying graph; that is in terms of the language generated by the feasible journeys in the graph. We prove that the set of languages equation when no waiting is allowed contains all computable languages. On the other end, using algebraic properties of quasi-orders, we prove that equation is just the family of regular languages. In other words, we prove that, when waiting is no longer forbidden, the power of the accepting automaton (difficulty of the environment) drops drastically from being as powerful as a Turing machine, to becoming that of a Finite-State machine. This (perhaps surprisingly large) gap is a measure of the computational power of waiting.   We also study bounded waiting; that is when waiting is allowed at a node only for at most equation time units. We prove the negative result that equation; that is, the expressivity decreases only if the waiting is finite but unpredictable (i.e., under the control of the protocol designer and not of the environment).",12,[],7

In secure network coding, we aim to find a network code which can protect the message against the wiretapper whose power is constrained. Cai and Yeung \citecai2002secure studied the model in which the wiretapper can access any one but not more than one set of channels, called a wiretap set, out of a collection equation of all possible wiretap sets. In order to protect the message, the message needs to be mixed with a random key equation. They proved tight fundamental performance bounds when equation consists of all subsets of equation of a fixed size equation. However, beyond this special case, obtaining such bounds is much more difficult. In this paper, we investigate the problem when equation consists of arbitrary subsets of equation and obtain the following results: 1) an upper bound on equation; 2) a lower bound on equation in terms of equation.

1210.5888,cs,"TranSteg (Trancoding Steganography) is a fairly new IP telephony steganographic method that functions by compressing overt (voice) data to make space for the steganogram by means of transcoding. It offers high steganographic bandwidth, retains good voice quality and is generally harder to detect than other existing VoIP steganographic methods. In TranSteg, after the steganogram reaches the receiver, the hidden information is extracted and the speech data is practically restored to what was originally sent. This is a huge advantage compared with other existing VoIP steganographic methods, where the hidden data can be extracted and removed but the original data cannot be restored because it was previously erased due to a hidden data insertion process. In this paper we address the issue of steganalysis of TranSteg. Various TranSteg scenarios and possibilities of warden(s) localization are analyzed with regards to the TranSteg detection. A steganalysis method based on MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) parameters and GMMs (Gaussian Mixture Models) was developed and tested for various overt/covert codec pairs in a single warden scenario with double transcoding.

However, some data might be sensitive that the data owner does not want to move to the cloud unless the data confidentiality and query privacy are guaranteed. On the other hand, a secured query service should still provide efficient query processing and significantly reduce the in-house workload to fully realize the benefits of cloud computing. We propose the RASP data perturbation method to provide secure and efficient range query and kNN query services for protected data in the cloud. The RASP data perturbation method combines order preserving encryption, dimensionality expansion, random noise injection, and random projection, to provide strong resilience to attacks on the perturbed data and queries. It also preserves multidimensional ranges, which allows existing indexing techniques to be applied to speedup range query processing. The kNN-R algorithm is designed to work with the RASP range query algorithm to process the kNN queries.

The same is true if none of the receivers possess CSIR. This paper shows that an entirely new scenario emerges when receivers have unequal CSIR. In particular, orthogonal transmission is no longer DoF-optimal when one receiver has CSIR and the other does not. A multiplicative superposition is proposed for this scenario and shown to attain the optimal degrees of freedom under a wide set of antenna configurations and coherence lengths. Two signaling schemes are constructed based on the multiplicative superposition. In the first method, the messages of the two receivers are carried in the row and column spaces of a matrix, respectively. This method works better than orthogonal transmission while reception at each receiver is still interference free. The second method uses coherent signaling for the receiver with CSIR, and Grassmannian signaling for the receiver without CSIR. This second method requires interference cancellation at the receiver with CSIR, but achieves higher DoF than the first method.",12,['math'],7

Exposing to a (potentially untrusted) LBS the client's position and her destination may reveal personal information, such as social habits, health condition, shopping preferences, lifestyle choices, etc. The only existing method for privacy-preserving shortest path computation follows the obfuscation paradigm; it prevents the LBS from inferring the source and destination of the query with a probability higher than a threshold. This implies, however, that the LBS still deduces some information (albeit not exact) about the client's location and her destination.

In addition, the 3D-DCT can generate a compact energy spectrum whose high-frequency coefficients are sparse if the appearance samples are similar. By discarding these high-frequency coefficients, we simultaneously obtain a compact 3D-DCT based object representation and a signal reconstruction-based similarity measure (reflecting the information loss from signal reconstruction). To efficiently update the object representation, we propose an incremental 3D-DCT algorithm, which decomposes the 3D-DCT into successive operations of the 2D discrete cosine transform (2D-DCT) and 1D discrete cosine transform (1D-DCT) on the input video data.",12,[],7

This motivates us to develop nonuniform codes whose codewords can tolerate different numbers of asymmetric errors depending on their Hamming weights. The idea in a nonuniform codes' construction is to augment the redundancy in a content-dependent way and guarantee the worst case reliability while maximizing the code size. In this paper, we first study nonuniform codes for Z-channels, namely, they only suffer one type of errors, say 1 to 0.

1204.2516,cs,Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are widely used to generate random Numbers. In this paper we propose a new architecture in which an Arbiter Based PUF has been employed as a nonlinear function in Nonlinear Feedback Shift Register (NFSR) to generate true random numbers. The rate of producing the output bit streams is 10 million bits per second. The proposed RNG is able to pass all NIST tests and the entropy of the output stream is 7.999837 bits per byte. The proposed circuit has very low resource usage of 193 Slices that makes it suitable for lightweight applications.,12,[],7
1207.5206,cs,"This paper studies the achievable rates of Gaussian interference channels with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), when improper or circularly asymmetric complex Gaussian signaling is applied. For the Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output interference channel (MIMO-IC) with the interference treated as Gaussian noise, we show that the user's achievable rate can be expressed as a summation of the rate achievable by the conventional proper or circularly symmetric complex Gaussian signaling in terms of the users' transmit covariance matrices, and an additional term, which is a function of both the users' transmit covariance and pseudo-covariance matrices. The additional degrees of freedom in the pseudo-covariance matrix, which is conventionally set to be zero for the case of proper Gaussian signaling, provide an opportunity to further improve the achievable rates of Gaussian MIMO-ICs by employing improper Gaussian signaling. To this end, this paper proposes widely linear precoding, which efficiently maps proper information-bearing signals to improper transmitted signals at each transmitter for any given pair of transmit covariance and pseudo-covariance matrices. In particular, for the case of two-user Gaussian single-input single-output interference channel (SISO-IC), we propose a joint covariance and pseudo-covariance optimization algorithm with improper Gaussian signaling to achieve the Pareto-optimal rates. By utilizing the separable structure of the achievable rate expression, an alternative algorithm with separate covariance and pseudo-covariance optimization is also proposed, which guarantees the rate improvement over conventional proper Gaussian signaling.",12,['math'],7

Many things can be inferred from this part of analysis such as who is more interested in book reading than others and why? Which books are most popular and which users are most active and why? The task requires the use of certain social network analysis measures (e.g. degree centrality). What does it mean when two users like the same book? Is it the same when other two users have one thousand books in common? Who is more likely to be a friend of whom and why? Are there specific people in the community who are more qualified to establish large circles of social relations? These questions (and of course others) were answered through the other part of the analysis, which will take us to probe the potential social relations between users in this community.

1211.6512,cs,"Recent research has focused on the monitoring of global-scale online data for improved detection of epidemics, mood patterns, movements in the stock market, political revolutions, box-office revenues, consumer behaviour and many other important phenomena. However, privacy considerations and the sheer scale of data available online are quickly making global monitoring infeasible, and existing methods do not take full advantage of local network structure to identify key nodes for monitoring. Here, we develop a model of the contagious spread of information in a global-scale, publicly-articulated social network and show that a simple method can yield not just early detection, but advance warning of contagious outbreaks. In this method, we randomly choose a small fraction of nodes in the network and then we randomly choose a ""friend"" of each node to include in a group for local monitoring. Using six months of data from most of the full Twittersphere, we show that this friend group is more central in the network and it helps us to detect viral outbreaks of the use of novel hashtags about 7 days earlier than we could with an equal-sized randomly chosen group. Moreover, the method actually works better than expected due to network structure alone because highly central actors are both more active and exhibit increased diversity in the information they transmit to others. These results suggest that local monitoring is not just more efficient, it is more effective, and it is possible that other contagious processes in global-scale networks may be similarly monitored.",12,['physics'],7
1202.2880,cs,"Recall, the proportion of relevant documents retrieved, is an important measure of effectiveness in information retrieval, particularly in the legal, patent, and medical domains. Where document sets are too large for exhaustive relevance assessment, recall can be estimated by assessing a random sample of documents; but an indication of the reliability of this estimate is also required. In this article, we examine several methods for estimating two-tailed recall confidence intervals. We find that the normal approximation in current use provides poor coverage in many circumstances, even when adjusted to correct its inappropriate symmetry. Analytic and Bayesian methods based on the ratio of binomials are generally more accurate, but are inaccurate on small populations. The method we recommend derives beta-binomial posteriors on retrieved and unretrieved yield, with fixed hyperparameters, and a Monte Carlo estimate of the posterior distribution of recall. We demonstrate that this method gives mean coverage at or near the nominal level, across several scenarios, while being balanced and stable.

1212.1884,cs,"We present the first general bounds on the mixing time of the Markov chain associated to the logit dynamics for wide classes of strategic games. The logit dynamics with inverse noise beta describes the behavior of a complex system whose individual components act selfishly and keep responding according to some partial (""noisy"") knowledge of the system, where the capacity of the agent to know the system and compute her best move is measured by the inverse of the parameter beta.   In particular, we prove nearly tight bounds for potential games and games with dominant strategies. Our results show that, for potential games, the mixing time is upper and lower bounded by an exponential in the inverse of the noise and in the maximum potential difference. Instead, for games with dominant strategies, the mixing time cannot grow arbitrarily with the inverse of the noise.   Finally, we refine our analysis for a subclass of potential games called graphical coordination games, a class of games that have been previously studied in Physics and, more recently, in Computer Science in the context of diffusion of new technologies. We give evidence that the mixing time of the logit dynamics for these games strongly depends on the structure of the underlying graph. We prove that the mixing time of the logit dynamics for these games can be upper bounded by a function that is exponential in the cutwidth of the underlying graph and in the inverse of noise. Moreover, we consider two specific and popular network topologies, the clique and the ring. For games played on a clique we prove an almost matching lower bound on the mixing time of the logit dynamics that is exponential in the inverse of the noise and in the maximum potential difference, while for games played on a ring we prove that the time of convergence of the logit dynamics to its stationary distribution is significantly shorter.",12,[],7

This improves the previously best trade-off of equation, due to Feige (1995). Our algorithm consists in deploying several short Metropolis-type walks, starting from landmark nodes distributed using the scheme of Broder et al. (1994) on a modified input graph. In particular, we obtain an algorithm running in time equation which is, in general, more space-efficient than both BFS and DFS.

We exploit a general fluid queue dynamics using a continuous time dynamic equation. Using the sample-path approach and renewal theory, we decompose the average delay in terms of multiple unfinished works along a sample path, and derive an upper bound on the average delay under the DBP power control, which is asymptotically accurate at small delay regime. We show that despite imperfect CSIT quality and non-ideal circuit power, the average power (P) of the DBP policy scales with delay (D) as P = O(Dexp(1/D)) at small delay regime.

One distinct feature is that vehicles are highly mobile, with speed up to 30 m/s, though their mobility patterns are more predictable than those of nodes in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANET) due to the constraints imposed by road, speed limits, and commuting habits. Therefore, these networks require specific solutions and identify a novel research area, i.e., Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET). In this paper, we focus on a particular VSN architecture, where the ad hoc network is operated by a telecommunication/service provider to combine non-valuable individual sensed data and extract from them effective feedbacks about the situation of the road in a geographical area. In operated VSNs, providers tend to reduce the traffic load on their network, using the free-frequency communication medium (IEEE 802.11p, for example). To do so, we propose TCDGP (Tree Clustered Data Gathering Protocol), a cross layer protocol based on hierarchical and geographical data collection, aggregation and dissemination mechanisms.

1210.2459,cs,"For some time the discrete strategy improvement algorithm due to Jurdzinski and Voge had been considered as a candidate for solving parity games in polynomial time. However, it has recently been proved by Oliver Friedmann that the strategy improvement algorithm requires super-polynomially many iteration steps, for all popular local improvements rules, including switch-all (also with Fearnley's snare memorisation), switch-best, random-facet, random-edge, switch-half, least-recently-considered, and Zadeh's Pivoting rule.   We analyse the examples provided by Friedmann in terms of complexity measures for directed graphs such as treewidth, DAG-width, Kelly-width, entanglement, directed pathwidth, and cliquewidth. It is known that for every class of parity games on which one of these parameters is bounded, the winning regions can be efficiently computed. It turns out that with respect to almost all of these measures, the complexity of Friedmann's counterexamples is bounded, and indeed in most cases by very small numbers. This analysis strengthens in some sense Friedmann's results and shows that the discrete strategy improvement algorithm is even more limited than one might have thought.

The doxastic accessibility relates two possible worlds whenever the application of the composition of bias with visibility to the first world is equal to the application of visibility to the second world. The epistemic accessibility is the transitive closure of the union of our doxastic accessibility and its converse.

1206.1903,cs,"Among the many challenges of integrating renewable energy sources into the existing power grid, is the challenge of integrating renewable energy generators into the power systems economy. Electricity markets currently are run in a way that participating generators must supply contracted amounts. And yet, renewable energy generators such as wind power generators cannot supply contracted amounts with certainty. Thus, alternative market architectures must be considered where there are aggregator entities who participate in the electricity market by buying power from the renewable energy generators, and assuming risk of any shortfall from contracted amounts. In this paper, we propose auction mechanisms that can be used by the aggregators for procuring stochastic resources, such as wind power. The nature of stochastic resources is different from classical resources in that such a resource is only available stochastically. The distribution of the generation is private information, and the system objective is to truthfully elicit such information. We introduce a variant of the VCG mechanism for this problem.

1203.4627,cs,"How does one allocate a collection of resources to a set of strategic agents in a fair and efficient manner without using money? For in many scenarios it is not feasible to use money to compensate agents for otherwise unsatisfactory outcomes. This paper studies this question, looking at both fairness and efficiency measures.   We employ the proportionally fair solution, which is a well-known fairness concept for money-free settings. But although finding a proportionally fair solution is computationally tractable, it cannot be implemented in a truthful fashion. Consequently, we seek approximate solutions. We give several truthful mechanisms which achieve proportional fairness in an approximate sense. We use a strong notion of approximation, requiring the mechanism to give each agent a good approximation of its proportionally fair utility. In particular, one of our mechanisms provides a better and better approximation factor as the minimum demand for every good increases. A motivating example is provided by the massive privatization auction in the Czech republic in the early 90s.   With regard to efficiency, prior work has shown a lower bound of 0.5 on the approximation factor of any swap-dictatorial mechanism approximating a social welfare measure even for the two agents and multiple goods case.

Mirror descent can be viewed as a proximal algorithm where the distance generating function used is a Bregman divergence. A new class of proximal-gradient based temporal-difference (TD) methods are presented based on different Bregman divergences, which are more powerful than regular TD learning. Examples of Bregman divergences that are studied include p-norm functions, and Mahalanobis distance based on the covariance of sample gradients.

1211.2660,gr-qc,"We study a generalization of the ""shear-free part"" of the Goldberg-Sachs theorem for Einstein spacetimes admitting a non-twisting multiple Weyl Aligned Null Direction (WAND) l in n>=6 spacetime dimensions. The form of the corresponding optical matrix equation is restricted by the algebraically special property in terms of the degeneracy of its eigenvalues. In particular, there necessarily exists at least one multiple eigenvalue and further constraints arise in various special cases. For example, when equation is non-degenerate and the Weyl components equation are non-zero, all eigenvalues of equation coincide and such spacetimes thus correspond to the Robinson-Trautman (RT) class. On the other hand, in certain degenerate cases all non-zero eigenvalues can be distinct. We also present explicit examples of Einstein spacetimes admitting some of the permitted forms of equation, including examples violating the ""optical constraint"". The obtained restrictions on equation are, however, in general not sufficient for l to be a multiple WAND, as demonstrated by a few ""counterexamples"". We also discuss the geometrical meaning of these restrictions in terms of integrability properties of certain null distributions. Finally, we specialize our analysis to the six-dimensional case, where all the permitted forms of equation are given in terms of just two parameters.

The connection-generating metric naturally allows also an antisymmetric component. This sets torsion propagating! It is also shown here that while in the most straightforward generalization of the Einstein-Hilbert action the nonmetric degrees of freedom become ghosts, there exist very simple actions which give rise to viable theories at the linearised level when subjected to the bimetric variational principle. However, the non linear interactions might bring unpleasant features like the Boulware-Deser ghost.

1210.0750,gr-qc,"While a natural ultraviolet cutoff, presumably at the Planck length, is widely assumed to exist in nature, it has proven difficult to implement a minimum length scale covariantly. A key reason is that the presence of a fixed minimum length would seem to contradict the ability of Lorentz transformations to contract lengths. In this paper, we implement a fully covariant Planck scale cutoff by cutting off the spectrum of the d'Alembertian. In this scenario, consistent with Lorentz contractions, wavelengths that are arbitrarily smaller than the Planck length continue to exist. However, the dynamics of modes of wavelengths that are significantly smaller than the Planck length possess a very small bandwidth. This has the effect of freezing the dynamics of such modes. While both, wavelengths and bandwidths, are frame dependent, Lorentz contraction and time dilation conspire to make the freezing of modes of transplanckian wavelengths covariant. In particular, we show that this ultraviolet cutoff can be implemented covariantly also in curved spacetimes. We focus on Friedmann Robertson Walker (FRW) spacetimes and their much-discussed transplanckian question: The physical wavelength of each comoving mode was smaller than the Planck scale at sufficiently early times. What was the mode's dynamics then? Here, we show that in the presence of the covariant UV cutoff, the dynamical bandwidth of a comoving mode is essentially zero up until its physical wavelength starts exceeding the Planck length. In particular, we show that under general assumptions, the number of dynamical degrees of freedom of each comoving mode all the way up to some arbitrary finite time is actually finite.

First, it is pointed out the existence of exact asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric black holes when a self interacting, minimally coupled scalar field is the source of the energy momentum of the Einstein equations in four dimensions. The scalar field potential is the recently found to be compatible with the hairy generalization of the Plebanski-Demianski solution of general relativity. This paper describes the spherically symmetric solutions that smoothly connect the Schwarzschild black hole with its hairy counterpart. The geometry and scalar field are everywhere regular except at the usual Schwarzschild like singularity inside the black hole. The scalar field energy momentum tensor satisfies the null energy condition in the static region of the spacetime. The first law holds when the parameters of the scalar field potential are fixed under thermodynamical variation. Secondly, it is shown that an extra, dimensionless parameter, present in the hairy solution, allows to modify the gravitational field of a spherically symmetric black hole in a remarkable way. When the dimensionless parameter is increased, the scalar field generates a flat gravitational potential, that however asymptotically matches the Schwarzschild gravitational field. Finally, it is shown that a positive cosmological constant can render the scalar field potential convex if the parameters are within a specific rank.",12,"['astro-ph', 'hep-th']",13
1201.2218,gr-qc,"We analyze the general relativistic oscillations of thin accretion disks around compact astrophysical objects interacting with the surrounding medium through non-gravitational forces. The interaction with the external medium (a thermal bath) is modeled via a friction force, and a random force, respectively. The general equations describing the stochastically perturbed disks are derived by considering the perturbations of trajectories of the test particles in equatorial orbits, assumed to move along the geodesic lines. By taking into account the presence of a viscous dissipation and of a stochastic force we show that the dynamics of the stochastically perturbed disks can be formulated in terms of a general relativistic Langevin equation. The stochastic energy transport equation is also obtained. The vertical oscillations of the disks in the Schwarzschild and Kerr geometries are considered in detail, and they are analyzed by numerically integrating the corresponding Langevin equations.

However, spontaneous excitation can take place both in the Unruh and the Hartle-Hawking vacua as if there were thermal radiation from the black hole. Distinctive features in contrast to the scalar field case are the existence of a term proportional to the proper acceleration squared in the rate of change of the mean atomic energy in the Unruh and the Hartle-Hawking vacuums and the structural similarity in the spontaneous excitation rate between the static atoms outside a black hole and uniformly accelerated ones in a flat space with a reflecting boundary, which is particularly dramatic at the event horizon where a complete equivalence exists.",12,"['physics', 'quant-ph']",13

1207.0001,gr-qc,"This paper is to introduce a new software called CBwaves which provides a fast and accurate computational tool to determine the gravitational waveforms yielded by generic spinning binaries of neutron stars and/or black holes on eccentric orbits. This is done within the post-Newtonian (PN) framework by integrating the equations of motion and the spin precession equations while the radiation field is determined by a simultaneous evaluation of the analytic waveforms. In applying CBwaves various physically interesting scenarios have been investigated. In particular, we have studied the appropriateness of the adiabatic approximation, and justified that the energy balance relation is indeed insensitive to the specific form of the applied radiation reaction term. By studying eccentric binary systems it is demonstrated that circular template banks are very ineffective in identifying binaries even if they possess tiny residual orbital eccentricity. In addition, by investigating the validity of the energy balance relation we show that, on contrary to the general expectations, the post-Newtonian approximation should not be applied once the post-Newtonian parameter gets beyond the critical value equation. Finally, by studying the early phase of the gravitational waves emitted by strongly eccentric binary systems---which could be formed e.g. in various many-body interactions in the galactic halo---we have found that they possess very specific characteristics which may be used to identify these type of binary systems.",12,[],13

Our method combines the Hadamard form for equation (this form is only valid within a normal neighbourhood of equation) together with Kirchhoff's integral representation for the field in order to calculate equation outside the maximal normal neighbourhood of equation. As an example, we apply this method to the case of a scalar field on a black hole toy-model spacetime, the Pleba\'nski-Hacyan spacetime, equation. The method allows us to determine in an exact manner that the singularity structure of the `direct' term in the Hadamard form for equation changes from a form equation to `equation' after the null geodesic joining equation and equation has crossed a caustic point, where equation is the world function. Furthermore, there is a change of form from a equation to a `equation' in the `tail' term, which has not been explicitly noted before in the literature. We complement the results from the Kirchhoff integral method with an analysis for large-equation of the Green function modes. This analysis allows us to determine the singularity structure after null geodesics have crossed an arbitrary number of caustics, although it raises a causality issue which the Kirchhoff integral method resolves. Because of the similarity in the caustic structure of the spacetimes, we expect our main results for wave propagation to also be valid on Schwarzschild spacetime.",12,[],13

The resulting theory also predicts new tests which can be experimentally checked within just a few years. The two new equations are : A) a creation equation to give stimulated emission for any surface filled with gravitons, pulling energy from a background, and B) the association of an outgoing soliton wave of gravitons, a ""shell front"" with a large Lorentz factor derived from the uncertainties in both space and time. These new equations are combined with the common notions of an all-pervasive background of gravitons at the Planck limit, the ""Planck sea""; the identification of the thermodynamic limit with the emission of gravitons in a ""shell front"", i.e. what is usually called the entropy of black holes is identified with the outgoing gravitons; the concept of black holes as a membrane full of gravitons at a large Lorentz factor, the ""Planck shell""; the emission of gravitons created in a ""horizon shell"" during inflation. These equations result in stimulated emission of gravitons by the interaction with the background, the ""Planck sea"", to describe dark energy, black holes, the inflationary period of the universe, and the arrow of time. These proposals lead to gravitational waves constituting dark energy. These waves should be detectable within a few years with pulsar timing arrays.

On the other hand, it is expected that quantum or classical modifications of general relativity may correct the pathological singular behavior of classical black hole solutions. Despite the fact that we do not have at hand a complete theory of quantum gravity, regular black hole solutions can be constructed by coupling gravity to an external form of matter, sometimes modeled by one form or another of nonlinear electrodynamics. It is therefore relevant to compute quasinormal frequencies for these regular solutions and see how differently, from the ordinary ones, regular black holes ring.

1209.2895,gr-qc,"A new class of modified theories of gravity, consisting of the superposition of the metric Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian with an equation term constructed \`a la Palatini was proposed recently. The dynamically equivalent scalar-tensor representation of the model was also formulated, and it was shown that even if the scalar field is very light, the theory passes the Solar System observational constraints. Therefore the model predicts the existence of a long-range scalar field, modifying the cosmological and galactic dynamics. An explicit model that passes the local tests and leads to cosmic acceleration was also obtained. In the present work, it is shown that the theory can be also formulated in terms of the quantity equation, where T and R are the traces of the stress-energy and Ricci tensors, respectively. The variable X represents the deviation with respect to the field equation trace of general relativity. The cosmological applications of this hybrid metric-Palatini gravitational theory are also explored, and cosmological solutions coming from the scalar-tensor representation of f(X)-gravity are presented. Criteria to obtain cosmic acceleration are discussed and the field equations are analyzed as a dynamical system. Several classes of dynamical cosmological solutions, depending on the functional form of the effective scalar field potential, describing both accelerating and decelerating Universes are explicitly obtained.

The observable is linearized to be collinear safe and is measured in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction using primary charged tracks with equation GeV/c in equation. The mean sphericity as a function of the charged particle multiplicity at mid-rapidity (equation) is reported for events with different equation scales (""soft"" and ""hard"") defined by the transverse momentum of the leading particle. In addition, the mean charged particle transverse momentum versus multiplicity is presented for the different event classes, and the sphericity distributions in bins of multiplicity are presented. The data are compared with calculations of standard Monte Carlo event generators. The transverse sphericity is found to grow with multiplicity at all collision energies, with a steeper rise at low equation, whereas the event generators show the opposite tendency. The combined study of the sphericity and the mean equation with multiplicity indicates that most of the tested event generators produce events with higher multiplicity by generating more back-to-back jets resulting in decreased sphericity (and isotropy).

The quasi-parallel photon-photon collision system (QPS) can provide chances to probe the resonant production of these light dark fields and the induced decay by the coherent nature of laser fields simultaneously. By focusing high-intensity lasers with different colors in the vacuum, new colors emerge as the signature of the interaction. Because four photons in the initial and final states interplay via the dark field exchange, this process is analogous to four-wave mixing in quantum optics, where the frequency sum and difference among the incident three waves generate the fourth wave with a new frequency via the nonlinear property of crystals. The interaction rate of the four-wave mixing process has the cubic dependence on the intensity of each wave. Therefore, if high-intensity laser fields are given, the sensitivity to the weakly coupling of dark fields to photons rapidly increases over the wide mass range below sub-eV. Based on the experimentally measurable photon energies and the linear polarization states, we formulate the relation between the accessible mass-coupling domains and the high-intensity laser parameters, where the effects of the finite spectrum width of pulse lasers are taken into account.

In addition, we try to explain muon anomaly aletter \equiv (g-2)/2 within the model, but the contribution induced by new particles is too small to account for the discrepancy. In WDM scenario, We show that relic abundance can be produced by thermal production with subsequent entropy dilution process.

This implies a lower limit on lepton flavor violating processes in the equation sector in a variety of frameworks, including Higgs triplet models or the concept of minimal flavor violation in the lepton sector. We illustrate this for the branching ratio of equation in the type II seesaw mechanism, in which a Higgs triplet is responsible for neutrino mass and also mediates lepton flavor violation. We also discuss processes like equation and equation conversion in nuclei. Since these processes have sensitivity on the individual entries of equation, their rates can still be vanishingly small.",12,['hep-ex'],2

We argue that LHC data will probe all the new content of this model: heavy neutrinos, an extra gauge boson emerging from spontaneous breaking of the additional gauge group at the TeV scale, onset by a new heavier Higgs boson, also visible at the CERN proton-proton collider. An even more exciting version of this model is the one exploiting Supersymmetry: firstly, it incorporates all its well known benefits; secondly, it alleviates the flaws of its more minimal realisations.

At the ILC/CLIC it will be possible to capture a significant fraction of the produced charged sleptons and observe their decays. These decays potentially reveal the nature of the LSP and thus provide a unique possibility to measure the properties of a very weakly interacting LSP which otherwise is most likely hidden from any other observation, like direct or indirect dark matter searches.

We also show that that complementary constraints on the same class of models can be obtained with experiments testing clock universality in deep underground/underwater experiments. By considering the explicit QED model with particle-universal modification of propagation speed by a depth-dependent tensor background, we show that in general one should expect larger-than-GR shifts of the clock frequencies and clock non-universality.

However, it requires a particular hierarchy of Majorana masses and Yukawa couplings without an obvious origin. We show that the hierarchical parameters of the nuNMSM can arise from symmetries broken at or near the Planck scale for two specific examples of this model: one in which phi helps stabilize the electroweak vacuum through a scalar threshold effect and one in which phi is a light inflaton. Both examples require a complex phi and have several experimental signatures that are distinct from the nuMSM.

Therefore we find that it is unlikely that clustering logs can be resummed to NLL. Clustering logarithms make the anti-kT algorithm theoretically preferred, for which they are power suppressed. They can arise in Abelian and non-Abelian terms, and we calculate the Abelian clustering logarithms at two loops for the jet mass distribution using the Cambridge/Aachen and kT algorithms, including jet radius dependence, which extends previous results.

1212.4504,hep-ph,"We consider the POWHEG generator for a H/W/Z boson plus one jet, augmented with the recently proposed MiNLO method for the choice of scales and the inclusion of Sudakov form factors. Within this framework, the generator covers all the transverse-momentum region of the H/W/Z boson, i.e. no generation cuts are needed to obtain a finite result. By construction, the generator achieves NLO accuracy for distributions involving a finite (and relatively large) transverse momentum of the boson. We examine the conditions under which also the totally inclusive distributions (e.g. the boson rapidity distribution) achieve NLO accuracy. We find that a minimal modification of the MiNLO prescription is sufficient to achieve such accuracy. We thus construct a NLO generator for H/W/Z boson plus one jet production such that it smoothly merges into a NLO single boson production in the small transverse-momentum region. We notice that, by simply reweighting the boson rapidity distribution to NNLO predictions, we achieve a NNLO accurate generator matched to a shower.

So, the difference of two models is designed only in terms of the flavor symmetry, by changing the charge assignment of righthanded neutrinos. The PMNS matrix in the first model is obtained from both mass matrices, charged leptons giving rise to non-zero equation and neutrino masses giving rise to tri-bi-maximal mixing. The physical mixing angles are expressed by a simple relation between equation and tri-bi-maximal angles to fit the recent experimental results.

For the NMSSM benchmark lines which generalize cMSSM benchmark points, the efficiencies in the most relevant 2/3 jet  missing energy search channels can drop by factors ~1/3 to ~1/7, and can reduce the present lower bounds on M1/2 by as much as ~0.9 - 0.75 in the NMSSM for large bino-singlino mass differences. The larger efficiencies in multijet or multilepton search channels are not strong enough to affect this conclusion.

We consider three possible cases, assuming in turn that the discovered Higgs boson is: i) the lightest Higgs boson of the model; ii) the next-to-lightest Higgs boson; and iii) a combination of both roughly degenerate in mass. The likelihood function for the Higgs signal uses signal rates in the letterletter\ and ZZ to 4l channels, while that for the Higgs exclusion limits assumes decay through the letterletter, letterletter, ZZ and WW- channels. In all cases considered we identify the 68% and 95% credible posterior probability regions in a Bayesian approach.

We predict a second monochromatic photon peak at 114 GeV due to XX-> gamma Z. The S is colored under a hidden sector SU(N) or QCD to help boost the XX -> gamma gamma cross section. The analogous coupling lambdah h2 S2 to the Higgs boson can naturally increase the partial width for h -> gamma gamma by an amount comparable to its standard model value, as suggested by recent measurements from CMS. Due to the hidden sector SU(N) (or QCD), S binds to its antiparticle to form S-mesons, which will be pair-produced in colliders and then decay predominantly to XX, hh, or to glueballs of the SU(N) which subsequently decay to photons.

We find that stau and stop co-annihilation mechanisms -- already highly stressed by the latest Atlas/CMS results on SUSY searches -- are nearly eliminated if indeed the light Higgs scalar has mass mh\simeq 125 GeV. Furthermore, neutralino annihilation via the A-resonance is essentially ruled out in mSUGRA so that it is exceedingly difficult to generate thermally-produced neutralino-only dark matter at the measured abundance. The remaining possibility lies in the focus-point region which now moves out to m0\sim 10-20 TeV range due to the required large trilinear soft SUSY breaking term A0. The remaining HB/FP region is more fine-tuned than before owing to the typically large top squark masses.

For the lowest metastable initial state an efficient quantum Zeno effect occurs due to thermal radiation of temperatures as low as the de Sitter temperature.

1201.1331,hep-th,"In the large N limit cold dense nuclear matter must be in a lattice phase. This applies also to holographic models of hadron physics. In a class of such models, like the generalized Sakai-Sugimoto model, baryons take the form of instantons of the effective flavor gauge theory that resides on probe flavor branes. In this paper we study the phase structure of baryonic crystals by analyzing discrete periodic configurations of such instantons. We find that instanton configurations exhibit a series of ""popcorn"" transitions upon increasing the density. Through these transitions normal (3D) lattices expand into the transverse dimension, eventually becoming a higher dimensional (4D) multi-layer lattice at large densities.   We consider 3D lattices of zero size instantons as well as 1D periodic chains of finite size instantons, which serve as toy models of the full holographic systems. In particular, for the finite-size case we determine solutions of the corresponding ADHM equations for both a straight chain and for a 2D zigzag configuration where instantons pop up into the holographic dimension. At low density the system takes the form of an ""abelian anti-ferromagnetic"" straight periodic chain. Above a critical density there is a second order phase transition into a zigzag structure. An even higher density yields a rich phase space characterized by the formation of multi-layer zigzag structures. The finite size of the lattices in the transverse dimension is a signal of an emerging Fermi sea of quarks.

Firstly, studying scalar perturbations around Minkowski space-time, we show that there exists one scalar degree of freedom and identify it in terms of the metric perturbations.

1205.6814,hep-th,"Area products for multi-horizon stationary black holes often have intriguing properties, and are often (though not always) independent of the mass of the black hole itself (depending only on various charges, angular momenta, and moduli). Such products are often formulated in terms of the areas of inner (Cauchy) horizons and outer (event) horizons, and sometimes include the effects of unphysical ""virtual"" horizons. But the conjectured mass-independence sometimes fails. Specifically, for the Schwarzschild-de Sitter [Kottler] black hole in (31) dimensions it is shown by explicit exact calculation that the product of event horizon area and cosmological horizon area is not mass independent. (Including the effect of the third ""virtual"" horizon does not improve the situation.) Similarly, in the Reissner-Nordstrom-anti-de Sitter black hole in (31) dimensions the product of inner (Cauchy) horizon area and event horizon area is calculated (perturbatively), and is shown to be not mass independent. That is, the mass-independence of the product of physical horizon areas is not generic. In spherical symmetry, whenever the quasi-local mass m(r) is a Laurent polynomial in aerial radius, r=sqrtA/4letter, there are significantly more complicated mass-independent quantities, the elementary symmetric polynomials built up from the complete set of horizon radii (physical and virtual).

This requirement can be slightly relaxed if M is a torus bundle over a Riemann surface, in which case we obtain a supercharge that squares to a complex Killing vector. We also analyze the conditions for the presence of more than one supercharge. The exceptional case occurs when M is a warped product S3 x R, where the radius of the round S3 is allowed to vary along R.

Locally, these form fields are just additive renormalizations of the cosmological constant. They have no fluctuating degrees of freedom. However, once the fields are coupled to membranes charged under them, their configurations are unstable: by a process analogous to Schwinger pair production the field space-filling flux increases. This reduces the cosmological constant, and preserves the null energy condition, since the processes that can violate it by reducing the form flux are very suppressed. The increase of the form flux implies that as time goes on the probability for further membrane nucleation \it increases, in contrast to the usual case where the field approaches its vacuum value and ceases to induce further transitions. Thus, in such models spaces with tiny positive vacuum energy are ultimately unstable, but the instability may be slow and localized.

With an initial number of flux quanta Q0 \simgeq N, this can result in N efolds of inflationary expansion while producing a scale-invariant spectrum of adiabatic density perturbations with amplitude and tilt consistent with observation.

1212.1397,math,"In this paper, we consider an efficient iterative approach to the solution of the discrete Helmholtz equation with Dirichlet, Neumann and Sommerfeld-like boundary conditions based on a compact sixth order approximation scheme and preconditioned Krylov subspace methodology. A sixth order compact scheme for the 3D Helmholtz equation with different boundary conditions is developed to reduce approximation and pollution errors, thereby softening the point-per-wavelength constraint. The resulting systems of finite-difference equations are solved by different preconditioned Krylov subspace-based methods. In the majority of test problems, the preconditioned Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) method is the superior choice, but in the case of sufficiently fine grids a simple stationary two-level algorithm proposed in this paper in combination with a lower order approximation preconditioner presents an efficient alternative to the GMRES method. In the analysis of the lower order preconditioning developed here, we introduce the term ""equation-th order preconditioned matrix"" in addition to the commonly used ""an optimal preconditioner"". The necessity of the new criterion is justified by the fact that the condition number of the preconditioned matrix equation in some of our test problems improves with the decrease of the grid step size. In a simple 1D case, we are able to prove this analytically. This new parameter could serve as a guide in the construction of new preconditioners. The lower order direct preconditioner used in our algorithms is based on a combination of the separation of variables technique and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) type methods.

1201.3904,math,"We investigate scattering, localization and dispersive time-decay properties for the one-dimensional Schrodinger equation with a rapidly oscillating and spatially localized potential, equation, where equation is periodic and mean zero with respect to equation. Such potentials model a microstructured medium. Homogenization theory fails to capture the correct low-energy (equation small) behavior of scattering quantities, e.g. the transmission coefficient, equation, as equation tends to zero. We derive an effective potential well, equation, such that equation is uniformly small on equation and small in any bounded subset of a suitable complex strip. Within such a bounded subset, the scaled transmission coefficient has a universal form, depending on a single parameter, which is computable from the effective potential. A consequence is that if equation, the scale of oscillation of the microstructure potential, is sufficiently small, then there is a pole of the transmission coefficient (and hence of the resolvent) in the upper half plane, on the imaginary axis at a distance of order equation from zero. It follows that the Schrodinger operator equation has an equation bound state with negative energy situated at a distance equation from the edge of the continuous spectrum. Finally, we use this detailed information to prove a local energy time-decay estimate of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation.",12,['math-ph'],0

We deduce a functional equation for the resolvent of the model, involving some ring generating function describing the immediate vicinity of the loops. When the ring generating function has a single pole, the model is amenable to a full solution. Physically, such situation is realized upon considering loops visiting triangles only and further weighting these loops by some local bending energy. Our model interpolates between the two previously solved cases of triangulations without bending energy and quadrangulations with rigid loops. We analyze the phase diagram of our model in details and derive in particular the location of its non-generic critical points, which are in the universality classes of the dense and dilute O(n) model coupled to 2D quantum gravity.

Using Schrodinger equation for complete orthonormal sets of -exponential type orbitals (-ETO) introduced by the author, it is shown that the origin of these polynomials is the centrally symmetric potential which contains the core attraction potential and the quantum frictional potential of the field produced by the particle itself. The quantum frictional forces are the analog of radiation damping or frictional forces suggested by Lorentz in classical electrodynamics. The new -LTP are complete without the inclusion of the continuum states of hydrogen like atoms. It is shown that the nonstandard and standard conventions of -LTP and their weight functions are the same. As an application, the sets of infinite expansion formulas in terms of -LTP and L-Generalized Laguerre polynomials (L-GLP) for atomic nuclear attraction integrals of Slater type orbitals (STO) and Coulomb-Yukawa like correlated interaction potentials (CIP) with integer and noninteger indices are obtained.

The equations are Hamiltonian, and can be reduced to a dynamical system for 5 real variables with 2 conservation laws. If the Hamiltonian, equation, is zero we reduce this dynamical system to the motion of a particle in a one-dimensional time-independent potential and prove that the system is integrable. Explicit solutions are obtained for some particular initial conditions. When explicit solution is not possible we present a novel numerical/analytical method for approximating the dynamics. Furthermore we show analytically that when H=0 the motion is generically bounded. That is to say the waves in the forced triad are bounded in amplitude for all times for any initial condition with the single exception of one special choice of initial condition for which the forcing is in phase with the nonlinear oscillation of the triad. This means that the energy in the forced triad generically remains finite for all time despite the fact that there is no dissipation in the system. We provide a detailed characterisation of the dependence of the period and maximum energy of the system on the conserved quantities and forcing intensity. When equation we reduce the problem to the motion of a particle in a one-dimensional time-periodic potential.

Subsequently, we switch the sign of the interaction to induce interatomic attraction and monitor the ensuing dynamics. Regions of the stable self-trapping and catastrophic collapse of 2D fundamental solitons are identified in the parameter plane of the OL strength and BEC norm. The increase of the OL strength expands the persistence domain for the solitons to larger norms. For single-charged solitary vortices, in addition to the survival and collapse regimes, an intermediate one is identified, where the vortex resists the collapse but loses its structure, transforming into a fundamental soliton.

1212.1216,nlin,"Time synchronization is important for a variety of applications in wireless sensor networks including scheduling communication resources, coordinating sensor wake/sleep cycles, and aligning signals for distributed transmission/reception. This paper describes a non-hierarchical approach to time synchronization in wireless sensor networks that has low overhead and can be implemented at the physical and/or MAC layers. Unlike most of the prior approaches, the approach described in this paper allows all nodes to use exactly the same distributed algorithm and does not require local averaging of measurements from other nodes. Analytical results show that the non-hierarchical approach can provide monotonic expected convergence of both drifts and offsets under broad conditions on the network topology and local clock update stepsize. Numerical results are also presented verifying the analysis under two particular network topologies.",12,['cs'],9

The breathers are found to coexist with solitons and be prevalent in the products of the soliton collisions.

We aim to be robust to network latencies, and to allow robots to join or leave the group at any time (for example a fallen robot should be able to stand up to rejoin the choreography).

1204.1934,nlin,"This work introduces the phenomenon of Collective Almost Synchronization (CAS), which describes a universal way of how patterns can appear in complex networks even for small coupling strengths. The CAS phenomenon appears due to the existence of an approximately constant local mean field and is characterized by having nodes with trajectories evolving around periodic stable orbits. Common notion based on statistical knowledge would lead one to interpret the appearance of a local constant mean field as a consequence of the fact that the behavior of each node is not correlated to the behaviors of the others. Contrary to this common notion, we show that various well known weaker forms of synchronization (almost, time-lag, phase synchronization, and generalized synchronization) appear as a result of the onset of an almost constant local mean field. If the memory is formed in a brain by minimising the coupling strength among neurons and maximising the number of possible patterns, then the CAS phenomenon is a plausible explanation for it.",12,[],9
1206.3338,nlin,"In this article we study the dynamics of coupled oscillators. We use mechanical metronomes that are placed over a rigid base. The base moves by a motor in a one-dimensional direction and the movements of the base follow some functions of the phases of the metronomes (in other words, it is controlled to move according to a provided function). Because of the motor and the feedback, the phases of the metronomes affect the movements of the base while on the other hand, when the base moves, it affects the phases of the metronomes in return.   For a simple function for the base movement (such as equation in which equation is the velocity of the base, equation is a multiplier, equation is a proportion and equation and equation are phases of the metronomes), we show the effects on the dynamics of the oscillators. Then we study how this function changes in time when its parameters adapt by a feedback. By numerical simulations and experimental tests, we show that the dynamic of the set of oscillators and the base tends to evolve towards a certain region. This region is close to a transition in dynamics of the oscillators; where more frequencies start to appear in the frequency spectra of the phases of the metronomes.",12,[],9

1201.4591,nlin,"We examine the properties of a recently proposed model for antigenic variation in malaria which incorporates multiple epitopes and both long-lasting and transient immune responses. We show that in the case of a vanishing decay rate for the long-lasting immune response, the system exhibits the so-called ""bifurcations without parameters"" due to the existence of a hypersurface of equilibria in the phase space. When the decay rate of the long-lasting immune response is different from zero, the hypersurface of equilibria degenerates, and a multitude of other steady states are born, many of which are related by a permutation symmetry of the system. The robustness of the fully symmetric state of the system was investigated by means of numerical computation of transverse Lyapunov exponents. The results of this exercise indicate that for a vanishing decay of long-lasting immune response, the fully symmetric state is not robust in the substantial part of the parameter space, and instead all variants develop their own temporal dynamics contributing to the overall time evolution. At the same time, if the decay rate of the long-lasting immune response is increased, the fully symmetric state can become robust provided the growth rate of the long-lasting immune response is rapid.",12,"['math', 'q-bio']",9

We also demonstrate conditions under which, as the flock size increases, the interior density in our equilibria tends to an approximately uniform value. Motivated by observations of starling flocks that are relatively thin in a direction transverse to the direction of flight, we investigate the stability of infinite, planar-sheet flock equilibria. We find that long- wavelength perturbations along the sheet are unstable for the class of models that we investigate. This has the conjectured consequence that sheet-like flocks of arbitrarily large transverse extent relative to their thickness do not occur. However, we also show that our model admits approximately sheet-like, 'pancake-shaped', three-dimensional ellipsoidal equilibria with definite aspect ratios (transverse length- scale to flock thickness) determined by anisotropic perceptual/response characteristics of the flocking individuals, and we argue that these pancake-like equilibria are stable to the previously mentioned sheet instability.",12,[],9

Using a combination of analytical techniques, based on differential and algebraic inequalities and selected numerical illustrations, we first derive conditions for collapse of an initially excited single-site unit, for both the Hamiltonian and the linearly damped versions of the system and showcase different potential fates of the single-site excitation, such as the possibility to be ""pulled back"" from outside the well or to ""drive over"" the barrier some of its neighbors. Next, we study the evolution of a uniform (small) segment of the chain and, in turn, consider the conditions that support its escape and collapse of the chain. Finally, our path from one to the few and finally to the many excited sites is completed by a modulational stability analysis and the exploration of its connection to the escape process for plane wave initial data. This reveals the existence of three distinct regimes, namely modulational stability, modulational instability without escape and, finally, modulational instability accompanied by escape. These are corroborated by direct numerical simulations. In each of the above cases, the variations of the relevant model parameters enable a consideration of the interplay of discreteness and nonlinearity within the observed phenomenology.",12,[],9

Near the bifurcations of these patterns, noise may induce a transition from one type of pattern to another. We study the onset of these noise-induced swarm re-organizations by numerically simulating the system over a range of noise intensities and for various distributions of the delays.

In such systems, users arrive at a station, take a bike and use it for a while, then return it to another station of their choice. Each station has a finite capacity: it cannot host more bikes than its capacity. We propose a stochastic model of an homogeneous bike-sharing system and study the effect of users random choices on the number of problematic stations, i.e., stations that, at a given time, have no bikes available or no available spots for bikes to be returned to. We quantify the influence of the station capacities, and we compute the fleet size that is optimal in terms of minimizing the proportion of problematic stations. Even in a homogeneous city, the system exhibits a poor performance: the minimal proportion of problematic stations is of the order of (but not lower than) the inverse of the capacity. We show that simple incentives, such as suggesting users to return to the least loaded station among two stations, improve the situation by an exponential factor. We also compute the rate at which bikes have to be redistributed by trucks to insure a given quality of service. This rate is of the order of the inverse of the station capacity. For all cases considered, the fleet size that corresponds to the best performance is half of the total number of spots plus a few more, the value of the few more can be computed in closed-form as a function of the system parameters.

Other charming examples of synchronization can also be found in a wide range of phenomena such as, e.g., neurons firing, lasers cascades, chemical reactions, and opinion formation. However, in many situations the formation of a coherent state is not pleasant and should be mitigated. For example, the onset of synchronization can be the root of epileptic seizures, traffic congestion in communication networks, and the collapse of constructions. Here we propose the use of contrarians to suppress undesired synchronization. We perform a comparative study of different strategies, either requiring local or total knowledge of the system, and show that the most efficient one solely requires local information. Our results also reveal that, even when the distribution of neighboring interactions is narrow, significant improvement in mitigation is observed when contrarians sit at the highly connected elements.

At weak interactions the bouncing maps show jumps between quasi-regular orbits. In the strong-interaction limit we find an analytic expression for the bouncing map. Its validity in the general case is assessed by comparison with our numerical data.

By using a simple model to follow the behavioral tendencies of real data, we show that our model can exhibit emergent self-organizing dynamics such as flocking, pattern formation, and counter-rotating vortices.

This problem is most commonly studied using partial differential equations to model a reaction-diffusion system of the type introduced by Turing. We report here on a much simpler and more robust model of spatial pattern formation, which is formulated as a novel type of coupled map lattice. In our model, the local site dynamics are coupled through a competitive, rather than diffusive, interaction. Depending only on the strength of the interaction, this competitive coupling results in spontaneous symmetry breaking of a homogeneous initial configuration and the formation of stable spatial patterns. This mechanism is very robust and produces stable pattern formation for a wide variety of spatial geometries, even when the local site dynamics is trivial.",12,[],9

We show this to be a direct consequence of the strong coupling of the heavy quarks to the QGP and their hadronization via coalescence with strange quarks. We furthermore introduce the effects of diffusion in the hadronic phase and suggest that an increase of the equation-meson elliptic flow compared to the equation can disentangle the transport properties of hadronic and QGP liquids.",12,"['hep-ph', 'nucl-ex']",11

In a second step, we optimize a new functional using exactly the same protocol as in earlier studies pertaining to nuclei but now including neutron star data. This allows direct comparisons of performance of the new functional relative to the standard one. The new functional TOV-min yields results for nuclear bulk properties (energy, r.m.s. radius, diffraction radius, surface thickness) that are of the same quality as those obtained with the established Skyrme functionals, including SV-min. When comparing SV-min and TOV-min, isoscalar nuclear matter indicators vary slightly while isovector properties are changed considerably. We discuss neutron skins, dipole polarizability, separation energies of the heaviest elements, and proton and neutron drip lines. We confirm a correlation between the neutron skin of equationPb and the neutron star radius. We demonstrate that standard energy density functionals optimized to nuclear data do not carry information on the expected maximum neutron star mass, and that predictions can only be made within an extremely broad uncertainty band.

1207.5300,nucl-th,"The nucleon's axial charge, gA, expresses features that are both fundamental to the strong interaction and crucial to its connection with weak interaction physics. We show that dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB) suppresses the axial-charge of a dressed-quark, gAq, at infrared momenta. Since this effect disappears as chiral symmetry is restored, one may argue that gA vanishes with the restoration of chiral symmetry because no nucleon bound-state survives the associated transition. The suppression of gAq is shown to be part of an explanation for a 25% reduction of gA from its nonrelativistic quark-model value. Critical too, however, is the presence of dressed-quark angular momentum within the nucleon. The value of gAq depends on the kernels of the gap and Bethe-Salpeter equations. We find that incorporation of essentially nonperturbative effects associated with DCSB into these kernels inflates the value relative to that obtained at leading-order in a widely used truncation of QCD's Dyson-Schwinger equations. Such corrections also affect the nucleon's axial radius. In both cases, however, agreement with experiment will require similar improvements to the Faddeev kernel and associated interaction current.",12,"['hep-lat', 'hep-ph', 'nucl-ex']",11

In modeling, this instability reveals itself via an apparent negative heat capacity of the system and is seen to result in the volume boiling in the case of infinite matter and surface boiling in the case of finite systems.

Purpose: Develop a new three-body method, which tackles properly the scattering boundary condition for three charged particles and takes into account both the resonant and the non-resonant reaction mechanisms on the same footing, to compute the triple-alpha reaction rate at low temperatures. Methods: We combine the R-matrix expansion, the R-matrix propagation method, and the screening technique in the hyperspherical harmonics basis. Results: Both the equation bound state and the equation resonant state in equationC are well reproduced. We also study the cluster structure of these states. We calculate the triple-alpha reaction rate for equation GK. Conclusions: We obtain the same rate as NACRE for temperatures above 0.07 GK, but the new rate is largely enhanced at lower temperatures (equation at 0.02 GK).

As main physical inference, the elementary particle mixing angles obey a novel phenomenological quark-neutrino (N1)-color and 3 mixing angle symmetric positive definite quadratic Pythagorean equation in terms of double mixing angles. This equation predicts immediately that two large solar and atmospheric angles must be accompanied by one small not zero theta-13 neutrino angle in convincing agreement with recent new theta-13 experimental data. Benchmark flavor mixing pattern - united bimaximal neutrino and zero quark ones - follows from solutions of the primary equation without free parameters. Agreement with known experimental data follows only when the number of quark colors is equal to the number of particle flavors, N = 3.

1201.1189,physics,"Mechanical and sliding instabilities are the two processes which may lead to breaking off events of large ice masses. Mechanical instabilities mainly affect unbalanced cold hanging glaciers. For the latter case, a prediction could be achieved based on data of surface velocities and seismic activity. The case of sliding instabilities is more problematic. This phenomenon occurs on temperate glacier tongues. Such instabilities are strongly affected by the subglacial hydrology: melt water may cause (i) a lubrication of the bed and (ii) a decrease of the effective pressure and consequently a decrease of basal friction. Available data from Allalingletscher (Valais) indicate that the glacier tongue experienced an active phase during 2-3 weeks with enhanced basal motion in late summer in most years. In order to scrutinize in more detail the processes governing the sliding instabilities, a numerical model developed to investigate gravitational instabilities in heterogeneous media was applied to Allalingletscher. This model enables to account for various geometric configurations, interaction between sliding and tension cracking and water flow at the bedrock. We could show that both a critical geometrical configuration of the glacier tongue and the existence of a distributed drainage network were the main causes of this catastrophic break-off.

1207.7090,physics,"Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation is used to study slip at the fluid-solid boundary in an unsteady flow based on the Stokes second problem. An increase in slip is observed in comparison to the steady flow for shear rates below the critical shear rate of the corresponding steady flow. This increased slip is attributed to fluid inertial forces not represented in a steady flow. An unsteady mathematical model for slip is established, which estimates the increment in slip at the boundary. The model shows that slip is also dependent on acceleration in addition to the shear rate of fluid at the wall. By writing acceleration in terms of shear rate, it is shown that slip at the wall in unsteady flows is governed by the gradient of shear rate and shear rate of the fluid. Non-dimensionalizing the model gives a universal curve which can be used to find the slip boundary condition at the fluid-solid interface based on the information of shear rate and gradient of shear rate of the fluid. A governing non-dimensional number, defined as the ratio of phase speed to speed of sound, is identified to help in explaining the mechanism responsible for the transition of slip boundary condition from finite to a perfect slip and determining when this would occur. Phase lag in fluid velocity relative to wall is observed. The lag increases with decreasing time period of wall oscillation and increasing wall hydrophobicity. The phenomenon of hysteresis is seen when looking into the variation of slip velocity as a function of wall velocity and slip velocity as a function of fluid shear rate.

1201.3944,physics,"Recently, antihydrogen atoms were trapped at CERN in a magnetic minimum (minimum-B) trap formed by superconducting octupole and mirror magnet coils. The trapped antiatoms were detected by rapidly turning off these magnets, thereby eliminating the magnetic minimum and releasing any antiatoms contained in the trap. Once released, these antiatoms quickly hit the trap wall, whereupon the positrons and antiprotons in the antiatoms annihilated. The antiproton annihilations produce easily detected signals; we used these signals to prove that we trapped antihydrogen. However, our technique could be confounded by mirror-trapped antiprotons, which would produce seemingly-identical annihilation signals upon hitting the trap wall. In this paper, we discuss possible sources of mirror-trapped antiprotons and show that antihydrogen and antiprotons can be readily distinguished, often with the aid of applied electric fields, by analyzing the annihilation locations and times. We further discuss the general properties of antiproton and antihydrogen trajectories in this magnetic geometry, and reconstruct the antihydrogen energy distribution from the measured annihilation time history.",12,"['hep-ex', 'nucl-ex']",5
1209.0650,physics,"This paper investigates a class of algorithms for numerical integration of a function in d dimensions over a compact domain by Monte Carlo methods. We construct a histogram approximation to the function using a partition of the integration domain into a set of bins specified by some parameters. We then consider two adaptations; the first is to subtract the histogram approximation, whose integral we may easily evaluate explicitly, from the function and integrate the difference using Monte Carlo; the second is to modify the bin parameters in order to make the variance of the Monte Carlo estimate of the integral the same for all bins. This allows us to use Student's t-test as a trigger for rebinning, which we claim is more stable than the letter-squared test that is commonly used for this purpose. We provide a program that we have used to study the algorithm for the case where the histogram is represented as a product of one-dimensional histograms. We discuss the assumptions and approximations made, as well as giving a pedagogical discussion of the myriad ways in which the results of any such Monte Carlo integration program can be misleading.",12,"['hep-lat', 'hep-ph']",5

Measurements in microfluidic devices and lattice Boltzmann simulations demonstrate that the permeability is determined by the Euler characteristic of the conducting phase. We obtain an expression for the permeability that is independent of the percolation threshold and shows agreement with experimental and simulated data over a wide range of porosities. Our approach suggests that the permeability explicitly depends on the overlapping probability of grains rather than their shape.,12,['cond-mat'],5
1203.1978,physics,"The electric dipole-forbidden, quadrupole 6S1/2 <-> 5D3/2 transition in Ba near 2051 nm, with a natural linewidth of 13 mHz, is attractive for potential observation of parity non-conservation, and also as a clock transition for a barium ion optical frequency standard. This transition also offers a direct means of populating the metastable 5D3/2 state to measure the nuclear magnetic octupole moment in the odd barium isotopes.

1208.6116,physics,"The aim of this paper is to propose a 2D computational algorithm for modeling of the trigger and the propagation of shallow landslides caused by rainfall. We used a Molecular Dynamics (MD) inspired model, similar to discrete element method (DEM), that is suitable to model granular material and to observe the trajectory of single particle, so to identify its dynamical properties. We consider that the triggering of shallow landslides is caused by the decrease of the static friction along the sliding surface due to water infiltration by rainfall. Thence the triggering is caused by two following conditions: (a) a threshold speed of the particles and (b) a condition on the static friction, between particles and slope surface, based on the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. The latter static condition is used in the geotechnical model to estimate the possibility of landslide triggering. Finally the interaction force between particles is defined trough a potential that, in the absence of experimental data, we have modeled as the Lennard-Jones 2-1 potential. In the model the viscosity is also introduced and for a large range of values of the model's parameters, we observe a characteristic velocity pattern, with acceleration increments, typical of real landslides. The results of simulations are quite promising: the energy and the time triggering distributions of local avalanches shows a power law distribution, analogous to the observed Gutenberg-Richter and Omori power law distributions for earthquakes. Finally it is possible to apply the method of the inverse surface displacement velocity [Fukuzono 1985] for predicting the failure time.",12,['cond-mat'],5
1210.5875,physics,"In calorimetric neutrino mass experiments, where the shape of a beta decay spectrum has to be precisely measured, the understanding of the detector response function is a fundamental issue. In the MIBETA neutrino mass experiment, the X-ray lines measured with external sources did not have Gaussian shapes, but exhibited a pronounced shoulder towards lower energies. If this shoulder were a general feature of the detector response function, it would distort the beta decay spectrum and thus mimic a non-zero neutrino mass. An investigation was performed to understand the origin of the shoulder and its potential influence on the beta spectrum. First, the peaks were fitted with an analytic function in order to determine quantitatively the amount of events contributing to the shoulder, also depending on the energy of the calibration X-rays. In a second step, Montecarlo simulations were performed to reproduce the experimental spectrum and to understand the origin of its shape. We conclude that at least part of the observed shoulder can be attributed to a surface effect.",12,['nucl-ex'],5

The 1D thermodynamic Axelrod model belongs to the same universality class of the Ising and Potts models, notwithstanding the increase of the internal dimension of the local degree of freedom and the state-dependent bonding interaction.

In both cases the transition to a semiconductor is continuous as a function of the conductivity, unlike the case of a local model. The relevant parameter is the electric screening length and depends on the carrier diffusion constant. We find that for distances comparable to the screening length, vdW-CP data can distinguish between bulk and surface diffusion, hence it can be a sensitive probe for surface states.",12,['cond-mat'],5

Using coordinate transformation, we map this system into 2D corner chiral lenses of 2n heterogeneous anisotropic complementary media sharing a vertex, within which light circles around closed trajectories. Alternatively, one can consider corner lenses with homogeneous isotropic media and map them onto one dimensional PCs with heterogeneous bi-anisotropic layers. Interestingly, such complementary media are described by scalar, or matrix valued, sign-shifting parameters, which satisfy a generalized lens theorem, which can be derived using Fourier series solutions of the Maxwell's equations (in the former case), or from space-time symmetry arguments (in the latter case). Also of interest are 2D periodic checkerboards alternating rectangular cells of complementary media which are such that one point source in one cell gives rise to an infinite set of images with an image in every other cell.

By mapping we set up a block-spin Gaussian model and get a formula connecting the critical point and the minimal fractal dimension of the carrier, which guarantees the uniqueness of a fixed point corresponding to the critical point, changing the complicated calculation of critical point into the simple one of the minimal fractal dimension. The numerical results of critical points with high accuracy for five conventional lattice-Ising models prove our method very effective and may be suitable to all lattice-Ising models.

1201.1619,physics,"Based on classical electrodynamics, it is argued that the Coulomb potential (which is strictly valid for two point charges at rest), commonly used in the study of energy levels of hydrogen atom is not the correct one, because the electron in the hydrogen atom moves with relativistic speeds with respect to the nucleus. Retardation effect has to be considered in accordance with Li\'enard-Wiechert (or retarded) potential of a moving charge or the relativistic electrodynamics. However, such a consideration introduces a correction to the Coulomb potential, whose quantum mechanical expectation value is estimated at equation, which is of the same order as the fine structure of hydrogen atom and hence added to the standard energy eigenvalue values of H-atom. This correction lifts the equation-degeneracy in the spectra of H-atom and hence modifies the standard result. The result disturbs the existing agreement between the theory and experiments on H-atom and hence requires further theoretical and experimental re-examination. The implications of this result for the Kepler-problem in general is also discussed in the context of Heaviside's gravity, which seems to offer an alternative explanation for the non-Newtonian perihelion advance of Mercury without invoking the space-time curvature formalism of Einstein's general theory of relativity.",12,[],5

For high values of C, turbulence evolves toward highly anisotropic states with a dominant contribution of the zonal sector to the kinetic energy. This anisotropic flow leads to a decrease of a turbulence production in the meridional sector and limits the particle transport across the mean isopycnal surfaces.

Our aim is to detail the theoretical description of ultra-short time-delays, and to relate these to the phase of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light pulses and to the asymptotic phase-shifts of photoelectron wave packets. Special emphasis is laid on time-delay experiments, where attosecond XUV pulses are used to photoionize target atoms at well-defined times, followed by a probing process in real time by a phase-locked, infrared laser field. In this way, the laser field serves as a ""clock"" to monitor the ionization event, but the observable delays do not correspond directly to the delay associated with single-photon ionization. Instead, a significant part of the observed delay originates from a measurement induced process, which obscures the single-photon ionization dynamics. This artifact is traced back to a phase-shift of the above-threshold ionization transition matrix element, which we call the continuum-continuum phase. It arises due to the laser-stimulated transitions between Coulomb continuum states. As we shall show here, these measurement-induced effects can be separated from the single-photon ionization process, using analytical expressions of universal character, so that eventually the attosecond time-delays in photoionization can be accessed.",12,['quant-ph'],5

Added value could be obtained by using 89Sr for cancer treatments. Known technologies could be used to relate into innovative ways LWR, to obtain nuclear energy at battery scale. LWR interact by contact with scintillators converting letter-radiation into light-energy. This would lead to manufacturing scintillator lamps which operate independently of other source of energy.

1208.4066,q-bio,"Constructing gene interaction networks (GINs) from high-throughput gene expression data is an important and challenging problem in systems biology. Existing algorithms produce networks that either have undirected and unweighted edges, or else are constrained to contain no cycles, both of which are biologically unrealistic. In the present paper we propose a new algorithm, based on a concept from probability theory known as the phi-mixing coefficient, that produces networks whose edges are weighted and directed, and are permitted to contain cycles. Because there is no ""ground truth"" for genome-wide networks on a human scale, we analyzed the outcomes of several experiments on lung cancer, and matched the predictions from the inferred networks with experimental results. Specifically, we inferred three networks (NSCLC, Neuro-endocrine NSCLC plus SCLC, and normal) from the gene expression measurements of 157 lung cancer and 59 normal cell lines, compared with the outcomes of siRNA screening of 19,000 genes on 11 NSCLC cell lines, and analyzed data from a ChIP-Seq experiment to determine putative downstream targets of the lineage specific oncogenic transcription factor ASCL1. The inferred networks displayed a scale-free or power law behavior between the degree of a node and the number of nodes with that degree. There was a strong correlation between the degree of a gene in the inferred NSCLC network and its essentiality for the survival of the cells. The inferred downstream neighborhood genes of ASCL1 in the SCLC network were significantly enriched by ChIP-Seq determined putative target genes, while no such enrichment was found in the inferred NSCLC network.",12,['stat'],10
1203.3367,q-bio,"We present a general framework to describe the evolutionary dynamics of an arbitrary number of types in finite populations based on stochastic differential equations (SDE). For large, but finite populations this allows to include demographic noise without requiring explicit simulations. Instead, the population size only rescales the amplitude of the noise. Moreover, this framework admits the inclusion of mutations between different types, provided that mutation rates, equation, are not too small compared to the inverse population size 1/N. This ensures that all types are almost always represented in the population and that the occasional extinction of one type does not result in an extended absence of that type. For equation this limits the use of SDE's, but in this case there are well established alternative approximations based on time scale separation. We illustrate our approach by a Rock-Scissors-Paper game with mutations, where we demonstrate excellent agreement with simulation based results for sufficiently large populations. In the absence of mutations the excellent agreement extends to small population sizes.",12,"['cond-mat', 'physics']",10
1209.4890,q-bio,"Spontaneous fluctuations of the BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent) signal, measured with fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging), display a rich and neurobiologically relevant functional connectivity structure. This structure is usually revealed using time averaging methods, which prevent the detection of functional connectivity changes over time. In this work we studied the electrophysiological correlates of dynamical BOLD functional connectivity fluctuations, by means of long (approx. 50 min) joint electroencephalographic (EEG) and fMRI recordings. We identified widespread positive and negative correlations between EEG spectral power and fMRI BOLD connectivity fluctuations in a network of 90 cortical and subcortical regions. In particular, increased alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) power were related to decreased functional connectivity, whereas gamma (30-60 Hz) power correlated positively with BOLD connectivity between specific brain regions. Furthermore, these patterns were altered for subjects undergoing vigilance changes, with an involvement of the slow delta (0.4 - 4 Hz) band in localized positive correlations. Finally, graph theoretical indices of network structure also exhibited sharp changes over time, with average path length correlating positively with alpha power extracted from central and frontal electrodes. Our results strongly suggest that non-stationary BOLD functional connectivity has a neurophysiological origin. Positive correlations of BOLD connectivity with gamma can be interpreted as increased average binding over relatively long periods of time, possibly due to spontaneous cognition occurring during rest. Negative correlations with alpha suggest functional inhibition of local and long-range connectivity, associated with an idling state of the brain.",12,[],10
1205.0793,q-bio,"Approaches for testing sets of variants, such as a set of rare or common variants within a gene or pathway, for association with complex traits are important. In particular, set tests allow for aggregation of weak signal within a set, can capture interplay among variants, and reduce the burden of multiple hypothesis testing. Until now, these approaches did not address confounding by family relatedness and population structure, a problem that is becoming more important as larger data sets are used to increase power.   Results: We introduce a new approach for set tests that handles confounders. Our model is based on the linear mixed model and uses two random effects-one to capture the set association signal and one to capture confounders. We also introduce a computational speedup for two-random-effects models that makes this approach feasible even for extremely large cohorts. Using this model with both the likelihood ratio test and score test, we find that the former yields more power while controlling type I error. Application of our approach to richly structured GAW14 data demonstrates that our method successfully corrects for population structure and family relatedness, while application of our method to a 15,000 individual Crohn's disease case-control cohort demonstrates that it additionally recovers genes not recoverable by univariate analysis.

Relying only on a prior distribution for the underlying species tree (conditioned on the number, n, of extant species) we study the random vector (X1,...,Xn) of the observed trait values. In this paper we derive compact formulae for the variance of the sample mean and the mean of the sample variance for the vector (X1,...,Xn).   The key ingredient of these formulae is the correlation coefficient between two trait values randomly chosen from (X1,...,Xn). This interspecies correlation coefficient takes into account not only variation due to the random sampling of two species out of n and the stochastic nature of Brownian motion but also the uncertainty in the phylogenetic tree. The latter is modeled by a (supercritical or critical) conditioned branching process. In the critical case we modify the Aldous-Popovic model by assuming a proper prior for the time of origin.",12,[],10

1212.5188,q-bio,"Shannon's seminal 1948 work gave rise to two distinct areas of research: information theory and mathematical coding theory. While information theory has had a strong influence on theoretical neuroscience, ideas from mathematical coding theory have received considerably less attention. Here we take a new look at combinatorial neural codes from a mathematical coding theory perspective, examining the error correction capabilities of familiar receptive field codes (RF codes). We find, perhaps surprisingly, that the high levels of redundancy present in these codes does not support accurate error correction, although the error-correcting performance of RF codes ""catches up"" to that of random comparison codes when a small tolerance to error is introduced. On the other hand, RF codes are good at reflecting distances between represented stimuli, while the random comparison codes are not. We suggest that a compromise in error-correcting capability may be a necessary price to pay for a neural code whose structure serves not only error correction, but must also reflect relationships between stimuli.",12,"['cs', 'math']",10

Given the important role for dopamine in modulating emotions involved in social anxiety we investigated whether TRPC4 protein and mRNA was found on dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Using emulsion autoradiography we found that TRPC4 mRNA is indeed present in the VTA and the substantia nigra. Additionally, immunohistochemistry verified it's presence on a subpopulation of dopamine neurons in the VTA.

1206.0536,q-bio,"One of the challenges in analyzing high-dimensional expression data is the detection of important biological signals. A common approach is to apply a dimension reduction method, such as principal component analysis. Typically, after application of such a method the data is projected and visualized in the new coordinate system, using scatter plots or profile plots. These methods provide good results if the data have certain properties which become visible in the new coordinate system and which were hard to detect in the original coordinate system. Often however, the application of only one method does not suffice to capture all important signals. Therefore several methods addressing different aspects of the data need to be applied. We have developed a framework for linear and non-linear dimension reduction methods within our visual analytics pipeline SpRay. This includes measures that assist the interpretation of the factorization result. Different visualizations of these measures can be combined with functional annotations that support the interpretation of the results.

1212.0587,q-bio,"Large scale surveys in mammalian tissue culture cells suggest that the protein expressed at the median abundance is present at 8,000 - 16,000 molecules per cell and that differences in mRNA expression between genes explain only 10-40% of the differences in protein levels. We find, however, that these surveys have significantly underestimated protein abundances and the relative importance of transcription. Using individual measurements for 61 housekeeping proteins to rescale whole proteome data from Schwanhausser et al., we find that the median protein detected is expressed at 170,000 molecules per cell and that our corrected protein abundance estimates show a higher correlation with mRNA abundances than do the uncorrected protein data. In addition, we estimated the impact of further errors in mRNA and protein abundances, showing that mRNA levels explain at least 56% of the differences in protein abundance for the genes detected by Schwanhausser et al., though because one major source of error could not be estimated the true percent contribution could be higher. We also employed a second, independent strategy to determine the contribution of mRNA levels to protein expression. We show that the variance in translation rates directly measured by ribosome profiling is only 12% of that inferred by Schwanhausser et al. and that the measured and inferred translation rates correlate only poorly (R2=0.13). Based on this, our second strategy suggests that mRNA levels explain ~81% of the variance in protein levels. We also determined the percent contributions of transcription, RNA degradation, translation and protein degradation to the variance in protein abundances using both of our strategies. While the magnitudes of the two estimates vary, they both suggest that transcription plays a more important role than the earlier studies implied and translation a much smaller role.",12,[],10
1203.0868,q-bio,"Human brain contains about 10 billion neurons, each of which has about 10~10,000 nerve endings from which neurotransmitters are released in response to incoming spikes, and the released neurotransmitters then bind to receptors located in the postsynaptic neurons. However, individually, neurons are noisy and synaptic release is in general unreliable. But groups of neurons that are arranged in specialized modules can collectively perform complex information processing tasks robustly and reliably. How functionally groups of neurons perform behavioural related tasks crucial rely on a coherent organization of dynamics from membrane ionic kinetics to synaptic coupling of the network and dynamics of rhythmic oscillations that are tightly linked to behavioural state.   To capture essential features of the biological system at multiple spatial-temporal scales, it is important to construct a suitable computational model that is closely or solely based on experimental data.

1209.1912,q-bio,"Information processing and decision making is based upon logic operations, which in cellular networks has been well characterized at the level of transcription. In recent years however, both experimentalists and theorists have begun to appreciate that cellular decision making can also be performed at the level of a single protein, giving rise to the notion of protein logic. Here we systematically explore protein logic using a well known statistical mechanical model. As an example system, we focus on receptors which bind either one or two ligands, and their associated dimers. Notably, we find that a single heterodimer can realize any of the 16 possible logic gates, including the XOR gate, by variation of biochemical parameters. We then introduce the novel idea that a set of receptors with fixed parameters can encode functionally unique logic gates simply by forming different dimeric combinations. An exhaustive search reveals that the simplest set of receptors (two single-ligand receptors and one double-ligand receptor) can realize several different groups of three unique gates, a result for which the parametric analysis of single receptors and dimers provides a clear interpretation. Both results underscore the surprising functional freedom readily available to cells at the single-protein level.",12,[],10

Here we show that this holds if one or both of the following conditions holds: (1) T is bounded by a function of r; (2) the maximum degree of the nodes in T is bounded by a function of r. These sufficient conditions absorb and significantly extend known special cases, namely when all the trees in T are binary, or T contains exactly two nonbinary trees. We believe this result is an important step towards settling the issue for an arbitrarily large and complex set of nonbinary trees.

Complete Wolbachia and mitochondrial genomes show congruent phylogenies, consistent with strict vertical transmission through the maternal cytoplasm and imperfect transmission of Wolbachia. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis reveals that the most recent common ancestor of all Wolbachia and mitochondrial genomes in D. melanogaster dates to around 8,000 years ago.

1205.6010,q-bio,"Nucleosome organization in eukaryotic genomes has a deep impact on gene function. Although progress has been recently made in the identification of various concurring factors influencing nucleosome positioning, it is still unclear whether nucleosome positions are sequence dictated or determined by a random process. It has been postulated for a long time that,in the proximity of TSS, a barrier determines the position of the 1 nucleosome and then geometric constraints alter the random positioning process determining nucleosomal phasing. Such a pattern fades out as one moves away from the barrier to become again a random positioning process. Although this statistical model is widely accepted,the molecular nature of the barrier is still unknown. Moreover,we are far from the identification of a set of sequence rules able:to account for the genome-wide nucleosome organization;to explain the nature of the barriers on which the statistical mechanism hinges;to allow for a smooth transition from sequence-dictated to statistical positioning and back. We show that sequence complexity,quantified via various methods, can be the rule able to at least partially account for all the above.In particular, we have conducted our analyses on 4 high resolution nucleosomal maps of the model eukaryotes and found that nucleosome depleted regions can be well distinguished from nucleosome enriched regions by sequence complexity measures.In particular, (a) the depleted regions are less complex than the enriched ones, (b) around TSS complexity measures alone are in striking agreement with in vivo nucleosome occupancy,in particular precisely indicating the positions of the 1 and -1 nucleosomes.

Here we challenge this conclusion, by analyzing evolution in a framework which allows for complex group interactions and random migration among groups. We conclude that contingent forms of strong altruism can spread when rare under realistic group sizes and levels of migration.

The theory explains the embryogenesis of all known variations of gynandromorphs found in multicellular organisms. The theory also predicts a large variety of more subtle gynandromorphic morphologies yet to be discovered. The network theory of gynandromorph development has direct relevance to understanding sexual dimorphism (differences in morphology between male and female organisms of the same species) and medical pathologies such as hemihyperplasia (asymmetric development of normally symmetric body parts in a unisexual individual). The network theory of gynandromorphs brings up fundamental open questions about developmental control in ontogeny. This in turn suggests a new theory of the origin and evolution of species that is based on cooperative interactions and conflicts between developmental control networks in the haploid genomes and epigenomes of potential sexual partners for reproduction.

1202.3015,q-bio,"The cellular phenotype is described by a complex network of molecular interactions. Elucidating network properties that distinguish disease from the healthy cellular state is therefore of critical importance for gaining systems-level insights into disease mechanisms and ultimately for developing improved therapies. By integrating gene expression data with a protein interaction network to induce a stochastic dynamics on the network, we here demonstrate that cancer cells are characterised by an increase in the dynamic network entropy, compared to cells of normal physiology. Using a fundamental relation between the macroscopic resilience of a dynamical system and the uncertainty (entropy) in the underlying microscopic processes, we argue that cancer cells will be more robust to random gene perturbations. In addition, we formally demonstrate that gene expression differences between normal and cancer tissue are anticorrelated with local dynamic entropy changes, thus providing a systemic link between gene expression changes at the nodes and their local network dynamics. In particular, we also find that genes which drive cell-proliferation in cancer cells and which often encode oncogenes are associated with reductions in the dynamic network entropy. In summary, our results support the view that the observed increased robustness of cancer cells to perturbation and therapy may be due to an increase in the dynamic network entropy that allows cells to adapt to the new cellular stresses. Conversely, genes that exhibit local flux entropy decreases in cancer may render cancer cells more susceptible to targeted intervention and may therefore represent promising drug targets.",12,['cond-mat'],10

In this paper we present a mathematical model for the dynamics of an immune response to a viral infection and autoimmunity, which takes into account T cells with different activation thresholds. We show how the infection can be cleared by the immune system, as well as how it can lead to a chronic infection or recurrent infection with relapses and remissions.

1206.5738,q-bio,"DNA is subject to large deformations in a wide range of biological processes. Two key examples illustrate how such deformations influence the readout of the genetic information: the sequestering of eukaryotic genes by nucleosomes, and DNA looping in transcriptional regulation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. These kinds of regulatory problems are now becoming amenable to systematic quantitative dissection with a powerful dialogue between theory and experiment. Here we use a single-molecule experiment in conjunction with a statistical mechanical model to test quantitative predictions for the behavior of DNA looping at short length scales, and to determine how DNA sequence affects looping at these lengths. We calculate and measure how such looping depends upon four key biological parameters: the strength of the transcription factor binding sites, the concentration of the transcription factor, and the length and sequence of the DNA loop. Our studies lead to the surprising insight that sequences that are thought to be especially favorable for nucleosome formation because of high flexibility lead to no systematically detectable effect of sequence on looping, and begin to provide a picture of the distinctions between the short length scale mechanics of nucleosome formation and looping.",12,[],10

Here, we study the effects of random noise on the stability of memory stored in synapses of an attractor neural network. The model includes ongoing spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP). We show that certain classes of STDP rules can lead to the stabilization of memory patterns stored in the network. The stabilization results from rehearsals induced by noise. We show that unstructured neural noise, after passing through the recurrent network weights, carries the imprint of all memory patterns in temporal correlations. Under certain conditions, STDP combined with these correlations, can lead to reinforcement of all existing patterns, even those that are never explicitly visited. Thus, unstructured neural noise can stabilize the existing structure of synaptic connectivity.

In several empirical networks, the time between two consecutive vertex-activation events typically follows heterogeneous activity (e.g. bursts).

The model assumes no underlying topological structure and is only constrained by the time between two consecutive events of vertex activation. The main observation is that the speed of the infection spread is different in case of heterogeneous and homogeneous temporal patterns but the differences depend on the stage of the epidemics. In comparison to the homogeneous scenario, the power law case results in a faster growth in the beginning but turns out to be slower after a certain time, taking several time steps to reach the whole network.",12,['physics'],10

However, we have found that arsenate does not contribute to growth of GFAJ-1 when phosphate is limiting and that DNA purified from cells grown with limiting phosphate and abundant arsenate does not exhibit the spontaneous hydrolysis expected of arsenate ester bonds. Furthermore, mass spectrometry showed that this DNA contains only trace amounts of free arsenate and no detectable covalently bound arsenate.",12,[],10
1212.5761,q-bio,"Leaf area LA, is a plant biometric index important to agroforestry and crop production. Previous works have demonstrated the conservativeness of the inverse of the product of the fresh leaf density and thickness, the so-called Hughes constant, K. We use this fact to develop LAMM, an absolute method of LA measurement, i.e. no regression fits or prior calibrations with planimeters. Nor does it require drying the leaves. The concept involves the in situ determination of K using geometrical shapes and their weights obtained from a subset of fresh leaves of the set whose areas are desired. Subsequently the LAs, at any desired stratification level, are derived by utilizing K and the previously measured masses of the fresh leaves. The concept was first tested in the simulated ideal case of complete planarity and uniform thickness by using plastic film covered card-paper sheets. Next the species-specific conservativeness of K over individual leaf zones and different leaf types from leaves of plants from two species, Mandevilla splendens and Spathiphyllum wallisii, was quantitatively validated. Using the global average K values, the LA of these and additional plants, were obtained. LAMM was found to be a rapid, simple, economic technique with accuracies, as measured for the geometrical shapes, that were comparable to those obtained by the planimetric method that utilizes digital image analysis, DIA. For the leaves themselves, there were no statistically significant differences between the LAs measured by LAMM and by the DIA and the linear correlation between the two methods was excellent.",12,[],10
1212.1874,q-bio,"Unraveling the structure of complex biological networks and relating it to their functional role is an important task in systems biology. Here we attempt to characterize the functional organization of the large-scale metabolic networks of three microorganisms. We apply flux balance analysis to study the optimal growth states of these organisms in different environments. By investigating the differential usage of reactions across flux patterns for different environments, we observe a striking bimodal distribution in the activity of reactions. Motivated by this, we propose a simple algorithm to decompose the metabolic network into three sub-networks. It turns out that our reaction classifier which is blind to the biochemical role of pathways leads to three functionally relevant sub-networks that correspond to input, output and intermediate parts of the metabolic network with distinct structural characteristics. Our decomposition method unveils a functional bow-tie organization of metabolic networks that is different from the bow-tie structure determined by graph-theoretic methods that do not incorporate functionality.",12,[],10

We study the inverse problem, how the code structure affects the optimal physico-chemical parameters of amino acids ensuring the highest stability of the genetic code. It is shown that the choice of two or more amino acids with given properties determines unambiguously all the others. In this sense the code structure determines strictly the optimal parameters of amino acids. In the code with the structure of the standard genetic code the resulting values for hydrophobicity obtained in the scheme leave one out and in the scheme with fixed maximum and minimum parameters correlate significantly with the natural scale. This indicates the co-evolution of the genetic code and physico-chemical properties of amino acids.",12,[],10
1206.2311,q-bio,"Developmental dynamics of multicellular organism is a process that takes place in a multi-stable system in which each attractor state represents a cell type and attractor transitions correspond to cell differentiation paths. This new understanding has revived the idea of a quasi-potential landscape, first proposed by Waddington as a metaphor. To describe development one is interested in the ""relative stabilities"" of N attractors (N>2). Existing theories of state transition between local minima on some potential landscape deal with the exit in the transition between a pair attractor but do not offer the notion of a global potential function that relate more than two attractors to each other. Several ad hoc methods have been used in systems biology to compute a landscape in non-gradient systems, such as gene regulatory networks. Here we present an overview of the currently available methods, discuss their limitations and propose a new decomposition of vector fields that permit the computation of a quasi-potential function that is equivalent to the Freidlin-Wentzell potential but is not limited to two attractors. Several examples of decomposition are given and the significance of such a quasi-potential function is discussed.",12,['cond-mat'],10
1201.5578,q-bio,"Modeling stochasticity in gene regulatory networks is an important and complex problem in molecular systems biology. To elucidate intrinsic noise, several modeling strategies such as the Gillespie algorithm have been used successfully. This paper contributes an approach as an alternative to these classical settings. Within the discrete paradigm, where genes, proteins, and other molecular components of gene regulatory networks are modeled as discrete variables and are assigned as logical rules describing their regulation through interactions with other components. Stochasticity is modeled at the biological function level under the assumption that even if the expression levels of the input nodes of an update rule guarantee activation or degradation there is a probability that the process will not occur due to stochastic effects. This approach allows a finer analysis of discrete models and provides a natural setup for cell population simulations to study cell-to-cell variability.

However, an efficient system to discriminate the cell lines is lacking. Here, we developed a quantitative system to discriminate the three cell types, iPSCs, ESCs and SCs. The system contains DNA-methylation biomarkers and mathematical models, including an artificial neural network and support vector machines. All biomarkers were unbiasedly selected by calculating an eigengene score derived from analysis of genome-wide DNA methylations. With 30 biomarkers, or even with as few as 3 top biomarkers, this system can discriminate SCs from ESCs and iPSCs with almost 100% accuracy, and with approximately 100 biomarkers, the system can distinguish ESCs from iPSCs with an accuracy of 95%. This robust system performs precisely with raw data without normalization as well as with converted data in which the continuous methylation levels are accounted. Strikingly, this system can even accurately predict new samples generated from different microarray platforms and the next-generation sequencing. The subtypes of cells, such as female and male iPSCs and fetal and adult SCs, can also be discriminated with this system. Thus, this quantitative system works as a novel general and accurate framework for discriminating the three cell types, iPSCs, ESCs, and SCs and this strategy supports the notion that DNA-methylation generally varies among the three cell types.",12,[],10
1211.1303,q-bio,"In this article it is shown how optimized and dedicated microarray experiments can be used to study the thermodynamics of DNA hybridization for a large number of different conformations in a highly parallel fashion. In particular, free energy penalties for mismatches are obtained in two independent ways and are shown to be correlated with values from melting experiments in solution reported in the literature. The additivity principle, which is at the basis of the nearest-neighbor model, and according to which the penalty for two isolated mismatches is equal to the sum of the independent penalties, is thoroughly tested. Additivity is shown to break down for a mismatch distance below 5 nt. The behavior of mismatches in the vicinity of the helix edges, and the behavior of tandem mismatches are also investigated. Finally, some thermodynamic outlying sequences are observed and highlighted. These sequences contain combinations of GA mismatches.

1206.4209,q-bio,"Genotype-to-phenotype maps and the related fitness landscapes that include epistatic interactions are difficult to measure because of their high dimensional structure. Here we construct such a map using the recently collected corpora of high-throughput sequence data from the 75 base pairs long mutagenized E. coli lac promoter region, where each sequence is associated with its phenotype, the induced transcriptional activity measured by a fluorescent reporter. We find that the additive (non-epistatic) contributions of individual mutations account for about two-thirds of the explainable phenotype variance, while pairwise epistasis explains about 7% of the variance for the full mutagenized sequence and about 15% for the subsequence associated with protein binding sites. Surprisingly, there is no evidence for third order epistatic contributions, and our inferred fitness landscape is essentially single peaked, with a small amount of antagonistic epistasis. There is a significant selective pressure on the wild type, which we deduce to be multi-objective optimal for gene expression in environments with different nutrient sources. We identify transcription factor (CRP) and RNA polymerase binding sites in the promotor region and their interactions without difficult optimization steps. In particular, we observe evidence for previously unexplored genetic regulatory mechanisms, possibly kinetic in nature. We conclude with a cautionary note that inferred properties of fitness landscapes may be severely influenced by biases in the sequence data.",12,[],10

In this paper, we consider sudden regime shifts in the gene expression dynamics described by a fold-bifurcation model involving bistability and hysteresis. We consider two alternative models, Models 1 and 2, of competence development in the bacterial population B. subtilis and determine some early signatures of the regime shifts between competence and noncompetence. We use both deterministic and stochastic formalisms for the purpose of our study. The early signatures studied include the critical slowing down as a transition point is approached, rising variance and the lag-1 autocorrelation function, skewness and a ratio of two mean first passage times.

Infection by one disease confers immediate and permanent immunity to infection by any disease. Under these assumptions, we find a simple, low-dimensional ordinary differential equations model which captures the global dynamics of the infection. The dynamics depend strongly on initial conditions. Although we motivate this article with infectious disease, the model may be adapted to the spread of other infectious agents such as competing political beliefs, rumors, or adoption of new technologies if these are influenced by contacts.

1209.6607,q-bio,"The latency of visual responses generally decreases as contrast increases. Recording in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), we find that response latency increases with increasing contrast in ON cells for some visual stimuli. We propose that this surprising latency trend can be explained if ON cells rest further from threshold at higher contrasts. Indeed, while contrast changes caused a combination of multiplicative gain change and additive shift in LGN cells, the additive shift predominated in ON cells. Modeling results supported this theory: the ON cell latency trend was found when the distance-to-threshold shifted with contrast, but not when distance-to-threshold was fixed across contrasts. In the model, latency also increases as surround-to-center ratios increase, which has been shown to occur at higher contrasts. We propose that higher-contrast full-field stimuli can evoke more surround inhibition, shifting the potential further from spiking threshold and thereby increasing response latency.",12,[],10
1208.2583,q-bio,"We introduce and analyze a purely competitive dynamics for the evolution of an infinite population subject to a 3-strategy game. We argue that this dynamics represents a characterization of how certain systems, both natural and artificial, are governed. In each period, the population is randomly sorted into pairs, which engage in a once-off play of the game; the probability that a member propagates its type to its offspring is proportional only to its payoff within the pair. We show that if a type is dominant (obtains higher payoffs in games with both other types), its 'pure' population state, comprising only members of that type, is globally attracting. If there is no dominant type, there is an unstable 'mixed' fixed point; the population state eventually oscillates between the three near-pure states. We then allow for mutations, where offspring have a non-zero probability of randomly changing their type. In this case, the existence of a dominant type renders a point near its pure state globally attracting. If no dominant type exists, a supercritical Hopf bifurcation occurs at the unique mixed fixed point, and above a critical (typically low) mutation rate, this fixed point becomes globally attracting: the implication is that even very low mutation rates can stabilize a system that would, in the absence of mutations, be unstable.",12,"['cs', 'math']",10
1201.3232,q-bio,"Malaria disease is a major global health and economic development threat. It results in approximately 2.7 million deaths annually. There is currently no vaccine that has been licensed for use against malaria. Studies in animal models, especially non-human primates can lead to the revelation of possible immunological mechanisms that can lead to protection or predisposition of the host to malaria. Plasmodium knowlesi, a simian and human malaria parasite, is an attractive experimental parasite for malaria research since it can infect olive baboons (Papio anubis), non-human primates that have similar host-pathogen interactions to humans. This study was carried out to determine host immunological profiles provoked in olive baboons during the course of an infection with Plasmodium knowlesi. A total of eight adult baboons were intravenously inoculated with overnight cultured blood stage P. knowlesi H strain parasites. Five of these baboons became acutely infected while the other three became chronically infected. The immunological basis of this dual outcome of the infection was determined by measuring circulating cytokine (T helper 1 and T helper 2) and antibody (immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M) responses elicited in the infected baboons on a weekly basis by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for up to six weeks post infection. Generated data for the first time indicated that acute P. knowlesi malaria is accompanied by increased concentrations of interferon gamma (IFN gamma), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and IL 6 and reduced levels of circulating interleukin 10 (IL 10), IL 4, IL 12, immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM in the baboon host.

The inverse problem that we need to solve in constructing the model is analytically tractable, and provides a natural ""thermodynamics"" for the network in the limit of large N.

1210.3229,q-bio,"The instantaneous state of a neural network consists of both the degree of excitation of each neuron the network is composed of and positions of impulses in communication lines between the neurons. In neurophysiological experiments, the neuronal firing moments are registered, but not the state of communication lines. But future spiking moments depend essentially on the past positions of impulses in the lines. This suggests, that the sequence of intervals between firing moments (inter-spike intervals, ISIs) in the network could be non-Markovian.   In this paper, we address this question for a simplest possible neural ""net"", namely, a single inhibitory neuron with delayed feedback. The neuron receives excitatory input from the driving Poisson stream and inhibitory impulses from its own output through the feedback line. We obtain analytic expressions for conditional probability density P(tn1 tn,...,t1,t0), which gives the probability to get an output ISI of duration tn1 provided the previous (n1) output ISIs had durations tn,...,t1,t0. It is proven exactly, that P(tn1 tn,...,t1,t0) does not reduce to P(tn1 tn,...,t1) for any n>=0.

For that purpose in the last years there has been a growing interest in approaches that try to integrate information from molecular interaction networks. Results: We propose a novel algorithm, called FrSVM, which integrates protein-protein interaction network information into gene selection for prognostic biomarker discovery. Our method is a simple filter based approach, which focuses on central genes with large differences in their expression. Compared to several other competing methods our algorithm reveals a significantly better prediction performance and higher signature stability.

1205.3246,q-bio,"Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a likelihood-free approach for Bayesian inferences based on a rejection algorithm method that applies a tolerance of dissimilarity between summary statistics from observed and simulated data. Although several improvements to the algorithm have been proposed, none of these improvements avoid the following two sources of approximation: 1) lack of sufficient statistics: sampling is not from the true posterior density given data but from an approximate posterior density given summary statistics; and 2) non-zero tolerance: sampling from the posterior density given summary statistics is achieved only in the limit of zero tolerance. The first source of approximation can be improved by adding a summary statistic, but an increase in the number of summary statistics could introduce additional variance caused by the low acceptance rate. Consequently, many researchers have attempted to develop techniques to choose informative summary statistics. The present study evaluated the utility of a kernel-based ABC method (Fukumizu et al. 2010, arXiv:1009.5736 and 2011, NIPS 24: 1549-1557) for complex problems that demand many summary statistics.

We applied a new phylogenomic approach to resolve relationships in Neoaves using target enrichment (sequence capture) and high-throughput sequencing of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) in avian genomes. We collected sequence data from UCE loci for 32 members of Neoaves and one outgroup (chicken) and analyzed data sets that differed in their amount of missing data. An alignment of 1,541 loci that allowed missing data was 87% complete and resulted in a highly resolved phylogeny with broad agreement between the Bayesian and maximum-likelihood (ML) trees. Although results from the 100% complete matrix of 416 UCE loci were similar, the Bayesian and ML trees differed to a greater extent in this analysis, suggesting that increasing from 416 to 1,541 loci led to increased stability and resolution of the tree. Novel results of our study include surprisingly close relationships between phenotypically divergent bird families, such as tropicbirds (Phaethontidae) and the sunbittern (Eurypygidae) as well as between bustards (Otididae) and turacos (Musophagidae). This phylogeny bolsters support for monophyletic waterbird and landbird clades and also strongly supports controversial results from previous studies, including the sister relationship between passerines and parrots and the non-monophyly of raptorial birds in the hawk and falcon families.

We wish to argue that the evolution of life marks the end of a physics world view of law entailed dynamics. Our considerations depend upon discussing the variability of the very ""contexts of life"": the interactions between organisms, biological niches and ecosystems. These are ever changing, intrinsically indeterminate and even unprestatable: we do not know ahead of time the ""niches"" which constitute the boundary conditions on selection. More generally, by the mathematical unprestatability of the ""phase space"" (space of possibilities), no laws of motion can be formulated for evolution. We call this radical emergence, from life to life. The purpose of this paper is the integration of variation and diversity in a sound conceptual frame and situate unpredictability at a novel theoretical level, that of the very phase space. Our argument will be carried on in close comparisons with physics and the mathematical constructions of phase spaces in that discipline. The role of (theoretical) symmetries as invariant preserving transformations will allow us to understand the nature of physical phase spaces and to stress the differences required for a sound biological theoretizing. In this frame, we discuss the novel notion of ""enablement"". This will restrict causal analyses to differential cases (a difference that causes a difference). Mutations or other causal differences will allow us to stress that ""non conservation principles"" are at the core of evolution, in contrast to physical dynamics, largely based on conservation principles as symmetries. Critical transitions, the main locus of symmetry changes in physics, will be discussed, and lead to ""extended criticality"" as a conceptual frame for a better understanding of the living state of matter.",12,['physics'],10

In the central nervous system, SWN models have been shown to fit well both anatomical and functional maps at the macroscopic level. However the functional microscopic level, where the nodes of a network are composed of single neurons, is still poorly understood. At this level, although recent evidences suggest that functional connectivity maps exhibit small-world organization, it is not known whether and how these maps, distributed in multiple brain regions, change across different conditions. We addressed these questions by simultaneous multi-array extracellular recordings in three brain regions diversely involved in somatosensory information processing: the ventropostero-lateral thalamic nuclei (VPL), the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the centro-median thalamic nuclei (CM). From both spike and Local Field Potential (LFP) recordings, we estimated the functional connectivity maps by using the Normalized Compression Similarity (spikes) and the Phase Synchrony (LFPs). Then, by using graph-theoretical statistics, we characterized the functional map topology both during spontaneous activity and sensory stimulation. Our main results show that: (i) spikes and LFPs show SWN organization during spontaneous activity; (ii) After stimulation onset, while substantial functional map reconfigurations occur both in spike and LFPs, small-worldness is nonetheless preserved (iii) The stimulus triggers a significant increase of inter-area LFP connections without modifying the topology of intra-area functional connections; (iv) Through computer simulations of the fundamental concept of cell assemblies, transient groups of activating neurons can be described by small-world networks.",12,[],10

However, the removal of a reaction and its impact on the network may as well be interpreted as selective regulation of pathway activities, suggesting a tradeoff between the efficiency of regulation and vulnerability. Here, we employ a cascading failure algorithm to simulate the removal of single and pairs of reactions from the metabolic networks of two organisms, and estimate the significance of the results using two different null models: degree preserving and mass-balanced randomization.

Response latency was longer in correct trials compared to error trials. Discrimination accuracy increased with response latency over the range of 500-1200ms. We used morphs between previously learned images to vary the image similarity parametrically, and thereby modulate task difficulty from ceiling to chance.

As a result of this, the average number of species in the considered territory, the relative species abundance distribution, the species-area relationship and the spatial auto-correlation function of the individuals in abundant species are simultaneously fitted with only one parameter which is the average surviving time of the seeds.",12,[],10
1205.6989,q-bio,"We study a stochastic epidemic model consisting of elements (organisms in a community or cells in tissue) with fixed positions, in which damage or disease is transmitted by diffusing agents (""signals"") emitted by infected individuals. The signals decay as well as diffuse; since they are assumed to be produced in large numbers, the signal concentration is treated deterministically. The model, which includes four cellular states (susceptible, transformed, depleted, and removed), admits various interpretations: spread of an infection or infectious disease, or of damage in a tissue in which injured cells may themselves provoke further damage, and as a description of the so-called radiation-induced bystander effect, in which the signals are molecules capable of inducing cell damage and/or death in unirradiated cells. The model exhibits a continuous phase transition between spreading and nonspreading phases. We formulate two mean-field theory (MFT) descriptions of the model, one of which ignores correlations between the cellular state and the signal concentration, and another that treats such correlations in an approximate manner. Monte Carlo simulations of the spread of infection on the square lattice yield values for the critical exponents and the fractal dimension consistent with the dynamic percolation universality class.",12,['cond-mat'],10
1209.0725,q-bio,"To better understand and manage complex systems like ecosystems it is critical to know the relative contribution of system components to system functioning. Ecologists and social scientists have described many ways that individuals can be important; This paper makes two key contributions to this research area. First, it shows that throughflow, the total energy-matter entering or exiting a system component, is a global indicator of the relative contribution of the component to the whole system activity. It is global because it includes the direct and indirect exchanges among community members. Further, throughflow is a special case of Hubbell status as defined in social science. This recognition effectively joins the concepts, enabling ecologists to use and build on the broader centrality research in network science. Second, I characterize the distribution of throughflow in 45 empirically-based trophic ecosystem models. Consistent with expectations, this analysis shows that a small fraction of the system components are responsible for the majority of the system activity. In 73% of the ecosystem models, 20% or less of the nodes generate 80% or more of the total system throughflow. Four or fewer dominant nodes are required to account for 50% of the total system activity. 121 of the 130 dominant nodes in the 45 ecosystem models could be classified as primary producers, dead organic matter, or bacteria. Thus, throughflow centrality indicates the rank power of the ecosystems components and shows the power concentration in the primary production and decomposition cycle. Although these results are specific to ecosystems, these techniques build on flow analysis based on economic input-output analysis. Therefore these results should be useful for ecosystem ecology, industrial ecology, the study of urban metabolism, as well as other domains using input-output analysis.",12,['physics'],10

1207.4145,q-bio,"Haplotypes, the global patterns of DNA sequence variation, have important implications for identifying complex traits. Recently, blocks of limited haplotype diversity have been discovered in human chromosomes, intensifying the research on modelling the block structure as well as the transitions or co-occurrence of the alleles in these blocks as a way to compress the variability and infer the associations more robustly. The haplotype block structure analysis is typically complicated by the fact that the phase information for each SNP is missing, i.e., the observed allele pairs are not given in a consistent order across the sequence. The techniques for circumventing this require additional information, such as family data, or a more complex sequencing procedure. In this paper we present a hierarchical statistical model and the associated learning and inference algorithms that simultaneously deal with the allele ambiguity per locus, missing data, block estimation, and the complex trait association. While the blo structure may differ from the structures inferred by other methods, which use the pedigree information or previously known alleles, the parameters we estimate, including the learned block structure and the estimated block transitions per locus, define a good model of variability in the set. The method is completely datadriven and can detect Chron's disease from the SNP data taken from the human chromosome 5q31 with the detection rate of 80% and a small error variance.",12,"['cs', 'stat']",10

Using a crossbridge model with the assumptions of fast powerstroke kinetics and equal load sharing between equivalent states, we derive a one-step master equation for the activity of a finite-sized ensemble of mechanically coupled myosin II motors. For constant external load, this approach yields analytical results for duty ratio and force-velocity relation as a function of ensemble size. We find that stochastic effects cannot be neglected for ensemble sizes below 15.

1211.0974,q-bio,"When mutation rates are low, natural selection remains effective, and increasing the mutation rate can give rise to an increase in adaptation rate. When mutation rates are high to begin with, however, increasing the mutation rate may have a detrimental effect because of the overwhelming presence of deleterious mutations. Indeed, if mutation rates are high enough: 1) adaptation rate can become negative despite the continued availability of adaptive and/or compensatory mutations, or 2) natural selection may be disabled because adaptive and/or compensatory mutations -- whether established or newly-arising -- are eroded by excessive mutation and decline in frequency. We apply these two criteria to a standard model of asexual adaptive evolution and derive mathematical expressions -- some new, some old in new guise -- delineating the mutation rates under which either adaptive evolution or natural selection is neutralized. The expressions are simple and require no \empha priori knowledge of organism- and/or environment-specific parameters.

1206.6768,q-bio,"Selective sweeps are typically associated with a local reduction of genetic diversity around the adaptive site. However, selective sweeps can also quickly carry neutral mutations to observable population frequencies if they arise early in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection coefficient of the sweep. Based on this result, we develop an estimator for the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the novel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on preexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination. Compared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the size of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator requires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth in order to capture low-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms standard approaches. We investigate analytically and numerically how the accuracy of our estimator is affected by the decay of the sweep pattern over time as a consequence of random genetic drift and discuss potential effects of recombination, soft sweeps, and demography. As an example for its use, we apply our estimator to deep sequencing data from HIV populations.",12,[],10

1201.0739,q-bio,"The detection of sound begins when energy derived from acoustic stimuli deflects the hair bundles atop hair cells. As hair bundles move, the viscous friction between stereocilia and the surrounding liquid poses a fundamental challenge to the ear's high sensitivity and sharp frequency selectivity. Part of the solution to this problem lies in the active process that uses energy for frequency-selective sound amplification. Here we demonstrate that a complementary part involves the fluid-structure interaction between the liquid within the hair bundle and the stereocilia. Using force measurement on a dynamically scaled model, finite-element analysis, analytical estimation of hydrodynamic forces, stochastic simulation and high-resolution interferometric measurement of hair bundles, we characterize the origin and magnitude of the forces between individual stereocilia during small hair-bundle deflections. We find that the close apposition of stereocilia effectively immobilizes the liquid between them, which reduces the drag and suppresses the relative squeezing but not the sliding mode of stereociliary motion. The obliquely oriented tip links couple the mechanotransduction channels to this least dissipative coherent mode, whereas the elastic horizontal top connectors stabilize the structure, further reducing the drag. As measured from the distortion products associated with channel gating at physiological stimulation amplitudes of tens of nanometres, the balance of forces in a hair bundle permits a relative mode of motion between adjacent stereocilia that encompasses only a fraction of a nanometre. A combination of high-resolution experiments and detailed numerical modelling of fluid-structure interactions reveals the physical principles behind the basic structural features of hair bundles and shows quantitatively how these organelles are adapted to the needs of sensitive mechanotransduction.",12,['physics'],10

This article, the first in two parts, explores novel applications of weak measurement. We first revisit the basic principles of quantum measurement with the aid of the Michelson interferometer. Weak measurement is then introduced in a simple visualized manner by a specific choice of the reflecting mirror's position and momentum uncertainties. Having introduced the method, we proceed to its refinement for a single particle. We consider a photon going back and forth inside the interferometer, oscillating between a superposed and a localized state, while subjected to alternating strong and weak measurements. This cyclic process enables directly measuring both the photon's position (""which-path"") and momentum (interference), without disturbing either. An alternative explanation of this result, not invoking weak values, is thoroughly considered and shown to be at odds with the experimental data. Finally a practical application of this experiment is demonstrated, where a single photon measures the various transmission coefficients of a multiport beam-splitter yet remains superposed. This method is then generalized to measurement of the wave-function itself, performed again on a single particle.",12,[],6

We show that classical simulations employing a finite amount of communication can be derived from a special class of hidden variable theories where quantum states represent statistical knowledge about the classical state and not an element of reality. This special class has attracted strong interest very recently. The communication cost of each derived simulation is given by the mutual information between the quantum state and the classical state of the parent hidden variable theory.

The second kind are equation degenerate dark states on pairs of sites connected by a fibre. By manipulating intensities and phases of control lasers on the cavities, one can pass adiabatically among these dark states due to their degeneracy. This network operates as a equation-level quantum system in which one can generate computationally useful states by protocols of external controls.

1202.2798,quant-ph,"For a two-qubit system under local depolarizing channels, the most robust and most fragile states are derived for a given concurrence or negativity. For the one-sided channel, the pure states are proved to be the most robust ones, with the aid of the evolution equation for entanglement given by Konrad et al. [Nat. Phys. 4, 99 (2008)]. Based on a generalization of the evolution equation for entanglement, we classify the ansatz states in our investigation by the amount of robustness, and consequently derive the most fragile states. For the two-sided channel, the pure states are the most robust for a fixed concurrence. Under the uniform channel, the most fragile states have the minimal negativity when the concurrence is given in the region [1/2,1]. For a given negativity, the most robust states are the ones with the maximal concurrence, and the most fragile ones are the pure states with minimum of concurrence. When the entanglement approaches zero, the most fragile states under general nonuniform channels tend to the ones in the uniform channel. Influences on robustness by entanglement, degree of mixture, and asymmetry between the two qubits are discussed through numerical calculations. It turns out that the concurrence and negativity are major factors for the robustness. When they are fixed, the impact of the mixedness becomes obvious.

Lett. 106, 140502 (2011)], focusing on an implementation based on solid-state spin systems. The scheme amplifies a quantum sensor response to weak external fields by exploiting its coupling to spin impurities in the environment. We analyze the limits to the sensitivity due to decoherence and propose dynamical decoupling schemes to increase the spin coherence time. The sensitivity is also limited by the environment spin polarization; therefore we discuss strategies to polarize the environment spins and present a method to extend the scheme to the case of zero polarization. The coherence time and polarization determine a figure of merit for the environment's ability to enhance the sensitivity compared to echo-based sensing schemes. This figure of merit can be used to engineer optimized samples for high-sensitivity nanoscale magnetic sensing, such as diamond nanocrystals with controlled impurity density.",12,[],6
1201.0200,quant-ph,"The communication capacity of Gaussian bosonic channels with memory has recently attracted much interest. Here, we investigate a method to prepare the multimode entangled input symbol states for encoding classical information into these channels. In particular, we study the usefulness of a Gaussian matrix product state (GMPS) as an input symbol state, which can be sequentially generated although it remains heavily entangled for an arbitrary number of modes. We show that the GMPS can achieve more than 99.9% of the Gaussian capacity for Gaussian bosonic memory channels with a Markovian or non-Markovian correlated noise model in a large range of noise correlation strengths. Furthermore, we present a noise class for which the GMPS is the exact optimal input symbol state of the corresponding channel. Since GMPS are ground states of particular quadratic Hamiltonians, our results suggest a possible link between the theory of quantum communication channels and quantum many-body physics.",12,[],6

1210.6371,quant-ph,"The transition from classical to quantum mechanics rests on the recognition that the structure of information is not what we thought it was: there are operational, i.e., phenomenal, probabilistic correlations that lie outside the polytope of local correlations. Such correlations cannot be simulated with classical resources, which generate classical correlations represented by the points in a simplex, where the vertices of the simplex represent joint deterministic states that are the common causes of the correlations. The `no go' hidden variable theorems tell us that we can't shoe-horn correlations outside the local polytope into a classical simplex by supposing that something has been left out of the story. The replacement of the classical simplex by the quantum convex set as the structure representing probabilistic correlations is the analogue for quantum mechanics of the replacement of Newton's Euclidean space and time by Minkowski spacetime in special relativity. The nonclassical features of quantum mechanics, including the irreducible information loss on measurement, are generic features of correlations that lie outside the local correlation polytope. This paper is an elaboration of these ideas, and its consequences for the measurement problem of quantum mechanics. A large part of the difficulty is removed by seeing that the inconsistency in reconciling the entangled state at the end of a quantum measurement process with the definiteness of the macroscopic pointer reading and the definiteness of the correlated value of the measured micro-observable is only apparent and depends on a stipulation that is not required by the structure of the quantum possibility space. Replacing this stipulation by an alternative consistent stipulation resolves the problem.",12,[],6

We consider general translation non-invariant systems made of several particle species and derive certain regularity properties that need to be satisfied by the variational parameters. We also devote a section to the translation invariant setting in the thermodynamic limit and show how continuous matrix product states possess an intrinsic ultraviolet cutoff. Finally, we introduce a new set of states which are tangent to the original set of continuous matrix product states. For the case of matrix product states, this construction has recently proven relevant in the development of new algorithms for studying time evolution and elementary excitations of quantum spin chains.

We explore various properties of these entropies, including data-processing inequalities, chain rules and their classical limits. The most important property is an entropic formulation of the asymptotic equipartition property, which implies that the smooth entropies converge to the von Neumann entropy in the limit of many independent copies. The smooth entropies also satisfy duality and entropic uncertainty relations that provide limits on the power of two different observers to predict the outcome of a measurement on a quantum system.   Finally, we discuss three example applications of the smooth entropy framework.

Furthermore, the concept of quantum speed efficiency is introduced as measure of the system resources directly spent on the motion in the projective Hilbert space.

The exclusion principle is robust against noise. Such principle also holds for arbitrary number of parties. This exclusion principle is independent of the content and distribution of entanglement in the multipartite state. We also find a strict monogamy relation for multi-port classical capacities of multi-party quantum states in arbitrary dimensions.

Remarkably, we are able to prove that irreversibility can be understood as typical without assuming decoherence or restricting to coarse-grained observables, and hence occurs under distinct conditions and time-scales than those implied by the usual decoherence point of view.

To this aim we provide a detailed investigation of the dynamics of an atomic system placed close to a body of arbitrary geometry and dielectric permittivity, whose temperature equation is different from that of the surrounding walls equation. A suitable master equation for the general case of an equation-level atom is first derived and then specialized to the cases of a two- and three-level atom. Transition rates and steady states are explicitly expressed as a function of the scattering matrices of the body and become both qualitatively and quantitatively different from the case of radiation at thermal equilibrium. Out of equilibrium, the system steady state depends on the system-body distance, on the geometry of the body and on the interplay of all such parameters with the body optical resonances. While a two-level atom tends toward a thermal state, this is not the case already in the presence of three atomic levels. This peculiar behavior can be exploited, for example, to invert the populations ordering and to provide an efficient cooling mechanism for the internal state of the quantum system.

We argue that this kind of splitting is common to all the phases with a certain group theoretic structure, including quantum double models, cluster states, and other quantum spin liquids.

1212.5933,quant-ph,"The problem of identifying measurement scenarios capable of revealing state-independent contextuality in a given Hilbert space dimension is considered. We begin by showing that for any given dimension equation and any measurement scenario consisting of projective measurements, (i) the measure of contextuality of a quantum state is entirely determined by its spectrum, so that pure and maximally mixed states represent the two extremes of contextual behavior, and that (ii) state-independent contextuality is equivalent to the contextuality of the maximally mixed state up to a global unitary transformation. We then derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a measurement scenario represented by an orthogonality graph to reveal state-independent contextuality. This condition is given in terms of the fractional chromatic number of the graph equation and is shown to identify all state-independent contextual measurement scenarios including those that go beyond the original Kochen-Specker paradigm \citeYu-Oh.",12,[],6
