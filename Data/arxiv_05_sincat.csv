astro-ph/0504278,astro-ph,"Recent hard X-ray surveys have proven to be effective in discovering large numbers of X-ray sources that, despite the likely association with active nuclei, appear to be characterized by ""peculiar"" properties. Among these ""exotic"" source populations, we will focus on the nature of two classes of hard X-ray sources: those characterized by high X-ray-to-optical flux ratios -- a fraction of these are associated with the rather elusive Type 2 quasars -- and the X-ray bright optically normal galaxies, also known as XBONGs.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0502284,astro-ph,"We present a method for studying the proximity effect and the density structure around redshift z=2-3 quasars. It is based on the probability distribution of Lyman-alpha pixel optical depths and its evolution with redshift.   We validate the method using mock spectra obtained from hydrodynamical simulations, and then apply it to a sample of 12 bright quasars at redshifts 2-3 observed with UVES at the VLT-UT2 Kueyen ESO telescope. These quasars do not show signatures of associated absorption and have a mean monochromatic luminosity of 5.4 1031 h-2 erg/s/Hz at the Lyman limit. The observed distribution of optical depth within 10 Mpc/h from the QSO is statistically different from that measured in the general intergalactic medium at the same redshift. Such a change will result from the combined effects of the increase in photoionisation rate above the mean UV-background due to the extra ionizing photons from the quasar radiation (proximity effect), and the higher density of the IGM if the quasars reside in overdense regions (as expected from biased galaxy formation). The first factor decreases the optical depth whereas the second one increases the optical depth, but our measurement cannot distinguish a high background from a low overdensity. An overdensity of the order of a few is required if we use the amplitude of the UV-background inferred from the mean Lyman-equation opacity. If no overdensity is present, then we require the UV-background to be higher, and consistent with the existing measurements based on standard analysis of the proximity effect.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0511018,astro-ph,"Modelling the flow in a thin accretion disc like a dynamical system, we analyse the nature of the critical points of the steady solutions of the flow. For the simple inviscid disc there are two critical points, with the outer one being a saddle point and the inner one a centre type point. For the weakly viscous disc, there are four possible critical points, of which the outermost is a saddle point, while the next inner one is a spiral. Coupling the nature of the critical points with the outer boundary condition of the flow, gives us a complete understanding of all the important physical features of the flow solutions in the subsonic regions of the disc. In the inviscid disc, the physical realisability of the transonic solution passing through the saddle point is addressed by considering a temporal evolution of the flow, which is a very likely non-perturbative mechanism for selecting the transonic inflow solution from among a host of other possible stable solutions. For the weakly viscous disc, while a linearised time-dependent perturbation imposed on the steady mass inflow rate causes instability, the same perturbative analysis reveals that for the inviscid disc, there is a very close correspondence between the equation for the propagation of the perturbation and the metric of an acoustic black hole. Compatible with the transport of angular momentum to the outer regions of the disc, a viscosity-limited length scale is defined for the spatial extent of the inward rotational drift of matter.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0506299,astro-ph,"We study the Frequency Resolved Spectra of the Seyfert galaxy MCG -6-30-15 obtained during two recent XMM-Newton observations. Splitting the Fourier spectra in soft (<2 keV) and hard (>2 keV) bands, we find that the soft band has a variability amplitude larger than the hard one on time scales longer than 10 ksec, while the opposite is true on time scales shorter than 3 ksec. Both the soft and hard band spectra are well fitted by power laws of different indices. The spectra of the hard band become clearly softer as the Fourier Frequency decreases from 7x10-4 Hz to 10-5 Hz, while the spectral slope of the soft band power law component is independent of the Fourier frequency. The well known broad Fe Ka feature is absent at all frequency bins; this result implies that this feature is not variable on time scales shorter than ~105 sec, in agreement with recent line variability studies. Strong spectral features are also present in the soft X-ray band (at E~0.7), clearly discernible in all Fourier Frequency bins. This fact is consistent with the assumption that they are due to absorption by intervening matter within the source.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0512617,astro-ph,"HH 110 and HH 262 are two Herbig-Haro jets with rather peculiar, chaotic morphology. In the two cases, no source suitable to power the jet has been detected along the outflow, at optical or radio wavelengths. Both, previous data and theoretical models, suggest that these objects are tracing an early stage of an HH jet/dense cloud interaction. We present the first results of the integral field spectroscopy observations made with the PMAS spectrophotometer (with the PPAK configuration) of these two turbulent jets. New data of the kinematics in several characteristic HH emission lines are shown. In addition, line-ratio maps have been made, suitable to explore the spatial excitation an density conditions of the jets as a function of their kinematics.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0510084,astro-ph,"The INTEGRAL observatory has been performing a deep survey of the Galactic central radian since 2003, with the goal of both extracting a catalog of sources and gaining insight into the Galactic diffuse emission. This paper concentrates on the estimation of the total point sources emission contribution. It is now clear that unresolved point sources contribute to the observed diffuse emission; the increasing sensitivity of instruments with time has lead to a steady decrease in estimates of this 'diffuse emission'.   We have analysed the first year data obtained with the spectrometer and imager SPI on board INTEGRAL. First, a catalog of 63 hard X-ray sources detected, time-averaged, during our 2003 Galactic plane survey, is derived. Second, after extracting the spectra of the sources detected by SPI, their combined contribution is compared to the total (resolved and unresolved) emission from the Galactic ridge. The data analysis is complex: it requires us to split the total emission into several components, as discrete sources and diffuse emission are superimposed in SPI data. The main result is that point source emission dominates in the hard X-ray/soft equation-ray domain, and contributes around 90 % of the total emission around 100 keV, while above 250 keV, diffuse electron-positron annihilation, through its three-photon positronium continuum with a positronium fraction equation 0.97 and the 511 keV electron-positron line, dominates over the sources.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0508142,astro-ph,"Ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays passing through the central region of the Galaxy interact with starlight and the infrared photons. Both nuclei and protons generate secondary fluxes of photons and neutrinos on their passage through the central region. We compute the fluxes of these secondary particles, the observations of which can be used to improve one's understanding of origin and composition of ultrahigh-energy comic rays, especially if the violation of the Greisen--Zatespin--Kuzmin cutoff is confirmed by the future data.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0507297,astro-ph,"We propose that the anomalously bright white dwarf luminosity function observed in NGC 6791 (Bedin et al 2005) is the consequence of the formation of 0.5 Msun white dwarfs with Helium cores instead of Carbon cores. This may happen if mass loss during the ascent of the Red Giant Branch is strong enough to prevent a star from reaching the Helium flash. Such a model can explain the slower white dwarf cooling (relative to standard models) and fits naturally with scenarios advanced to explain Extreme Horizontal Branch stars, a population of which are also found in this cluster.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0511450,astro-ph,"Gamma ray bursts (GRBs) belong to the most energetic events in the Universe. Recently, the extragalactic nature of these sources has been confirmed with the discovery of several host galaxies (HGs) and the measurement of their redshifts. To explain the origin of GRBs various models have been proposed, among which the coalescence of compact objects and the ""collapsar"" scenarios are the most representative, being the collapsar model one of the most accepted to explain the long duration GRBs. A natural consequence of this model is that the GRBs would trace the star formation rate (SFR) of their HGs. In this contributed paper we present preliminary results of the development of a Montecarlo-based code for collapsar event formation which is coupled to chemical-cosmological simulations aiming at studying the properties of HGs in a hierarchical scenario.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0508296,astro-ph,"Measurements of ellipticities of background galaxies are sensitive to the reduced shear, the cosmic shear divided by equation where equation is the projected density field. We compute the difference between shear and reduced shear both analytically and with simulations. The difference becomes more important on smaller scales, and will impact cosmological parameter estimation from upcoming experiments. A simple recipe is presented to carry out the required correction.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0501467,astro-ph,"We construct hydrogen atmosphere models for strongly magnetized neutron stars in thermodynamic equilibrium, taking into account partial ionization. The presence of bound states affects the equation of state, absorption coefficients, and polarizability tensor of a strongly magnetized plasma. Therefore the partial ionization influences the polarization vectors and opacities of normal electromagnetic waves, and thus the spectra of outgoing radiation. Here we review a model suitable for the most typical neutron-star atmospheres and focus on the problems that remain to be solved for its extension to other atmospheric parameters.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0503262,astro-ph,"Using Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate photopion production from Fermi-accelerated protons and the resulting neutrino production in gamma-ray bursts. Unless internal shocks occur at quite large distance from the center, ultra high-energy protons are depleted by photopion production and synchrotron radiation. Internal shocks at fiducial distance cause neutrino bursts, which accompany gamma-ray bursts originating from electromagnetic cascades.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0510075,astro-ph,"We develop a model based on 3D mean-field MHD for the generation of large scale magnetic fields in fully convective objects like low-mass stars, brown dwarfs and possibly gaseous planets. The dynamo process is of alpha2 type and thus differs from the shell-dynamo at work in more massive stars.The alpha2 dynamo becomes supercritical for Rossby numbers Ro\la 10. It generates a large-scale, non-axisymmetric, steady field that is symmetric with respect to the equatorial plane. Saturation of the alpha2-generated field at the equipartition yields strengths of several kGauss, in agreement with observations of active M dwarfs, and provides a qualitative explanation for the observed activity saturation in late M stars. For brown dwarfs with a conductive core, as occurs at the center of the most massive and oldest of these objects, we have also studied an alpha2-Omega dynamo, i.e. the effect of differential rotation. In this case the field is predominantly toroidal, axisymmetric and oscillatory, like the solar field. The topology of the field in the fully convective objects exhibits a high order multipole character that differs from the aligned dipole field generated by the alpha-Omega dynamo. The strong reduction of the dipolar component due to the field non-axisymmetry should considerably reduce the Alfven radius and thus the efficiency of magnetic braking, providing an appealing explanation for the decreasing angular momentum loss rate observed in low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. This may have also implications for cataclysmic variables below the period gap. In spite of this large-scale field, the decreasing conductivity in the dominantly neutral atmosphere of these objects prevents the current generation necessary to support a chromosphere and thus activity.

astro-ph/0511291,astro-ph,"Various galaxy properties are not continuous over a large range in mass, but rather reveal a remarkable transition or `bimodality' at a stellar mass of 3 x 1010 Mo. These properties include colors, stellar populations, Xray emission and mass-to-light ratios. This behavior has been interpreted as the transition from hot to cold flows by Dekel & Birnboim (2005).   Here we explore whether globular cluster (GC) systems also reveal a bimodal nature with regard to this critical mass scale. Globular clusters probe star formation at early epochs in the Universe and survive subsequent galaxy mergers and accretions. We use new data from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey (Peng etal 2005), which provides a homogeneous sample of the GC systems around one hundred Virgo early-type galaxies covering a range of five hundred in galaxy mass. Their classification of the GC color distributions is taken to examine a key quantity -- the number of GCs per unit galaxy luminosity. Below the critical mass, this quantity (called the GC specific frequency) increases dramatically in its mean value and spread. This increase may be due to regulated star formation in low mass galaxies, which in turn is due to mass loss via winds and the transition from hot to cold gas accretion flows. We also note that above the critical mass, galaxies possess two GC subpopulations (with blue and red mean colors) but below this mass, galaxies reveal an increasing proportion of single (blue) GC systems.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0503603,astro-ph,"This paper and its companion form an extended version of notes provided to participants in the Valencia September 2004 summer school on Data Analysis in Cosmology. The papers offer a pedagogical introduction to the problem of estimating the power spectrum from galaxy surveys. The intention is to focus on concepts rather than on technical detail, but enough mathematics is provided to point the student in the right direction.   This first paper presents background material. It collects some essential definitions, discusses traditional methods for measuring power, notably the Feldman-Kaiser-Peacock (1994) method, and introduces Bayesian analysis, Fisher matrices, and maximum likelihood. For pedagogy and brevity, several derivations are set as exercises for the reader. At the summer school, multiple choice questions, included herein, were used to convey some didactic ideas, and provoked a little lively debate.",2005,[],5

astro-ph/0501112,astro-ph,"Starting from a neutron star heating mechanism by the magnetic dipole radiation from the 3P2 neutron superfluid vortices in neutron stars, we propose a neutron phase oscillation model which describes the phase transition between the normal neutron Fermi fluid and the 3P2 neutron superfluid vortices at the transition temperature of Ttrans=(5-6)\times 108 K. With this model, we can give qualitative explanation to most of the pulsar glitches observed up to date.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0510085,astro-ph,"We present archive ESO VLT photometric and spectroscopic data of the Ultraluminous X-ray source NGC 1313 X-2. The superb quality of the VLT images reveals that two distinct objects, with R magnitudes 23.7 and 23.6, are visible inside the Chandra error box. The two objects, separated by 0.75 arcsec, were unresolved in our previous ESO 3.6 mEFOSC image. We show that both are stars in NGC 1313, the first a B0-O9 main sequence star of ~20 Msun, while the second a G supergiant of ~10 Msun. Irrespectively of which of the two objects the actual counterpart is, this implies that NGC 1313 X-2 is a high mass X-ray binary with a very massive donor.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0509293,astro-ph,"We determine the age distribution of star clusters in the Antennae galaxies (NGC 4038/9) for two mass-limited samples (M > 3 x 104 M\odot and M > 2 x 105 M\odot). This is based on integrated broadband UBVI and narrowband H-alpha photometry from deep images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. We find that the age distribution of the clusters declines steeply, approximately as dN/dletter \propto letter-1. The median age of the clusters is ~107 yr, which we interpret as evidence for rapid disruption (""infant mortality""). It is very likely that most of the young clusters are not gravitationally bound and were disrupted near the times they formed by the energy and momentum input from young stars to the interstellar matter of the protoclusters. At least 20% and possibly all stars form in clusters and/or associations, including those that are unbound and short-lived.",2005,[],5

astro-ph/0501397,astro-ph,"We present the results of a detailed spectral analysis of optically faint hard X-ray sources in the Chandra deep fields selected on the basis of their high X-ray to optical flux ratio (X/O). The stacked spectra of high X/O sources in both Chandra deep fields, fitted with a single power-law model, are much harder than the spectrum of the X-ray background (XRB). The average slope is also insensitive to the 2-8 keV flux, being approximately constant around Gamma~1 over more than two decades, strongly indicating that high X/O sources represent the most obscured component of the XRB. For about half of the sample, a redshift estimate (in most of the cases a photometric redshift) is available from the literature. Individual fits of a few of the brightest objects and of stacked spectra in different redshift bins imply column densities in the range 1022-23.5 cm-2. A trend of increasing absorption towards higher redshifts is suggested.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0509384,astro-ph,"We perform an analytical study and a Monte Carlo (MC) analysis of the main features for microlensing events in pixel lensing observations towards M31. Our main aim is to investigate the lens nature and location of the 14 candidate events found by the MEGA collaboration. Assuming a reference model for the mass distribution in M31 and the standard model for our galaxy, we estimate the MACHO-to-self lensing probability and the event time duration towards M31. Reproducing the MEGA observing conditions, as a result we get the MC event number density distribution as a function of the event full-width half-maximum duration equation and the magnitude at maximum equation. For a MACHO mass of equation we find typical values of equation day and equation, for both MACHO-lensing and self-lensing events occurring beyond about 10 arcminutes from the M31 center. A comparison of the observed features (equation and equation) with our MC results shows that for a MACHO mass equation the four innermost MEGA events are most likely self-lensing events, whereas the six outermost events must be genuine MACHO-lensing events.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0511521,astro-ph,We compute the linear responses of the Hubble diagram to small scalar perturbations in the Robertson-Walker metric and to small peculiar velocities of emitter and receiver.

astro-ph/0504212,astro-ph,"We discuss atmosphere models of HD209458b in light of the recent day-side flux measurement of HD209458b's secondary eclipse by Spitzer-MIPS at 24 microns. In addition, we present a revised secondary eclipse IRTF upper limit at 2.2 microns which places a stringent constraint on the adjacent H2O absorption band depths. These two measurements are complementary because they are both shaped by H2O absorption and because the former is on the Wien tail of the planet's thermal emission spectrum and the latter is near the thermal emission peak. A wide range of models fit the observational data, confirming our basic understanding of hot Jupiter atmospheric physics. Although a range of models are viable, some models at the hot and cold end of the plausible temperature range can be ruled out. One class of previously unconsidered hot Jupiter atmospheric models that fit the data are those with C/O >~ 1 (as Jupiter may have), which have a significant paucity of H2O compared to solar abundance models with C/O = 0.5. The models indicate that HD209458b is in a situation intermediate between pure in situ reradiation and very efficient redistribution of heat; one which will require a careful treatment of atmospheric circulation. We discuss how future wavelength-dependent and phase-dependent observations will further constrain the atmospheric circulation regime. In the shorter term, additional planned measurements for HD209458b, especially Spitzer IRAC photometry, should lift many of the model degeneracies. Multiwavelength IR observations constrain the atmospheric structure and circulation properties of hot Jupiters and thus open a new chapter in quantitative extrasolar planetology.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0507587,astro-ph,"We combine data from our recent FUSE survey of interstellar molecular hydrogen absorption toward 50 high-latitude AGN with COBE-corrected IRAS 100 micron emission maps to study the correlation of infrared cirrus with H2. A plot of the H2 column density vs. IR cirrus intensity shows the same transition in molecular fraction, fH2, as seen with total hydrogen column density, NH. This transition is usually attributed to H2 self-shielding, and it suggests that many diffuse cirrus clouds contain H2 in significant fractions, fH2 = 1-30%. These clouds cover approximately 50% of the northern sky at latitudes b > 30 degrees, at temperature-corrected 100 micron intensities D100 > 1.5 MJy/sr. The sheetlike cirrus clouds, with hydrogen densities nH > 30 cm-3, may be compressed by dynamical processes at the disk-halo interface, and they are conducive to H2 formation on grain surfaces. Exploiting the correlation between N(H2) and 100 micron intensity, we estimate that cirrus clouds at b > 30 contain approximately 3000 Msun in H2. Extrapolated over the inner Milky Way, the cirrus may contain 107 Msun of H2 and 108 Msun in total gas mass. If elevated to 100 pc, their gravitational potential energy is ~1053 erg.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0502283,astro-ph,"In this letter, we discuss generation of magnetic field from cosmological perturbations. We consider the evolution of three component plasma (electron, proton and photon) evaluating the collision term between elecrons and photons up to the second order. The collision term is shown to induce electric current, which then generate magnetic field. There are three contributions, two of which can be evaluated from the first-order quantities, while the other one is fluid vorticity which is purely second order. We estimate the magnitudes of the former contributions and shows that the amplitude of the produced magnetic field is about equation at 10Mpc comoving scale at the recombination. Compared to astrophysical and inflationary mechanisms for seed-field generation, our study suffers from much less ambiguities concerning unknown physics and/or processes.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0503266,astro-ph,"We analyze and interpret SOHO/MDI data on oscillation frequency changes between 1996 and 2004 focusing on differences between activity minimum and maximum of solar cycle 23. We study only the behavior of the centroid frequencies, which reflect changes averaged over spherical surfaces. Both the f-mode and p-mode frequencies are correlated with general measures of the sun's magnetic activity. However, the physics behind each of the two correlations is quite different. We show that for the f-modes the dominant cause of the frequency increase is the dynamical effect of the rising magnetic field. The relevant rise must occur in subphotospheric layers reaching to some 0.5 - 0.7 kG at a depth of about 5 Mm. However, the implied constraints also require the field change in the atmosphere to be so small that it has only a tiny dynamical effect on p-mode frequencies. For p-modes, the most plausible explanation of the frequency increase is a less than 2 percent decrease in the radial component of the turbulent velocity in the outer layers. Lower velocity implies a lower efficiency of the convective transport, hence lower temperature, which also contributes to the p-mode frequency increase.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0501507,astro-ph,"We report the discovery of a high-energy transient with the IBIS/ISGRI detector on board the INTEGRAL observatory. The source, namely IGR J002915934, was first detected on 2nd December 2004 in the routine monitoring of the IBIS/ISGRI 20--60 keV images. The observations were conducted during Galactic Plane Scans, which are a key part of the INTEGRAL Core Programme observations. After verifying the basic source behaviour, the discovery was announced on 3rd December. The transient shows a hard Comptonised spectrum, with peak energy release at about 20 keV and a total luminosity of ~ 0.9E36 erg/s in the 5--100 keV range, assuming a distance of 3 kpc. Following the INTEGRAL announcement of the discovery of IGR J002915934, a number of observations were made by other instruments.

astro-ph/0506341,astro-ph,"We present a detailed analysis of XMM archival data of two Ultraluminous X-ray Sources (ULXs) in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 1313: NGC 1313 X-1 and X-2. The spectral continuum of these sources was modeled with a soft thermal component plus a power-law. If the soft component originates from an accretion disk, the inferred mass of the compact remnant is > 100 Msun, making it an Intermediate Mass Black Hole (IMBH). A detailed analysis of the residuals of the XMM EPIC-pn spectrum shows some evidence for the presence of an Oxygen emission line in NGC 1313 X-1. The simultaneous presence of an excess in emission, although at a much reduced significance level, at different energies in the X-ray spectra of NGC 1313 X-1 and X-2 is suggestive of typical emission lines from young supernova remnants. An optical counterpart for NGC 1313 X-2 was also identified.

astro-ph/0507361,astro-ph,"We investigate the luminosity dependence of quasar clustering, inspired by numerical simulations of galaxy mergers that incorporate black hole growth. These simulations have motivated a new interpretation of the quasar luminosity function. In this picture, the bright end of the quasar luminosity function consists of quasars radiating nearly at their peak luminosities, while the faint end consists mainly of very similar sources, but at dimmer phases in their evolution. We combine this model with the statistics of dark matter halos that host quasar activity. We find that, since bright and faint quasars are mostly similar sources seen in different evolutionary stages, a broad range in quasar luminosities corresponds to only a narrow range in the masses of quasar host halos. On average, bright and faint quasars reside in similar host halos. Consequently, we argue that quasar clustering should depend only weakly on luminosity. This prediction is in qualitative agreement with recent measurements of the luminosity dependence of the quasar correlation function (Croom et al. 2005) and the galaxy-quasar cross-correlation function (Adelberger & Steidel 2005). Future precision clustering measurements from SDSS and 2dF, spanning a large range in luminosity, should provide a strong test of our model.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0509608,astro-ph,"We derive the transverse flux correlation function in the Lyman-alpha forest at z~2.1 from VLT-FORS observations of a total of 32 pairs of quasars. The shape and correlation length of the transverse correlation function are in good agreement with the paradigm of intergalactic medium predicted in CDM-like models for structures formation. Using a sample of 139 Civ systems detected along the lines of sight toward the pairs of quasars we investigate the transverse correlation of metals on the same scales. We find that the correlation function is consistent with that of a randomly distributed population of Civ systems.

astro-ph/0502278,astro-ph,"We present a 39 h integration with the Odin satellite on the ground-state 118.75 GHz line of O2 towards the region of strongest molecular emission in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Our 3sigma upper limit to the O2 integrated intensity of <0.049 K km/s in a 9'(160 pc) diameter beam corresponds to an upper limit on the O2/H2 abundance ratio of <1.3E-6. Although a factor of 20 above the best limit on the O2 abundance obtained for a Galactic source, our result has interesting implications for understanding oxygen chemistry at sub-solar metal abundances. We compare our abundance limit to a variety of astrochemical models and find that, at low metallicities, the low O2 abundance is most likely produced by the effects of photo-dissociation on molecular cloud structure. Freeze-out of molecules onto dust grains may also be consistent with the observed abundance limit, although such models have not yet been run at sub-solar initial metallicities.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0504536,astro-ph,"Perhaps as many as 30 parallax microlensing events are known, thanks to the efforts of the MACHO, OGLE, EROS and MOA experiments monitoring the bulge. Using Galactic models, we construct mock catalogues of microlensing light curves towards the bulge, allowing for the uneven sampling and observational error bars of the OGLE-II experiment. The fraction of parallax events with delta chi2 > 50 in the OGLE-II database is around ~1%, though higher fractions are reported by some other surveys. This is in accord with expectations from standard Galactic models. The fraction of parallax events depends strongly on the Einstein crossing time (tE), being less than 5% at tE = 50 days but rising to 50% at tE > 1 yr. We find that the existence of parallax signatures is essentially controlled by the acceleration of the observer normalised to the projected Einstein radius on the observer plane divided by tE2. The properties of the parallax events - time-scales, projected velocities, source and lens locations - in our mock catalogues are analysed. Typically, ~38% of parallax events are caused by a disk star microlensing a bulge source, while \~33% are caused by a disk star microlensing a disk source (of these disk sources, one sixth are at a distance of 5 kpc or less). There is a significant shift in mean time-scale from 32 d for all events to ~130d for our parallax events. There are corresponding shifts for other parameters, such as the lens-source velocity projected onto the observer plane (~1110 km/s for all events versus ~80 km/s for parallax events) and the lens distance (6.7 kpc versus 3.7 kpc). We also assess the performance of parallax mass estimators and investigate whether our mock catalogue can reproduce events with features similar to a number of conjectured `black hole' lens candidates.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0506547,astro-ph,"We analyze the angular distribution and the orbital rotation directions of a sample of carefully-selected satellite galaxies extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We also study these statistics in an N-body simulation of cosmological structure formation set within the LCDM paradigm under various assumptions for the orientations of disk angular momenta. Assuming that the angular momenta of the disks are aligned with the angular momenta of the inner regions of their host dark matter halos, we find that the fraction of simulated satellite halos that exhibit prograde motion is 0.55-0.60, with larger satellites more likely to be prograde. In our observational sample, approximately 60% of the satellites exhibit prograde motion, a result that is broadly consistent with the simulated sample. Contrary to several recent studies, our observational sample of satellite galaxies show no evidence for being anisotropically distributed about their primary disks. Again, this result is broadly consistent with our simulated sample of satellites under the assumption that disk and halo angular momenta are aligned. However, the small size of our observational sample does not yet allow us to distinguish between various assumptions regarding the orientations of disks in their halos. Finally, we assessed the importance of contamination by interlopers on the measured prograde and retrograde statistics.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0509030,astro-ph,"From 1979--1996 the Green Bank Interferometer was used by the Naval Research Laboratory to monitor the flux density from 146 compact radio sources at frequencies near 2 and 8 GHz. We filter the 'light curves' to separate intrinsic variations on times of a year or more from more rapid interstellar scintilation (ISS) on times of 5--50 d. Whereas the intrinsic variation at 2 GHz is similar to that at 8 GHz (though diminished in amplitude), the ISS variation is much stronger at 2 than at 8 GHz. We characterize the ISS variation by an rms amplitude and a timescale and examine the statistics of these parameters for the 121 sources with significant ISS at 2 GHz. We model the scintillations using the NE2001 Galactic electron model assuming the sources are brightness-limited.   We find the observed rms amplitude to be in general agreement with the model, provided that the compact components of the sources have about 50% of their flux density in a component with maximum brightness temperatures equation--equationK. Thus our results are consistent with cm-wavelength VLBI studies of compact AGNs, in that the maximum brightness temperatures found are consistent with the inverse synchrotron limit at equation K, boosted in jet configurations by Doppler factors up to about 20. The average of the observed 2 GHz ISS timescales is in reasonable agreement with the model at Galactic latitudes above about 10\de. At lower latitudes the observed timescales are too fast, suggesting that the transverse plasma velocity increases more than expected beyond about 1 kpc.",2005,[],5
astro-ph/0512647,astro-ph,"We have made a comparative study of morphological evolution in simulated DM halos and X-ray brightness distribution, and in optical clusters. Samples of simulated clusters include star formation with supernovae feedback, radiative cooling, and simulation in the adiabatic limit at three different redshifts, z = 0.0, 0.10, and 0.25. The optical sample contains 208 ACO clusters within redshift, equation. Cluster morphology, within 0.5 and 1.0 hequation Mpc from cluster center, is quantified by multiplicity and ellipticity.   We find that the distribution of the dark matter halos in the adiabatic simulation appear to be more elongated than the galaxy clusters. Radiative cooling brings halo shapes in excellent agreement with observed clusters, however, cooling along with feedback mechanism make the halos more flattened.   Our results indicate relatively stronger structural evolution and more clumpy distributions in observed clusters than in the structure of simulated clusters, and slower increase in simulated cluster shapes compared to those in the observed one.   Within equation, we notice an interesting agreement in the shapes of clusters obtained from the cooling simulations and observation. We also notice that the different samples of observed clusters differ significantly in morphological evolution with redshift. We highlight a few possibilities responsible for the discrepancy in morphological evolution of simulated and observed clusters.",2005,[],5

We find that masers of all molecular species surveyed trace a wide variety of phenomena and show a proclivity for linear distributions. The vast majority of these linear distributions can be explained by outflows or shocks, and in general do not appear to trace circumstellar disks as was previously thought.

astro-ph/0509563,astro-ph,"We measure the matter power spectrum from the Lyman-alpha forest of 31 quasar spectra spanning the redshift range of 1.6-3.6. The optical depth, equation, for absorption of the intergalactic medium is obtained from the flux using the inversion method of Nusser & Haehnelt (1999). The optical depth is converted to density by using a simple power law relation, equation. The non-linear 1D power spectrum of the gas density is then inferred with a method that makes simultaneous use of the 1 and 2 point statistics of the flux and compared against theoretical models with a likelihood analysis. A Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model with standard cosmological parameters fits the data well. The power spectrum amplitude is measured to be (assuming a flat Universe), equation, with equation varying in the range of equation with redshift. Enforcing the same cosmological parameters in all four redshift bins, the likelihood analysis suggests some evolution in the density-temperature relation and the thermal smoothing length of the gas. The inferred evolution is consistent with that expected if reionization of \hep occurred at equation. A joint analysis with the WMAP results together with a prior on the Hubble constant as suggested by the HST key project data, yields values of equation and equation that are consistent with the cosmological concordance model.

gr-qc/0505050,gr-qc,"Several results of black holes thermodynamics can be considered as firmly founded and formulated in a very general manner. From this starting point we analyse in which way these results may give us the opportunity to gain a better understanding in the thermodynamics of ordinary systems for which a pre-relativistic description is sufficient. First, we investigated the possibility to introduce an alternative definition of the entropy basically related to a local definition of the order in a spacetime model rather than a counting of microstates. We show that such an alternative approach exists and leads to the traditional results provided an equilibrium condition is assumed. This condition introduces a relation between a time interval and the reverse of the temperature. We show that such a relation extensively used in the black hole theory, mainly as a mathematical trick, has a very general and physical meaning here; in particular its derivation is not related to the existence of a canonical density matrix. Our dynamical approach of thermodynamic equilibrium allows us to establish a relation between action and entropy and we show that an identical relation exists in the case of black holes. The derivation of such a relation seems impossible in the Gibbs ensemble approach of statistical thermodynamics. From these results we suggest that the definition of entropy in terms of order in spacetime should be more general that the Boltzmann one based on a counting of microstates. Finally we point out that these results are obtained by reversing the traditional route going from the Schrodinger equation to statistical thermodynamics.",2005,[],4

In the low-part of its frequency band, the LISA strain sensitivity will be dominated by the incoherent superposition of hundreds of millions of gravitational wave signals radiated by inspiraling white-dwarf binaries present in our own galaxy. In order to estimate the magnitude of the LISA response to this background, we have simulated a synthesized population that recently appeared in the literature. We find the amplitude of the galactic white-dwarf binary background in the LISA data to be modulated in time, reaching a minimum equal to about twice that of the LISA noise for a period of about two months around the time when the Sun-LISA direction is roughly oriented towards the Autumn equinox. Since the galactic white-dwarfs background will be observed by LISA not as a stationary but rather as a cyclostationary random process with a period of one year, we summarize the theory of cyclostationary random processes, present the corresponding generalized spectral method needed to characterize such process, and make a comparison between our analytic results and those obtained by applying our method to the simulated data. We find that, by measuring the generalized spectral components of the white-dwarf background, LISA will be able to infer properties of the distribution of the white-dwarfs binary systems present in our Galaxy.",2005,[],4

This review can serve as a self-contained introduction to loop quantum gravity and related areas. Our intent is to make the paper accessible to a wider audience that may include topologists, knot-theorists, and other persons innocent of the physical background to this approach to quantum gravity.",2005,[],6
hep-th/0502231,hep-th,"A d-dimensional rational polytope P is a polytope whose vertices are located at the nodes of d-dimensional Z-lattice. Consider a number of points inside the inflated polytope (with coefficient of inflation k, k=1,2, 3...). The Ehrhart polynomial of P counts the number of such lattice points (nodes) inside the inflated P and (may be) at its faces (including vertices). In Part I (hep-th/0410242) of our four parts work we noticed that the Veneziano amplitude is just the Laplace transform of the generating function (considered as a partition function in the sence of statistical mechanics) for the Ehrhart polynomial for the regular inflated simplex obtained as a deformation retract of the Fermat (hyper) surface living in complex projective space. This observation is sufficient for development of new symplectic (this work) and supersymmetric (hep-th/0411241)physical models reproducing the Veneziano (and Veneziano-like) amplitudes. General ideas (e.g.those related to the properties of Ehrhart polynomials) are illustrated by simple practical examples (e.g. use of mirror symmetry for explanation of available experimental data on pion-pion scattering) worked out in some detail. Obtained final results are in formal accord with those earlier obtained by Vergne [PNAS 93 (1996) 14238].",2005,[],6
hep-th/0502162,hep-th,"We describe the construction of new locally asymptotically (A)dS geometries with relevance for the AdS/CFT and dS/CFT correspondences. Our approach is to obtain new solutions by analytically continuing black hole solutions. A basic consideration of the method of continuation indicates that these solutions come in three classes: S-branes, bubbles and anti-bubbles. A generalization to spinning or twisted solutions can yield spacetimes with complicated horizon structures. Interestingly enough, several of these spacetimes are nonsingular.",2005,[],6
hep-th/0505152,hep-th,A string theory description of near extremal black rings is proposed. The entropy is computed and the thermodynamic properties are derived for a large family of black rings that have not yet been constructed in supergravity. It is also argued that the most general black ring in N=8 supergravity has 21 parameters up to duality.,2005,[],6
hep-th/0503114,hep-th,"Global aspects of Scherk-Schwarz dimensional reduction are discussed and it is shown that it can usually be viewed as arising from a compactification on the compact space obtained by identifying a (possibly non-compact) group manifold G under a discrete subgroup Gamma, followed by a truncation. This allows a generalisation of Scherk-Schwarz reductions to string theory or M-theory as compactifications on G/Gamma, but only in those cases in which there is a suitable discrete subgroup of G. We analyse such compactifications with flux and investigate the gauge symmetry and its spontaneous breaking. We discuss the covariance under O(d,d), where d is the dimension of the group G, and the relation to reductions with duality twists. The compactified theories promote a subgroup of the O(d,d) that would arise from a toroidal reduction to a gauge symmetry, and we discuss the interplay between the gauge symmetry and the O(d,d,Z) T-duality group, suggesting the role that T-duality should play in such compactifications.",2005,[],6
hep-th/0504102,hep-th,"We conjecture chronology is protected in string theory due to the condensation of light winding strings near closed null curves. This condensation triggers a Hagedorn phase transition, whose end-point target space geometry should be chronological. Contrary to conventional arguments, chronology is protected by an infrared effect. We support this conjecture by studying strings in the O-plane orbifold, where we show that some winding string states are unstable and condense in the non-causal region of spacetime. The one-loop string partition function has infrared divergences associated to the condensation of these states.",2005,[],6
hep-th/0512152,hep-th,"We discuss the structure of the dressed fermion propagator in unquenched QED3 based on spectral function of photon.In this approximation infrared divergences that appeared in quenched case turns out to be soft.The dimension full coupling constant naturally appears as an infrared mass scale in this case.We find the reliable results for the effects of vacuum polarization for the dressed fermion propagator.The lowest order fermion spectral function has logarithmically divergent Coulomb energy as well as self-energy,whch plays the role of confinement and dynamical mass generation.In our model finiteness condition of vacuum expectation value is equivalent to choose the scale of physical mass which is expected in the 1/N approximation.",2005,[],6
hep-th/0501213,hep-th,"We obtain the pp-waves of D=5 and D=4 gauged supergravities supported by equation and equation gauge field strengths respectively. We show that generically these solutions preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetry, but supernumerary supersymmetry can arise for appropriately constrained harmonic functions associated with the pp-waves. In particular it implies that the solutions are independent of the light-cone coordinate equation. We also obtain the pp-waves in the Freedman-Schwarz model.",2005,[],6
hep-th/0509178,hep-th,"It has been argued that certain reduced actions play a role in AdS/CFT when comparing fast moving strings to long single trace operators in gauge theories. Such actions arise in two ways: as a limit of the string action and as a description of long single trace field theory operators. They are non-relativistic sigma models with the target space usually being a Kahler manifold. They are non-renormalizable and need a cut-off in the wave-length. If the total spin (or charge) contained in a minimal wavelength is large compared to one, the system behaves approximately classically and an expansion in loops is meaningful.   In this paper we apply the renormalization group procedure to such actions and find, at one-loop, that the Kahler potential flows in the infrared to a Kahler-Einstein one.Therefore, in this context, the anomalous dimensions of long operators are determined by a fixed point. This suggests that certain features of the large N-limit might be independent of the detailed properties of a gauge theory.",2005,[],6
hep-th/0505230,hep-th,"For supersymmetric spacetimes in eleven dimensions admitting a null Killing spinor, a set of explicit necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of any number of arbitrary additional Killing spinors is derived. The necessary and sufficient conditions are comprised of algebraic relationships, linear in the spinorial components, between the spinorial components and their first derivatives, and the components of the spin connection and four-form. The integrability conditions for the Killing spinor equation are also analysed in detail, to determine which components of the field equations are implied by arbitrary additional supersymmetries and the four-form Bianchi identity. This provides a complete formalism for the systematic and exhaustive investigation of all spacetimes with extended null supersymmetry in eleven dimensions. The formalism is employed to show that the general bosonic solution of eleven dimensional supergravity admitting a equation structure defined by four Killing spinors is either locally the direct product of equation with a seven-manifold of equation holonomy, or locally the Freund-Rubin direct product of equation with a seven-manifold of weak equation holonomy. In addition, all supersymmetric spacetimes admitting a equation structure are classified.",2005,[],6
hep-th/0506230,hep-th,"We show that Calabi-Yau crystals generate certain Chern-Simons knot invariants, with Lagrangian brane insertions generating the unknot and Hopf link invariants. Further, we make the connection of the crystal brane amplitudes to the topological vertex formulation explicit and show that the crystal naturally resums the corresponding topological vertex amplitudes. We also discuss the conifold and double wall crystal model in this context. The results suggest that the free energy associated to the crystal brane amplitudes can be simply expressed as a target space Gopakumar-Vafa expansion.",2005,[],6
hep-th/0505240,hep-th,"We identify the obstructions for T-dualizing the boundary WZW model and make explicit how they depend on the geometry of branes. In particular, the obstructions disappear for certain brane configurations associated to non-regular elements of the Cartan torus. It is shown in this case that the boundary WZW model is ""nested"" in the twisted boundary WZW model as the dynamical subsystem of the latter.",2005,[],6
hep-th/0507075,hep-th,"We study large-N double-scaling limits of U(N) gauge theories in four dimensions. We focus on theories in a partially confining phase where an abelian subgroup equation of the gauge group remains unconfined. Double-scaling is defined near critical points in the parameter/moduli space where states charged under equation become massless. In specific cases, we present evidence that the double-scaled theory is dual to a non-critical superstring background. Models studied include the equation-deformation of equation SUSY Yang-Mills which leads to a non-critical string theory with sixteen supercharges. We also study equation SUSY Yang-Mills theory coupled to a single chiral superfield with a polynomial superpotential which leads to a related string theory with eight supercharges. In both cases the string coupling is small and the background is free from Ramond-Ramond flux.",2005,[],6
hep-th/0505140,hep-th,"We find non-critical string backgrounds in five and eight dimensions, holographically related to four-dimensional conformal field theories with N=0 and N=1 supersymmetries. In the five-dimensional case we find an AdS5 background metric for a string model related to non-supersymmetric, conformal QCD with large number of colors and flavors and discuss the conjectured existence of a conformal window from the point of view of our solution. In the eight-dimensional string theory, we build a family of solutions of the form AdS5 x \tildeS3 with \tildeS3 a squashed three-sphere. For a special value of the ratio Nf/Nc, the background can be interpreted as the supersymmetric near-horizon limit of a system of color and flavor branes on R1,3 times a known four-dimensional generalization of the cigar. The N=1 dual theory with fundamental matter should have an IR fixed point only for a fixed ratio Nf/Nc. General features of the string/gauge theory correspondence for theories with fundamental flavors are also addressed.",2005,[],6
hep-th/0510060,hep-th,"I derive a procedure to count chiral primary states in N=1 superconformal field theories in four dimensions. The chiral primaries are counted by putting the N=1 field theory on S3 X R. I also define an index that counts semi-short multiplets of the superconformal theory. I construct N=1 supersymmetric Lagrangians on S3 X R for theories which are believed to flow to a conformal fixed point in the IR. For ungauged theories I reduce the field theory to a supersymmetric quantum mechanics, whereas for gauge theories I use chiral ring arguments. I count chiral primaries for SU(2) SYM with three flavors and its Seiberg dual. Those two results agree provided a new chiral ring relation holds.",2005,[],6

The fundamental role of two-dimensional free massless pseudo-scalar fields is revealed for this procedure together with their locality condition taken into account. Thus the better insight into solvability of this model is obtained together with the additional phase factor for its general solution, and the meaning of the Schwinger terms is elucidated.",2005,[],6
hep-th/0510250,hep-th,"5-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory with Chern-Simons coefficient equation has supersymmetric black holes with vanishing horizon angular velocity, but finite angular momentum. Here supersymmetry is associated with a borderline between stability and instability, since for equation a rotational instability arises, where counterrotating black holes appear, whose horizon rotates in the opposite sense to the angular momentum. For equation black holes are no longer uniquely characterized by their global charges, and rotating black holes with vanishing angular momentum appear.",2005,[],6

hep-th/0506103,hep-th,"It is argued that the massive gauge field theory without the Higgs mechanism can well be set up on the gauge-invariance principle based on the viewpoint that a massive gauge field must be viewed as a constrained system and the Lorentz condition, as a constraint, must be introduced from the beginning and imposed on the Yang-Mills Lagrangian. The quantum theory for the massive gauge fieldis may perfectly be established by the quantization performed in the Hamiltonian or the Lagrangian path-integral formalism by means of the Lagrange undetermined multiplier method and shows good renormalizability and unitarity.",2005,[],6

All calculations are printed in much detail and with explicit comments as to how they were done. Also contained is a simple approach to Clifford algebras to prepare the grounds for the harder calculations in spin space and Fierz identities.",2005,[],6
hep-th/0507074,hep-th,"It is shown that the Lagrangian reduction, in which solutions of equations of motion that do not involve time derivatives are used to eliminate variables, leads to results quite different from the standard Dirac treatment of the first order form of the Einstein-Hilbert action when the equations of motion correspond to the first class constraints. A form of the first order formulation of the Einstein-Hilbert action which is more suitable for the Dirac approach to constrained systems is presented. The Dirac and reduced approaches are compared and contrasted. This general discussion is illustrated by a simple model in which all constraints and the gauge transformations which correspond to first class constraints are completely worked out using both methods in order to demonstrate explicitly their differences. These results show an inconsistency in the previous treatment of the first order Einstein-Hilbert action which is likely responsible for problems with its canonical quantization.",2005,[],6
hep-th/0512020,hep-th,"In order to produce a low energy effective field theory from a string model, it is necessary to specify a vacuum state. In order that this vacuum be supersymmetric, it is well known that all field expectation values must be along so-called flat directions, leaving the F- and D-terms of the scalar potential to be zero. The situation becomes particularly interesting when one attempts to realize such directions while assigning VEVS to fields transforming under non-Abelian representations of the gauge group. Since the expectation value is now shared among multiple components of a field, satisfaction of flatness becomes an inherently geometrical problem in the group space. Furthermore, the possibility emerges that a single seemingly dangerous F-term might experience a self-cancellation among its components. The hope exists that the geometric language can provide an intuitive and immediate recognition of when the D and F conditions are simultaneously compatible, as well as a powerful tool for their comprehensive classification. This is the avenue explored in this paper, and applied to the cases of SU(2) and SO(2N), relevant respectively to previous attempts at reproducing the MSSM and the flipped SU(5) GUT. Geometrical interpretation of non-Abelian flat directions finds application to M-theory through the recent conjecture of equivalence between D-term strings and wrapped D-branes of Type II theory. Knowledge of the geometry of the flat direction ""landscape"" of a D-term string model could yield information about the dual brane model. It is hoped that the techniques encountered will be of benefit in extending the viability of the quasi-realistic phenomenologies already developed.",2005,[],6
hep-th/0507060,hep-th,"In this paper, we investigate the influence of gravity and noncommutativity on Dirac equation. By adopting the tetrad formalism, we show that the modified Dirac equation keeps the same form. The only modification is in the expression of the covariant derivative. The new form of this derivative is the product of its counterpart given in curved space-time with an operator which depends on the noncommutative equation-parameter. As an application, we have computed the density number of the created particles in presence of constant strong electric field in an anisotropic Bianchi universe.",2005,[],6
hep-th/0511009,hep-th,The formulation of gravity and M-theories as very-extended Kac-Moody invariant theories is reviewed. Exact solutions describing intersecting extremal brane configurations smeared in all directions but one are presented.

hep-th/0508183,hep-th,"We continue the program initiated in hep-th/0411200 and calculate the algebra of the flat currents for the string on AdS5 x S5 background in the light-cone gauge with kappa-symmetry fixed. We find that the algebra has a closed form and that the non-ultralocal terms come with a weight factor eletter that depends on the radial AdS5 coordinate. Based on results in two-dimensional sigma models coupled to gravity via the dilaton field, this suggests that the algebra of transition matrices in the present case is likely to be unambigous.",2005,[],6
hep-th/0507177,hep-th,"A general discussion of the conformal Ward identities is presented in the context of logarithmic conformal field theory with conformal Jordan cells of rank two. The logarithmic fields are taken to be quasi-primary. No simplifying assumptions are made about the operator-product expansions of the primary or logarithmic fields. Based on a very natural and general ansatz about the form of the two- and three-point functions, their complete solutions are worked out. The results are in accordance with and extend the known results. It is demonstrated, for example, that the correlators exhibit hierarchical structures similar to the ones found in the literature pertaining to certain simplifying assumptions.",2005,[],6

We present an alternative method to calculate this value.",2005,[],6
hep-th/0510162,hep-th,"A rigorous three-dimensional relativistic equation for quark-antiquark bound states at finite temperature is derived from the thermal QCD generating functional which is formulated in the coherent-state representation. The generating functional is derived newly and given a correct path-integral expression. The perturbative expansion of the generating functional is specifically given by means of the stationary-phase method. Especially, the interaction kernel in the three-dimensional equation is derived by virtue of the equations of motion satisfied by some quark-antiquark Green functions and given in a closed form which is expressed in terms of only a few types of Green functions. This kernel is much suitable to use for exploring the deconfinement of quarks. To demonstrate the applicability of the equation derived, the one-gluon exchange kernel is derived and described in detail.",2005,[],6

hep-th/0502192,hep-th,"We have proposed a generally covariant non-relativistic particle model that can represent the equation-Minkowski noncommutative spacetime. The idea is similar in spirit to the noncommutative particle coordinates in the lowest Landau level. Physically our model yields a novel type of dynamical system, (termed here as Exotic ""Oscillator""), that obeys a   Harmonic Oscillator like equation of motion with a \itfrequency that is proportional to the square root of \itenergy. On the other hand, the phase diagram does not reveal a closed structure since there is a singularity in the momentum even though energy remains finite. The generally covariant form is related to a generalization of the Snyder algebra in a specific gauge and yields the equation-Minkowski spacetime after a redefinition of the variables. Symmetry considerations are also briefly discussed in the Hamiltonian formulation. Regarding continuous symmetry, the angular momentum acts properly as the generator of rotation. Interestingly, both the discrete symmetries, parity and time reversal, remain intact in the equation-Minkowski spacetime.",2005,[],6

With help of a change of variables followed by a change of wave function, two redundant degrees of freedom get eliminated and the mass-shell constraints can be reduced to a three-dimensional eigenvalue problem.   In general, this problem is complicated, but for three equal masses a drastic simplification arises at the first post-Galilean order: the reduced wave equation becomes tractable, and we can compute a first-order correction beyond the nonrelativistic limit. The harmonic interaction is displayed as a toy model.",2005,[],6

hep-th/0506152,hep-th,"Extending the analysis of hep-th/0504128, we obtain a formal expression for the coupling between brane matter and the radion in a Randall-Sundrum braneworld. This effective theory is correct to all orders in derivatives of the radion in the limit of small brane separation, and, in particular, contains no higher than second derivatives. In the case of cosmological symmetry the theory can be obtained in closed form and reproduces the five-dimensional behaviour. Perturbations in the tensor and scalar sectors are then studied. When the branes are moving, the effective Newtonian constant on the brane is shown to depend both on the distance between the branes and on their velocity. In the small distance limit, we compute the exact dependence between the four-dimensional and the five-dimensional Newtonian constants.",2005,[],6
hep-th/0503121,hep-th,"We show that string theory in AdS3 has two distinct phases depending on the radius of curvature RAdS=\sqrtkls. For k>1 (i.e. RAdS>ls), the SL(2,C) invariant vacuum of the spacetime conformal field theory is normalizable, the high energy density of states is given by the Cardy formula with ceff=c, and generic high energy states look like large BTZ black holes. For k<1, the SL(2,C) invariant vacuum as well as BTZ black holes are non-normalizable, ceff<c, and high energy states correspond to long strings that extend to the boundary of AdS3 and become more and more weakly coupled there. A similar picture is found in asymptotically linear dilaton spacetime with dilaton gradient Q=\sqrt2/k. The entropy grows linearly with the energy in this case (for k>\half). The states responsible for this growth are two dimensional black holes for k>1, and highly excited perturbative strings living in the linear dilaton throat for k<1. The change of behavior at k=1 in the two cases is an example of a string/black hole transition. The entropies of black holes and strings coincide at k=1.",2005,[],6
