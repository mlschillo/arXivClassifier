1603.04057,astro-ph,"A prediction of the standard LCDM cosmology is that dark matter (DM) halos are teeming with numerous self-bound substructure, or subhalos. The precise properties of these subhalos represent important probes of the underlying cosmological model. We use data from Via Lactea II and ELVIS N-body simulations to learn about the structure of subhalos with masses 1e6 - 1e11 Msun/h. Thanks to a superb subhalo statistics, we study subhalo properties as a function of distance to host halo center and subhalo mass, and provide a set of fits that accurately describe the subhalo structure. We also investigate the role of subhalos on the search for DM annihilation. Previous work has shown that subhalos are expected to boost the DM signal of their host halos significantly. Yet, these works traditionally assumed that subhalos exhibit similar structural properties than those of field halos, while it is known that subhalos are more concentrated. Building upon our N-body data analysis, we refine the substructure boost model of Sanchez-Conde & Prada (2014), and find boosts that are a factor 2-3 higher. We further refine the model to include unavoidable tidal stripping effects on the subhalo population. For field halos, this introduces a moderate 20-30% suppression. Yet, for subhalos like those hosting dwarf galaxy satellites, tidal stripping plays a critical role, the boost being at the level of a few tens of percent at most. We provide a parametrization of the boost for field halos that can be safely applied over a wide halo mass range.",16,[],1
1612.00116,astro-ph,"[abridged] In large-scale time-domain surveys, the processing of data, from procurement up to the detection of sources, is generally automated. One of the main challenges is contamination by artifacts, especially in regions of strong unresolved emission. We present a novel method for identifying candidates for variables and transients from the outputs of such surveys' data pipelines. We use the method to systematically search for novae in iPTF observations of the bulge of M31. We demonstrate that most artifacts produced by the iPTF pipeline form a locally uniform background of false detections approximately obeying Poissonian statistics, whereas genuine variables and transients as well as artifacts associated with bright stars result in clusters of detections, whose spread is determined by the source localization accuracy. This makes the problem analogous to source detection on images produced by X-ray telescopes, enabling one to utilize tools developed in X-ray astronomy. In particular, we use a wavelet-based source detection algorithm from the Chandra data analysis package CIAO. Starting from ~2.5x105 raw detections made by the iPTF data pipeline, we obtain ~4000 unique source candidates. Cross-matching these candidates with the source-catalog of a deep reference image, we find counterparts for ~90% of them. These are either artifacts due to imperfect PSF matching or genuine variable sources. The remaining ~400 detections are transient sources. We identify novae among these candidates by applying selection cuts based on the expected properties of nova lightcurves. Thus, we recovered all 12 known novae registered during the time span of the survey and discovered three nova candidates. Our method is generic and can be applied for mining any target out of the artifacts in optical time-domain data. As it is fully automated, its incompleteness can be accurately computed and corrected for.",16,[],1
1603.08991,astro-ph,"We present an analysis of the relative throughputs of the 3.9-metre Anglo-Australian Telescope's 2dF/HERMES system, based upon spectra acquired during the first two years of the GALAH survey. Averaged spectral fluxes of stars were compared to their photometry to determine the relative throughputs of fibres for a range of fibre position and atmospheric conditions. We find that overall the throughputs of the 771 usable fibres have been stable over the first two years of its operation. About 2.5 per cent of fibres have throughputs much lower than the average. There are also a number of yet unexplained variations between the HERMES bandpasses, and mechanically & optically linked fibre groups known as retractors or slitlets related to regions of the focal plane. These findings do not impact the science that HERMES will produce.",16,[],1
1602.01468,astro-ph,"The recent discoveries of Swift J164457 and J205805 show that tidal disruption events (TDEs) can launch relativistic jets. Super-Eddington accretion produces a strong radiation field of order Eddington luminosity. In a jetted TDE, electrons in the jet will inverse-Compton scatter the external radiation field from the accretion disk and wind. Motivated by observations of thermal optical-UV spectra in Swift J205805 and several other TDEs, we assume the spectrum of the external radiation field intercepted by the relativistic jet to be blackbody. Hot electrons in the jet scatter this thermal radiation and produce luminosities 1045-1048 erg/s in the X/gamma-ray band.   This model of thermal plus inverse-Compton radiation is applied to Swift J205805. First, we show that the blackbody component in the optical-UV spectrum most likely has its origin in the super-Eddington wind from the disk. Then, using the observed blackbody component as the external radiation field, we show that the X-ray luminosity and spectrum are consistent with the inverse-Compton emission, under the following conditions: (1) the jet Lorentz factor is ~5-10; (2) electrons in the jet have a powerlaw distribution with minimum Lorentz factor ~1 and powerlaw index p = 2.4; (3) the wind is mildly relativistic (Lorentz factor >~1.5) and has isotropic-equivalent mass-loss rate ~5 Msun/yr. We describe the implications for jet composition and the radius where jet energy is converted to radiation.",16,[],1
1607.08387,astro-ph,"We report the first identification of forbidden line components from an element heavier than helium in the spectrum of astrophysical plasmas. As yet, these components were identified only in laboratory plasmas and not in astrophysical objects. Forbidden components are well known for neutral helium lines in hot stars, particularly in helium-rich post-AGB stars and white dwarfs. We discovered that two hitherto unidentified lines in the ultraviolet spectra of hot hydrogen-deficient (pre-) white dwarfs can be identified as forbidden line components of triply ionized carbon (C IV). The forbidden components (3p-4f and 3d-4d) appear in the blue and red wings of the strong, Stark broadened 3p-4d and 3d-4f lines at 1108 Angstroem and 1169 Angstroem, respectively. They are visible over a wide effective temperature range (60,000-200,000 K) in helium-rich (DO) white dwarfs and PG1159 stars that have strongly oversolar carbon abundances.",16,[],1
1607.03577,astro-ph,"We use the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope to study the rich population of young massive star clusters in the main body of NGC 3256, a merging pair of galaxies with a high star formation rate (SFR) and SFR per unit area (equation). These clusters have luminosity and mass functions that follow power laws, equation with equation, and equation with equation for equation Myr clusters, similar to those found in more quiescent galaxies. The age distribution can be described by equation, with equation for clusters younger than about a few hundred million years, with no obvious dependence on cluster mass. This is consistent with a picture where equation of the clusters are disrupted each decade in time. We investigate the claim that galaxies with high equation form clusters more efficiently than quiescent systems by determining the fraction of stars in bound clusters (equation) and the CMF/SFR statistic (CMF is the cluster mass function) for NGC 3256 and comparing the results with those for other galaxies. We find that the CMF/SFR statistic for NGC 3256 agrees well with that found for galaxies with equation and SFRs that are lower by equation orders of magnitude, but that estimates for equation are only robust when the same sets of assumptions are applied. Currently, equation values available in the literature have used different sets of assumptions, making it more difficult to compare the results between galaxies.",16,[],1
1603.00025,astro-ph,"We know that planetary systems are just as common around white dwarfs as around main sequence stars. However, self-consistently linking a planetary system across these two phases of stellar evolution through the violent giant branch poses computational challenges, and previous studies restricted architectures to equal-mass planets. Here, we remove this constraint and perform over 450 numerical integrations over a Hubble time (14 Gyr) of packed planetary systems with unequal-mass planets. We characterize the resulting trends as a function of planet order and mass. We find that intrusive radial incursions in the vicinity of the white dwarf become less likely as the dispersion amongst planet masses increases. The orbital meandering which may sustain a sufficiently dynamic environment around a white dwarf to explain observations is more dependent on the presence of terrestrial-mass planets than any variation in planetary mass. Triggering unpacking or instability during the white dwarf phase is comparably easy for systems of unequal-mass planets and systems of equal-mass planets; instabilities during the giant branch phase remain rare and require fine-tuning of initial conditions. We list the key dynamical features of each simulation individually as a potential guide for upcoming discoveries.",16,[],1
1603.09339,astro-ph,"We present evidence from the RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) survey of chemically separated, kinematically distinct disc components in the solar neighbourhood. We apply probabilistic chemical selection criteria to separate our sample into equation-low (`thin disc') and equation-high (`thick disc') sequences. Using newly derived distances, which will be utilized in the upcoming RAVE DR5, we explore the kinematic trends as a function of metallicity for each of the disc components. For our equation-low disc, we find a negative trend in the mean rotational velocity (equation) as a function of iron abundance ([Fe/H]). We measure a positive gradient equation/equation[Fe/H] for the equation-high disc, consistent with results from high-resolution surveys. We also find differences between the equation-low and equation-high discs in all three components of velocity dispersion. We discuss the implications of an equation-low, metal-rich population originating from the inner Galaxy, where the orbits of these stars have been significantly altered by radial mixing mechanisms in order to bring them into the solar neighbourhood. The probabilistic separation we propose can be extended to other data sets for which the accuracy in [equation/Fe] is not sufficient to disentangle the chemical disc components a priori. For such datasets which will also have significant overlap with Gaia DR1, we can therefore make full use of the improved parallax and proper motion data as it becomes available to investigate kinematic trends in these chemical disc components.",16,[],1
1611.02706,astro-ph,"In these proceedings we highlight the primary scientific goals and design of the WEAVE-LOFAR survey, which will use the new WEAVE spectrograph on the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope to provide the primary source of spectroscopic information for the LOFAR Surveys Key Science Project. Beginning in 2018, WEAVE-LOFAR will generate more than 10equation R=5000 365-960 nm spectra of low-frequency selected radio sources, across three tiers designed to efficiently sample the redshift-luminosity plane, and produce a data set of enormous legacy value. The radio frequency selection, combined with the high multiplex and throughput of the WEAVE spectrograph, make obtaining redshifts in this way very efficient, and we expect that the redshift success rate will approach 100 per cent at equation. This unprecedented spectroscopic sample - which will be complemented by an integral field component - will be transformational in key areas, including studying the star formation history of the Universe, the role of accretion and AGN-driven feedback, properties of the epoch of reionisation, cosmology, cluster haloes and relics, as well as the nature of radio galaxies and protoclusters. Each topic will be addressed in unprecedented detail, and with the most reliable source classifications and redshift information in existence.",16,[],1
1605.05594,astro-ph,"The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) provide information about the surface composition of about 100,000 minor planets. The resulting visible colors and albedos enabled us to group them in several major classes, which are a simplified view of the diversity shown by the few existing spectra. We performed a serendipitous search in VISTA-VHS observations using a pipeline developed to retrieve and process the data that corresponds to solar system objects (SSo). The colors and the magnitudes of the minor planets observed by the VISTA survey are compiled into three catalogs that are available online: the detections catalog (MOVIS-D), the magnitudes catalog (MOVIS-M), and the colors catalog (MOVIS-C). They were built using the third data release of the survey (VISTA VHS-DR3). A total of 39,947 objects were detected, including 52 NEAs, 325 Mars Crossers, 515 Hungaria asteroids, 38,428 main-belt asteroids, 146 Cybele asteroids, 147 Hilda asteroids, 270 Trojans, 13 comets, 12 Kuiper Belt objects and Neptune with its four satellites. The colors found for asteroids with known spectral properties reveal well-defined patterns corresponding to different mineralogies. The distributions of MOVIS-C data in color-color plots shows clusters identified with different taxonomic types. All the diagrams that use (Y-J) color separate the spectral classes more effectively than the (J-H) and (H-Ks) plots used until now: even for large color errors (<0.1), the plots (Y-J) vs (Y-Ks) and (Y-J) vs (J-Ks) provide the separation between S-complex and C-complex. The end members A, D, R, and V-types occupy well-defined regions.",16,[],1
1601.02289,astro-ph,"We present the analysis of hot spot brightness in light curves of the eclipsing dwarf nova IY Ursae Majoris during its normal outburst in March 2013 and in quiescence in April 2012 and in October 2015. Examination of four reconstructed light curves of the hot spot eclipses showed directly that the brightness of the hot spot changed significantly only during the outburst. The brightness of the hot spot, before and after the outburst, was on the same level. Hereby, based on the behaviour of the hot spot, IY UMa during its normal outburst follows the disk-instability model.",16,[],1
1604.04607,astro-ph,"Brown & Mallik 2008 and the Brown et al. 2010 corrigendum of it presented expressions for non-thermal recombination (NTR) in the collisionally thin- and thick-target regimes, claiming that the process could account for a substantial part of hard X-ray continuum in solar flares usually attributed entirely to thermal and non-thermal bremsstrahlung (NTB). However, we have found the thick-target expression to become unphysical for low cut-offs in the injected electron energy spectrum. We trace this to an error in the derivation, derive a corrected version which is real-valued and continuous for all photon energies and cut-offs, and show that, for thick targets, Brown et al. over-estimated NTR emission at small photon energies. The regime of small cut-offs and large spectral indices involve large (reducing) correction factors but in some other thick-target parameter regimes NTR/NTB can still be of order unity. We comment on the importance of these results to flare and to microflare modeling and spectral fitting. An empirical fit to our results shows that the peak NTR contribution comprises over half the hard X-ray signal if delta > 6 (E0c/4 keV)(0.4).",16,[],1
1606.03399,astro-ph,"Forming a three dimensional view of the Universe is a long-standing goal of astronomical observations, and one that becomes increasingly difficult at high redshift. In this paper we discuss how tomography of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at equation can be used to estimate the redshifts of massive galaxies in a large volume of the Universe based on spectra of galaxies in their background. Our method is based on the fact that hierarchical structure formation leads to a strong dependence of the halo density on large-scale environment. A map of the latter can thus be used to refine our knowledge of the redshifts of halos and the galaxies and AGN which they host. We show that tomographic maps of the IGM at a resolution of equationMpc can determine the redshifts of more than 90 per cent of massive galaxies with redshift uncertainty equation. Higher resolution maps allow such redshift estimation for lower mass galaxies and halos.",16,[],1
1610.01599,astro-ph,"We present a simple method to accurately infer line of sight (LOS) integrated lensing effects for galaxy scale strong lens systems through image reconstruction. Our approach enables us to separate weak lensing LOS effects from the main strong lens deflector. We test our method using mock data and show that strong lens systems can be accurate probes of cosmic shear with a precision on the shear terms of equation (statistical error) for an HST-like dataset. We apply our formalism to reconstruct the lens COSMOS 00384133 and its LOS. In addition, we estimate the LOS properties with a halo-rendering estimate based on the COSMOS field galaxies and a galaxy-halo connection. The two approaches are independent and complementary in their information content. We find that when estimating the convergence at the strong lens system, performing a joint analysis improves the measure by a factor of two compared to a halo model only analysis. Furthermore the constraints of the strong lens reconstruction lead to tighter constraints on the halo masses of the LOS galaxies. Joint constraints of multiple strong lens systems may add valuable information to the galaxy-halo connection and may allow independent weak lensing shear measurement calibrations.",16,[],1
1609.01140,astro-ph,"On 2015 January 6-7, an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) was observed at L1. This event, which can be associated with a weak and slow coronal mass ejection, allows us to discuss on the differences between the boundaries of the magnetic cloud and the compositional boundaries. A fast stream from a solar coronal hole surrounding this ICME offers a unique opportunity to check the boundaries' process definition and to explain differences between them. Using Wind and ACE data, we perform a complementary analysis involving compositional, magnetic, and kinematic observations providing relevant information regarding the evolution of the ICME as travelling away from the Sun. We propose erosion, at least at the front boundary of the ICME, as the main reason for the difference between the boundaries, and compositional signatures as the most precise diagnostic tool for the boundaries of ICMEs.",16,[],1

1610.02748,astro-ph,"Small-crater counts on Mars light-toned sedimentary rock are often inconsistent with any isochron; these data are usually plotted then ignored. We show (using an 18-HiRISE-image, >104 crater dataset) that these non-isochron crater counts are often well-fit by a model where crater production is balanced by crater obliteration via steady exhumation. For these regions, we fit erosion rates. We infer that Mars light-toned sedimentary rocks typically erode at ~102 nm/yr, when averaged over 10 km2 scales and 107-108 yr timescales. Crater-based erosion-rate determination is consistent with independent techniques, but can be applied to nearly all light-toned sedimentary rocks on Mars. Erosion is swift enough that radiolysis cannot destroy complex organic matter at some locations (e.g. paleolake deposits at SW Melas), but radiolysis is a severe problem at other locations (e.g. Oxia Planum). The data suggest that the relief of the Valles Marineris mounds is currently being reduced by wind erosion, and that dust production on Mars <3 Gya greatly exceeds the modern reservoir of mobile dust.",16,[],1
1607.01790,astro-ph,"We present a new measurement of the Hubble Constant H0 and other cosmological parameters based on the joint analysis of three multiply-imaged quasar systems with measured gravitational time delays. First, we measure the time delay of HE0435-1223 from 13-year light curves obtained as part of the COSMOGRAIL project. Companion papers detail the modeling of the main deflectors and line of sight effects, and how these data are combined to determine the time-delay distance of HE 0435-1223. Crucially, the measurements are carried out blindly with respect to cosmological parameters in order to avoid confirmation bias. We then combine the time-delay distance of HE0435-1223 with previous measurements from systems B1608656 and RXJ1131-1231 to create a Time Delay Strong Lensing probe (TDSL). In flat equationCDM with free matter and energy density, we find equation = 71.9 2.4 -3.0 km/s/Mpc and equation = 0.62 0.24 -0.35 . This measurement is completely independent of, and in agreement with, the local distance ladder measurements of H0. We explore more general cosmological models combining TDSL with other probes, illustrating its power to break degeneracies inherent to other methods. The TDSL and Planck joint constraints are equation = 69.2 1.4 -2.2 km/s/Mpc, equation = 0.70 0.01 -0.01 and equation = 0.003 0.004 -0.006 in open equationCDM and equation = 79.0 4.4 -4.2 km/s/Mpc, equation = 0.77 0.02 -0.03 and equation = -1.38 0.14 -0.16 in flat equationCDM. Combined with Planck and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data, when relaxing the constraints on the numbers of relativistic species we find equation = 3.34 0.21 -0.21 and when relaxing the total mass of neutrinos we find 0.182 eV. In an open equationCDM in combination with Planck and CMB lensing we find equation = 77.9 5.0 -4.2 km/s/Mpc, equation = 0.77 0.03 -0.03, equation = -0.003 0.004 -0.004 and equation = -1.37 0.18 -0.23.",16,[],1
1612.01745,astro-ph,"We recently presented evidence that stable umbra-penumbra boundaries are characterised by a distinct canonical value of the vertical component of the magnetic field, equation. In order to trigger the formation of a penumbra, large inclinations in the magnetic field are necessary. In sunspots, the penumbra develops and establishes by colonising both umbral areas and granulation, that is, penumbral magneto-convection takes over in umbral regions with equation, as well as in granular convective areas. Eventually, a stable umbra-penumbra boundary settles at equation. Here, we aim to study the development of a penumbra initiated at the boundary of a pore, where the penumbra colonises the entire pore ultimately. We have used Hinode/SOT G-band images to study the evolution of the penumbra. Hinode/SOT spectropolarimetric data were used to infer the magnetic field properties in the studied region. The penumbra forms at the boundary of a pore located close to the polarity inversion line of NOAA\,10960. As the penumbral bright grains protrude into the pore, the magnetic flux in the forming penumbra increases at the expense of the pore magnetic flux. Consequently, the pore disappears completely giving rise to an orphan penumbra. At all times, the vertical component of the magnetic field in the pore is smaller than equation~kG. Our findings are in an agreement with the need of equation for establishing a stable umbra-penumbra boundary: while equation in the pore is smaller than equation, the protrusion of penumbral grains into the pore area is not blocked, a stable pore-penumbra boundary does not establish, and the pore is fully overtaken by the penumbral magneto-convective mode. This scenario could also be one of the mechanisms giving rise to orphan penumbrae.",16,[],1
1606.00140,astro-ph,"We present a multi-wavelength analysis of the host galaxy of short-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) 150101B. Follow-up optical and X-ray observations suggested that the host galaxy, 2MASX J12320498-1056010, likely harbors a low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN). Our modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED) has confirmed the nature of the AGN, making it the first reported GRB host that contains an AGN. We have also found the host galaxy is a massive elliptical galaxy with stellar population of equation, one of the oldest among the short-duration GRB hosts. Our analysis suggests that the host galaxy can be classified as an X-ray bright, optically normal galaxy (XBONG), and the central AGN is likely dominated by a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF). Our work explores interesting connection that may exist between GRB and AGN activities of the host galaxy, which can help understand the host environment of the GRB events and the roles of AGN feedback.",16,[],1
1607.06308,astro-ph,"Solar rotational tomography (SRT) applied to white-light coronal images observed at multiple aspect angles has been the preferred approach for determining the three-dimensional (3D) electron density structure of the solar corona. However, it is seriously hampered by the restrictive assumption that the corona is time-invariant which introduces significant errors in the reconstruction. We first explore several methods to mitigate the temporal variation of the corona by decoupling the ""fast-varying"" inner corona from the ""slow-moving"" outer corona using multiple masking (either by juxtaposition or recursive combination) and radial weighting. Weighting with a radial exponential profile provides some improvement over a classical reconstruction but only beyond 3 Rsun. We next consider a full time-dependent tomographic reconstruction involving spatio-temporal regularization and further introduce a co-rotating regularization aimed at preventing concentration of reconstructed density in the plane of the sky. Crucial to testing our procedure and properly tuning the regularization parameters is the introduction of a time-dependent MHD model of the corona based on observed magnetograms to build a time-series of synthetic images of the corona. Our procedure, which successfully reproduces the time-varying model corona, is finally applied to a set of of 53 LASCO-C2 pB images roughly evenly spaced in time from 15 to 29 March 2009. Our procedure paves the way to a time-dependent tomographic reconstruction of the coronal electron density to the whole set of LASCO-C2 images presently spanning 20 years.",16,[],1
1606.09232,astro-ph,"The equation of state of cold supra-nuclear-density matter, such as in neutron stars, is an open question in astrophysics. A promising method for constraining the neutron star equation of state is modelling pulse profiles of thermonuclear X-ray burst oscillations from hotspots on accreting neutron stars. The pulse profiles, constructed using spherical and oblate neutron star models, are comparable to what would be observed by a next-generation X-ray timing instrument like ASTROSAT, NICER, or LOFT. In this paper, we showcase the use of an evolutionary optimization algorithm to fit pulse profiles to determine the best-fit masses and radii. By fitting synthetic data, we assess how well the optimization algorithm can recover the input parameters. Multiple Poisson realizations of the synthetic pulse profiles, constructed with 1.6 million counts and no background, were fitted with the Ferret algorithm to analyze both statistical and degeneracy-related uncertainty, and to explore how the goodness-of-fit depends on the input parameters. For the regions of parameter space sampled by our tests, the best-determined parameter is the projected velocity of the spot along the observer's line-of-sight, with an accuracy of equation% compared to the true value and with equation\% statistical uncertainty. The next best-determined are the mass and radius; for a neutron star with a spin frequency of 600\,Hz, the best-fit mass and radius are accurate to equation%, with respective uncertainties of equation% and equation%. The accuracy and precision depend on the observer inclination and spot co-latitude, with values of equation % achievable in mass and radius if both the inclination and co-latitude are > 60 degrees.",16,[],1
1608.00048,astro-ph,"As part of the Large Program ASAI (Astrochemical Surveys At IRAM), we have used the IRAM 30m telescope to lead a systematic search for the emission of rotational transitions of P-bearing species between 80 and 350 GHz towards L1157-B1, a shock position in the solar-type star forming region L1157. We report the detection of several transitions of PN and, for the first time, of prebiotic molecule PO. None of these species are detected towards the driving protostar of the outflow L1157-mm. Analysis of the line profiles shows that PN arises from the outflow cavity, where SiO, a strong shock tracer, is produced. Radiative transfer analysis yields an abundance of 2.5e-9 and 0.9e-9 for PO and PN, respectively. These results imply a strong depletion (approx 100) of Phosphorus in the quiescent cloud gas. Shock modelling shows that atomic N plays a major role in the chemistry of PO and PN. The relative abundance of PO and PN brings constraints both on the duration of the pre-shock phase, which has to be about 1 Myr, and on the shock parameters. The maximum temperature in the shock has to be larger than 4000K, which implies a shock velocity of 40 km/s.",16,[],1
1606.07405,astro-ph,"We examine a sample of 1495 galaxies in the CANDELS fields to determine the evolution of two component galaxies, including bulges and discs, within massive galaxies at the epoch 1 < z < 3 when the Hubble sequence forms. We fit all of our galaxies' light profiles with a single S\'ersic fit, as well as with a combination of exponential and S\'ersic profiles. The latter is done in order to describe a galaxy with an inner and an outer component, or bulge and disc component. We develop and use three classification methods (visual, F-test and the RFF) to separate our sample into 1-component galaxies (disc/spheroids-like galaxies) and 2-component galaxies (galaxies formed by an 'inner part' or bulge and an 'outer part' or disc). We then compare the results from using these three different ways to classify our galaxies. We find that the fraction of galaxies selected as 2-component galaxies increases on average 50 per cent from the lowest mass bin to the most massive galaxies, and decreases with redshift by a factor of four from z = 1 to z = 3. We find that single S\'ersic 'disc-like' galaxies have the highest relative number densities at all redshifts, and that 2-component galaxies have the greatest increase and become at par with S\'ersic discs by z = 1. We also find that the systems we classify as 2-component galaxies have an increase in the sizes of their outer components, or 'discs', by about a factor of three from z = 3 to z = 1.5, while the inner components or 'bulges' stay roughly the same size. This suggests that these systems are growing from the inside out, whilst the bulges or protobulges are in place early in the history of these galaxies. This is also seen to a lesser degree in the growth of single 'disc-like' galaxies vs. 'spheroid-like' galaxies over the same epoch.",16,[],1

1611.00376,astro-ph,"We investigate our knowledge of early universe cosmology by exploring how much additional energy density can be placed in different components beyond those in the equationCDM model. To do this we use a method to separate early- and late-universe information enclosed in observational data, thus markedly reducing the model-dependency of the conclusions. We find that the 95\% credibility regions for extra energy components of the early universe at recombination are: non-accelerating additional fluid density parameter equation and extra radiation parameterised as extra effective neutrino species equation when imposing flatness. Our constraints thus show that even when analyzing the data in this largely model-independent way, the possibility of hiding extra energy components beyond equationCDM in the early universe is seriously constrained by current observations. We also find that the standard ruler, the sound horizon at radiation drag, can be well determined in a way that does not depend on late-time Universe assumptions, but depends strongly on early-time physics and in particular on additional components that behave like radiation. We find that the standard ruler length determined in this way is equation Mpc if the radiation and neutrino components are standard, but the uncertainty increases by an order of magnitude when non-standard dark radiation components are allowed, to equation Mpc.",16,[],1
1603.00035,astro-ph,"A sample of 102 local (0.02 < z < 0.1) Seyfert galaxies with black hole masses MBH > 107 Msun was selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and observed using the Keck 10-m telescope to study the scaling relations between MBH and host galaxy properties. We study profile changes of the broad Hbeta emission line within the ~3-9 year time-frame between the two sets of spectra. The variability of the broad Hbeta emission line is of particular interest, not only since it is used to estimate MBH, but also since its strength and width is used to classify Seyfert galaxies into different types. At least some form of broad-line variability (in either width or flux) is observed in the majority (~66%) of the objects, resulting in a Seyfert-type change for ~38% of the objects, likely driven by variable accretion and/or obscuration. The broad Hbeta line virtually disappears in 3/102 (~3%) extreme cases. We discuss potential causes for these changing-look AGNs. While similar dramatic transitions have previously been reported in the literature, either on a case-by-case basis or in larger samples focusing on quasars at higher redshifts, our study provides statistical information on the frequency of Hequation line variability in a sample of low-redshift Seyfert galaxies.",16,[],1
1611.07578,astro-ph,"We develop a statistical estimator to infer the redshift probability distribution of a photometric sample of galaxies from its angular cross-correlation in redshift bins with an overlapping spectroscopic sample. This estimator is a minimum variance weighted quadratic function of the data: a quadratic estimator. This extends and modifies the methodology presented by McQuinn & White (2013). The derived source redshift distribution is degenerate with the source galaxy bias, which must be constrained via additional assumptions. We apply this estimator to constrain source galaxy redshift distributions in the Kilo-Degree imaging survey through cross-correlation with the spectroscopic 2-degree Field Lensing Survey, presenting results first as a binned step-wise distribution in the range z < 0.8, and then building a continuous distribution using a Gaussian process model. We demonstrate the robustness of our methodology using mock catalogues constructed from N-body simulations, and comparisons with other techniques for inferring the redshift distribution.",16,[],1
1603.04656,astro-ph,"To place the highly substructured stellar halos of the Milky Way and M31 in a larger context of hierarchical galaxy formation, it is necessary to understand the prevalence and properties of tidal substructure around external galaxies. This chapter details the current state of our observational knowledge of streams in galaxies in and beyond the Local Group, which are studied both in resolved stellar populations and in integrated light. Modeling of individual streams in extragalactic systems is hampered by our inability to obtain resolved stellar kinematics in the streams, though many streams contain alternate luminous kinematic tracers, such as globular clusters or planetary nebulae. We compare the observed structures to the predictions of models of galactic halo formation, which provide insight in the number and properties of streams expected around Milky Way like galaxies. More specifically, we discuss the inferences that can be made about stream progenitors based only on observed morphologies. We expand our discussion to consider hierarchical accretion at lower mass scales, in particular the observational evidence that substructure exists on smaller mass scales and the effects accretion events may have on the evolution of dwarf galaxies (satellite or isolated). Lastly, we discuss potential correlations between the presence of substructure in the halo and the structural properties of the disk. While many exciting discoveries have been made of tidal substructures around external galaxies, the ""global"" questions of galaxy formation and evolution via hierarchical accretion await a more complete census of the low surface brightness outskirts of galaxies in and beyond the Local Group.",16,[],1
1603.00867,astro-ph,"The ultrafast-rotating (equation) fully convective single M4 dwarf V374 Peg is a well-known laboratory for studying intense stellar activity in a stable magnetic topology. As an observable proxy for the stellar magnetic field, we study the stability of the light curve, and thus the spot configuration. We also measure the occurrence rate of flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We analyse spectroscopic observations, equation photometry covering 5 years, and additional equation photometry that expands the temporal base over 16 years. The light curve suggests an almost rigid-body rotation, and a spot configuration that is stable over about 16 years, confirming the previous indications of a very stable magnetic field. We observed small changes on a nightly timescale, and frequent flaring, including a possible sympathetic flare. The strongest flares seem to be more concentrated around the phase where the light curve indicates a smaller active region. Spectral data suggest a complex CME with falling-back and re-ejected material, with a maximal projected velocity of equation675km/s. We observed a CME rate much lower than expected from extrapolations of the solar flare-CME relation to active stars.",16,[],1
1608.04480,astro-ph,"Context: Debris disks are important observational clues for understanding planetary-system formation process. In particular, faint warm debris disks may be related to late planet formation near 1 AU. A systematic search of faint warm debris disks is necessary to reveal terrestrial planet formation. Aims: Faint warm debris disks show excess emission that peaks at mid-IR wavelengths. Thus we explore debris disks using the AKARI mid-IR all-sky point source catalog (PSC), a product of the second generation unbiased IR all-sky survey. Methods : We investigate IR excess emission for 678 isolated main-sequence stars for which there are 18 micron detections in the AKARI mid-IR all-sky catalog by comparing their fluxes with the predicted fluxes of the photospheres based on optical to near-IR fluxes and model spectra. The near-IR fluxes are first taken from the 2MASS PSC. However, 286 stars with Ks<4.5 in our sample have large flux errors in the 2MASS photometry due to saturation. Thus we have measured accurate J, H, and Ks band fluxes, applying neutral density (ND) filters for Simultaneous InfraRed Imager for Unbiased Survey (SIRIUS) on IRSF, the letter 1.4 m near-IR telescope in South Africa, and improved the flux accuracy from 14% to 1.8% on average. Results: We identified 53 debris-disk candidates including eight new detections from our sample of 678 main-sequence stars. The detection rate of debris disks for this work is ~8%, which is comparable with those in previous works by Spitzer and Herschel. Conclusion: The importance of this study is the detection of faint warm debris disks around nearby field stars. At least nine objects have a large amount of dust for their ages, which cannot be explained by the conventional steady-state collisional cascade model.",16,[],1
1609.01785,astro-ph,"It is generally accepted that silicate-metal (`rocky') planet formation relies on coagulation from a mixture of sub-Mars sized planetary embryos and (smaller) planetesimals that dynamically emerge from the evolving circum-solar disc in the first few million years of our Solar System. Once the planets have, for the most part, assembled after a giant impact phase, they continue to be bombarded by a multitude of planetesimals left over from accretion. Here we place limits on the mass and evolution of these planetesimals based on constraints from the highly siderophile element (HSE) budget of the Moon. Outcomes from a combination of N-body and Monte Carlo simulations of planet formation lead us to four key conclusions about the nature of this early epoch. First, matching the terrestrial to lunar HSE ratio requires either that the late veneer on Earth consisted of a single lunar-size impactor striking the Earth before 4.45 Ga, or that it originated from the impact that created the Moon. An added complication is that analysis of lunar samples indicates the Moon does not preserve convincing evidence for a late veneer like Earth. Second, the expected chondritic veneer component on Mars is 0.06 weight percent. Third, the flux of terrestrial impactors must have been low ( <=10(-6) Mearth/Myr) to avoid wholesale melting of Earth's crust after 4.4~Ga, and to simultaneously match the number of observed lunar basins. This conclusion leads to an Hadean eon which is more clement than assumed previously. Last, after the terrestrial planets had fully formed, the mass in remnant planetesimals was ~10(-3) Mearth, lower by at least an order of magnitude than most previous models suggest. Our dynamically and geochemically self-consistent scenario requires that future N-body simulations of rocky planet formation either directly incorporate collisional grinding or rely on pebble accretion.",16,[],1
1612.04830,astro-ph,"We present a radio-quiet quasar at z=0.237 discovered ""turning on"" by the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF). The transient, iPTF 16bco, was detected by iPTF in the nucleus of a galaxy with an archival SDSS spectrum with weak narrow-line emission characteristic of a low-ionization emission line region (LINER). Our follow-up spectra show the dramatic appearance of broad Balmer lines and a power-law continuum characteristic of a luminous (Lbol~1045 erg/s) type 1 quasar 12 years later. Our photometric monitoring with PTF from 2009-2012, and serendipitous X-ray observations from the XMM-Newton Slew Survey in 2011 and 2015, constrain the change of state to have occurred less than 500 days before the iPTF detection. An enhanced broad Halpha to [OIII]5007 line ratio in the type 1 state relative to other changing-look quasars also is suggestive of the most rapid change of state yet observed in a quasar. We argue that the >10 increase in Eddington ratio inferred from the brightening in UV and X-ray continuum flux is more likely due to an intrinsic change in the accretion rate of a pre-existing accretion disk, than an external mechanism such as variable obscuration, microlensing, or the tidal disruption of a star. However, further monitoring will be helpful in better constraining the mechanism driving this change of state. The rapid ""turn on"" of the quasar is much shorter than the viscous infall timescale of an accretion disk, and requires a disk instability that can develop around a ~108 Msun black hole on timescales less than a year.",16,[],1
1606.08447,astro-ph,"[Abridged] The aim of this work is to search for an absorption signal from exospheric sodium (Na) and singly ionized calcium (Caequation) in the optical transmission spectrum of the hot rocky super-Earth 55 Cancri e. Although the current best-fitting models to the planet mass and radius require a possible atmospheric component, uncertainties in the radius exist, making it possible that 55 Cancri e could be a hot rocky planet without an atmosphere. High resolution (Requation110000) time-series spectra of five transits of 55 Cancri e, obtained with three different telescopes (UVES/VLT, HARPS/ESO 3.6m & HARPS-N/TNG) were analysed. Targeting the sodium D lines and the calcium H and K lines, the potential planet exospheric signal was filtered out from the much stronger stellar and telluric signals, making use of the change of the radial component of the orbital velocity of the planet over the transit from -57 to 57 km/sec. Combining all five transit data sets, we detect a signal potentially associated with sodium in the planet exosphere at a statistical significance level of 3equation. Combining the four HARPS transits that cover the calcium H and K lines, we also find a potential signal from ionized calcium (4.1 equation). Interestingly, this latter signal originates from just one of the transit measurements - with a 4.9equation detection at this epoch. Unfortunately, due to the low significance of the measured sodium signal and the potentially variable Caequation signal, we estimate the p-values of these signals to be too high (corresponding to <4equation) to claim unambiguous exospheric detections. By comparing the observed signals with artificial signals injected early in the analysis, the absorption by Na and Caequation are estimated to be at a level of approximately 2.3equation and 7.0equation respectively, relative to the stellar spectrum.",16,[],1
1609.04024,astro-ph,"We present the results of a broadband radio-to-GeV observing campaign organized to get a better understanding of the radiation processes responsible for the equation-ray flares observed in 3C 279. The total intensity and polarization observations of the source were carried out between December 28, 2013 and January 03, 2014 using the Fermi-LAT, Swift-XRT, Swift-UVOT, and KVN telescopes. A prominent flare observed in the optical/near-UV passbands was found to be correlated with a concurrent equation-ray flare at a confidence level equation95equation, which suggests a co-spatial origin of the two. Moreover, the flaring activity in the two regimes was accompanied by no significant spectral variations. A peak in the X-ray light curve coincides with the peaks of the fractional polarization curves at 43 and 86 GHz radio bands. No prominent variation was noticed for the total intensity and the electric vector position angle (EVPA) observations at radio bands during this period. We noticed a possible hint of steepening of the radio spectrum with an increase in percentage polarization, which suggests that the radio polarization variations could be simply due to a spectral change. In a simple scenario, the correlated optical/equation-ray flares could be caused by the same population of emitting particles. The coincidence of the increase in radio polarization with the X-ray flux supports the picture that X-rays are produced via inverse-Compton scattering of radio photons. The observed fractional variability for the equation-ray flare equation0.23 does not exceed that in the optical regime, which is inconsistent with what we usually observe for 3C 279; it could be due to different dependencies of the magnetic field and the external radiation field energy density profiles along the jet.",16,[],1
1603.08670,astro-ph,"A possible method for linking the optical Gaia Celestial Reference Frame (GCRF) to the VLBI-based International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) is to use radio stars in a manner similar to that in the linking of the Hipparcos Celestial Reference Frame (HCRF) to ICRF. In this work, an obtainable accuracy of the orientation angles between GCRF and ICRF frames was estimated by Monte Carlo simulation. If the uncertainties in the radio star positions obtained by VLBI are in the range of 0.1-4 mas and those obtained by Gaia are in the range of 0.005-0.4 mas, the orientation angle uncertainties are 0.018-0.72 mas if 46 radio stars are used, 0.013-0.51 mas if 92 radio stars are used, and 0.010-0.41~mas if 138 radio stars are used.

1610.02341,astro-ph,"The application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the estimation of HI gas mass fraction (\fgas) is investigated, based on a sample of 13,674 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with HI detections or upper limits from the Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFALFA). We show that, for an example set of fixed input parameters (equation colour and equation-band surface brightness), a multidimensional quadratic model yields \fgas\ scaling relations with a smaller scatter (0.22 dex) than traditional linear fits (0.32 dex), demonstrating that non-linear methods can lead to an improved performance over traditional approaches. A more extensive ANN analysis is performed using 15 galaxy parameters that capture variation in stellar mass, internal structure, environment and star formation. Of the 15 parameters investigated, we find that equation colour, followed by stellar mass surface density, bulge fraction and specific star formation rate have the best connection with \fgas. By combining two control parameters, that indicate how well a given galaxy in SDSS is represented by the ALFALFA training set (\pr) and the scatter in the training procedure (\sigf), we develop a strategy for quantifying which SDSS galaxies our ANN can be adequately applied to, and the associated errors in the \fgas\ estimation. In contrast to previous works, our \fgas\ estimation has no systematic trend with galactic parameters such as Mequation, equation and SFR. We present a catalog of \fgas\ estimates for more than half a million galaxies in the SDSS, of which equation 150,000 galaxies have a secure selection parameter with average scatter in the \fgas\ estimation of 0.22 dex.",16,[],1
1602.04996,astro-ph,"The properties of the relative abundances of rapid and slow neutron-capture elements are studied using a catalog containing spectroscopic abundance determinations for 14~elements produced in various nuclear-synthesis processes for 90~open clusters. The catalog also contains the positions, ages, velocities, and elements of the Galactic orbits of the clusters. The relative abundances of both equation-elements (Eu) and equation-elements (Y, Ba, La, and Ce) in clusters with high, elongated orbits and in field stars of the Galactic thin disk display different dependences on metallicity, age, Galactocentric distance, and the elements of the Galactic orbits, supporting the view that these objects have different natures. In young clusters, not only barium, but also the three other studied equation-elements display significantly higher relative abundances than field stars of the same metallicity. The relative abundances of Eu are lower in high-metallicity clusters (equation) with high, elongated orbits than in field giants, on average, while the [Eu/Fe] ratios in lower-metallicity clusters are the same as those in field stars, on average, although with a large scatter. The metallicity dependence of the [O, Mg/Eu] ratios in clusters with high, elongated orbits and in field stars are substantially different. These and other described properties of the Eu abundances, together with the properties of the abundances of primary equation-elements, can be understood in a natural way if clusters with high, elongated orbits with different metallicities formed as a result of interactions of two types of high-velocity clouds with the interstellar medium of the Galactic disk: low-metallicity high-velocity clouds that formed from ""primordial"" gas, and high-metallicity clouds with intermediate velocities that formed in ""Galactic fountains"".",16,[],1
1603.05417,astro-ph,"Gravity plays a determining role in the evolution of the molecular ISM. In \citet2016arXiv160304342L, we proposed a measure called gravitational energy spectrum to quantify the importance of gravity on multiple physical scales. In this work, using a wavelet-based decomposition technique, we derive the gravitational energy spectra of the Orion A and the Orion B molecular cloud from observational data. The gravitational energy spectra exhibit power-law-like behaviours. From a few pc down to equation pc scale, the Orion A and Orion B molecular cloud have equation and equation, respectively. These scaling exponents are close to the scaling exponents of the kinetic energy power spectrum of compressible turbulence (where equation), with a near-equipartition of turbulent versus gravitational energy on multiple scales. This provides a clear evidence that gravity is able to counteract effectively against turbulent motion for these length scales. The results confirm our earlier analytical estimates. For the Orion A molecular cloud, gravity inevitably dominates over turbulence inside the cloud. Our results provide a clear observational proof that gravity is playing a determining role in the evolution these molecular clouds from the cloud scale down to equation.  However, turbulence is likely to dominate in clouds like California.  The method is general and should be applicable to all the astrophysical problems where gravity plays a role.",16,[],1
1609.01721,astro-ph,"Star formation within the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) may be intimately linked to the orbital dynamics of the gas. Recent models suggest that star formation within the dust ridge molecular clouds (from G0.2530.016 to Sgr B2) follows an evolutionary time sequence, triggered by tidal compression during their preceding pericentre passage. Given that these clouds are the most likely precursors to a generation of massive stars and extreme star clusters, this scenario would have profound implications for constraining the time-evolution of star formation. In this Letter, we search for the initial conditions of the protocluster clouds, focusing on the kinematics of gas situated upstream from pericentre. We observe a highly-regular corrugated velocity field in equation space, with amplitude and wavelength equation kmsequation and equation pc, respectively. The extremes in velocity correlate with a series of massive (equationMequation) and compact (equation pc), quasi-regularly spaced (equation pc), molecular clouds. The corrugation wavelength and cloud separation closely agree with the predicted Toomre (equation pc) and Jeans (equation pc) lengths, respectively. We conclude that gravitational instabilities are driving the condensation of molecular clouds within the Galactic Centre gas stream. Furthermore, we speculate these seeds are the historical analogue of the dust-ridge molecular clouds, representing the initial conditions of star and cluster formation in the CMZ.",16,[],1

The correlation of lateral shower age parameter with other EAS observables is examined, using simulated data in the context of its possible use in a multi-parameter study of EAS, with a view to obtaining information about the nature of the shower initiating primaries at sea level EAS experiments.

1608.04949,astro-ph,"In order to identify diagnostics distinguishing between pre- and post-mass-transfer systems, the mass-ratio distribution and period - eccentricity (P - e) diagram of barium and S stars are compared to those of the sample of binary red giants in open clusters from Mermilliod et al.

They represent 22% of the sample, which are thus candidate post-mass-transfer systems. Among these candidates which occupy the same locus as the barium and S stars in the (P-e) diagram, only 33% (= 4/12) show a chemical signature of mass transfer in the form of s-process overabundances (from rather moderate -- about 0.3 dex -- to more extreme -- about 1 dex). These s-process-enriched cluster stars show a clear tendency to be in the clusters with the lowest metallicity in the sample, confirming the classical prediction that the s-process nucleosynthesis is more efficient at low metallicities (the only strong barium star in our sample is found in the cluster with the lowest metallicity, i.e., star 173 in NGC 2420, with [Fe/H] = -0.26). The s-process overabundance is not clearly correlated with the cluster turnoff (TO) mass (such a correlation would instead hint at the importance of the dilution factor).

If Proxima Centauri b is a terrestrial world with an Earth-like atmosphere and magnetic field, we estimate the power at the 5577\AA\ OI auroral line is on the order of 0.1 TW under steady-state stellar wind, or equation stronger than that on Earth. This corresponds to a planet-star contrast ratio of equation in a narrow band about the 5577\AA\ line, although higher contrast (equation) may be possible during periods of strong magnetospheric disturbance (auroral power equation TW). We searched the Proxima Centauri b HARPS data for the 5577\AA\ line and for other prominent oxygen and nitrogen lines, but find no signal, indicating that the OI auroral line contrast must be lower than equation (with power equation 3,000 TW), consistent with our predictions. We find that observations of 0.1 TW auroral emission lines are likely infeasible with current and planned telescopes. However, future observations with a space-based coronagraphic telescope or a ground-based extremely large telescope (ELT) with a coronagraph could push sensitivity down to terawatt oxygen aurorae (contrast equation) with exposure times of equation day.

Such ultra-steep spectrum relic radio lobes without definitive hot-spots are rare, and they provide an opportunity to understand the life-cycle of relativistic jets and physics of black hole mergers in dense environments. We interpret our observations of this radio source in the context of the growth of its central black hole, triggering of its AGN activity and jet precession, all possibly caused by galaxy mergers in this dense galactic system.

Over the first ~1000 days, KIC 8462852 faded approximately linearly at a rate of 0.341 /- 0.041%/yr, for a total decline of 0.9%. KIC 8462852 then dimmed much more rapidly in the next ~200 days, with its flux dropping by more than 2%. For the final ~200 days of Kepler photometry the magnitude remained approximately constant, although the data are also consistent with the decline rate measured for the first 2.7 yr. Of a sample of 193 nearby comparison stars and 355 stars with similar stellar parameters, none exhibit the rapid decline by 2% or the cumulative fading by 3% of KIC 8462852. Moreover, of these comparison stars, only one changes brightness as quickly as the 0.341%/yr measured for KIC 8462852 during the first three years of the Kepler mission.

1605.03962,astro-ph,"A large number of direct imaging surveys for exoplanets have been performed in recent years, yielding the first directly imaged planets and providing constraints on the prevalence and distribution of wide planetary systems. However, like most of the radial velocity ones, these surveys generally focus on single stars, hence binaries and higher-order multiples have not been studied to the same level of scrutiny. This motivated the SPOTS (Search for Planets Orbiting Two Stars) survey, which is an ongoing direct imaging study of a large sample of close binaries, started with VLT/NACO and now continuing with VLT/SPHERE. To complement this survey, we have identified the close binary targets in 24 published direct imaging surveys. Here we present our statistical analysis of this combined body of data. We analysed a sample of 117 tight binary systems, using a combined Monte Carlo and Bayesian approach to derive the expected values of the frequency of companions, for different values of the companion's semi-major axis. Our analysis suggest that the frequency of sub-stellar companions in wide orbit is moderately low (equation13% with a best value of 6% at 95% confidence level) and not significantly different between single stars and tight binaries. One implication of this result is that the very high frequency of circumbinary planets in wide orbits around post-common envelope binaries, implied by eclipse timing (up to 90% according to Zorotovic & Schreiber 2013), can not be uniquely due to planets formed before the common-envelope phase (first generation planets), supporting instead the second generation planet formation or a non-Keplerian origin of the timing variations.",16,[],1
1608.01633,astro-ph,"Galaxy modelling is greatly simplified by assuming the existence of a global system of angle-action coordinates. Unfortunately, global angle-action coordinates do not exist because some orbits become trapped by resonances, especially where the radial and vertical frequencies coincide. We show that in a realistic Galactic potential such trapping occurs only on thick-disc and halo orbits (speed relative to the guiding centre >~80 km/s). We explain how the Torus Mapper code (TM) behaves in regions of phase space in which orbits are resonantly trapped, and we extend TM so trapped orbits can be manipulated as easily as untrapped ones. The impact that the resonance has on the structure of velocity space depends on the weights assigned to trapped orbits. The impact is everywhere small if each trapped orbit is assigned the phase space density equal to the time average along the orbit of the DF for untrapped orbits. The impact could be significant with a different assignment of weights to trapped orbits.",16,[],1

The hard X-ray spectrum of Markarian 3 is variable on all the time scales probed by our campaign, down to a few days. The observed continuum variability is due to an intrinsically variable primary continuum seen in transmission through a large, but still Compton-thin column density (NH~0.8-1.1equation10equation cmequation). If arranged in a spherical-toroidal geometry, the Compton scattering matter has an opening angle ~66 degrees and is seen at a grazing angle through its upper rim (inclination angle ~70 degrees).

This was originally interpreted as arising from lithium created by the Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Recent observations, however, have revealed that ultra metal-poor stars (UMP stars; equation) have significantly lower lithium abundances than that of the plateau. Since most of the UMP stars are CEMP-no stars, carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars with no excess of neutron-capture elements, a connection between the carbon enhancement and lithium depletion is suspected. A straightforward approach to this question is to investigate carbon-normal UMP stars. However only one object is known in this class. As an alternative, we have determined lithium abundances for two CEMP-no main-sequence turn-off stars with metallicities equation, where there are numerous carbon-normal stars with available lithium abundances that can be considered. Our 1D LTE analysis indicates that the two CEMP-no stars have lithium abundances that are consistent with values near the plateau, which suggests that carbon enhancement and lithium depletion are not directly related. Instead, our results suggest that extremely low iron abundance is a fundamental cause to depleted lithium in UMP stars.",16,[],1
1602.04362,astro-ph,"Clouds have been shown to be present in many exoplanetary atmospheres. Cloud formation modeling predicts considerable inhomogeneities of cloud cover, consistent with optical phase curve observations. However, optical phase curves cannot resolve some existing degeneracies between cloud location and cloud optical properties.   We present a conceptually simple technique to detect inhomogeneous cloud cover on exoplanets. Such an inhomogeneous cloud cover produces an asymmetric primary transit of the planet in front of the host star. Asymmetric transits produce characteristic residuals compared to a standard symmetric model. Furthermore, bisector spans can be used to determine asymmetries in the transit light curve.   We apply a model of asymmetric transits to the light curves of HAT-P-7b, Kepler-7b and HD209458b and search for possible cloud signatures. The nearly uninterrupted Kepler photometry is particularly well-suited for this method since it allows for a very high time resolution.   We do not find any statistically sound cloud signature in the data of the considered planets. For HAT-P-7b, a tentative detection of an asymmetric cloud cover is found, consistent with analysis of the optical phase curve. Based on Bayesian probability arguments, a symmetric model with an offset in the transit ephemeris remains, however, the most viable model. Still, this work demonstrates that for suitable targets, namely low-gravity planets around bright stars, the method can be used to constrain cloud cover characteristics and is thus a helpful additional tool to study exoplanetary atmospheres.",16,[],1
1609.03572,astro-ph,"Although there has been much progress in understanding how galaxies evolve, we still do not understand how and when they stop forming stars and become quiescent. We address this by applying our galaxy spectral energy distribution models, which incorporate physically motivated star formation histories (SFHs) from cosmological simulations, to a sample of quiescent galaxies at equation. A total of 845 quiescent galaxies with multi-band photometry spanning rest-frame ultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths are selected from the CANDELS dataset. We compute median SFHs of these galaxies in bins of stellar mass and redshift. At all redshifts and stellar masses, the median SFHs rise, reach a peak, and then decline to reach quiescence. At high redshift, we find that the rise and decline are fast, as expected because the Universe is young. At low redshift, the duration of these phases depends strongly on stellar mass. Low-mass galaxies (equation) grow on average slowly, take a long time to reach their peak of star formation (equation Gyr), and the declining phase is fast (equation Gyr). Conversely, high-mass galaxies (equation) grow on average fast (equation Gyr), and, after reaching their peak, decrease the star formation slowly (equation Gyr). These findings are consistent with galaxy stellar mass being a driving factor in determining how evolved galaxies are, with high-mass galaxies being the most evolved at any time (i.e., downsizing). The different durations we observe in the declining phases also suggest that low- and high-mass galaxies experience different quenching mechanisms that operate on different timescales.",16,[],1

The data were obtained with the SPHERE instrument mounted on ESO Very Large Telescope, and cover three fields in the core of this cluster. We applied a correction for the effect of extinction to our data obtained in the J and K broadband filters and estimated the mass of detected sources inside the field of view of SPHERE/IRDIS, which is 13.5""x13.5"". We derived the mass function (MF) slope for each spectral band and field. The MF slope in the core is unusual compared to previous results based on Hubble space telescope (HST) and very large telescope (VLT) observations. The average slope in the core is estimated as -1.060.26-0.26 for the main sequence stars with 3.5 Msun < M < 120 Msun.Thanks to the SPHERE extreme adaptive optics, 814 low-mass stars were detected to estimate the MF slope for the pre-main sequence stars with 0.6 Msun< M < 3.5 Msun , Gamma = -0.540.11-0.11 in the K-band images in two fields in the core of the cluster.

1601.00409,astro-ph,"In this paper, assuming the validity of distance duality relation, equation, where equation and equation are the angular and the luminosity distance respectively, we explore two kinds of gas mass density profiles of clusters: the isothermal equation model and the non-isothermal double-equation model. In our analysis, performed on 38 massive galaxy clusters observed by \textitChandra (within the redshift range of equation), we use two types of cluster gas mass fraction data corresponding to different mass density profiles fitted to the X-ray data. Using two general parameterizations of equation (phenomenologically allowing for distance duality violation), we find that the non-isothermal double-equation model agrees better with the distance duality relation, while the isothermal equation model tends to be marginally incompatible with the Etherington theorem at 68.3% CL. However, current accuracy of the data does not allow to distinguish between the two models for the gas-density distribution at a significant level.",16,[],1
1610.03877,astro-ph,"Galaxy mergers are believed to trigger strong starbursts. This is well assessed by observations in the local Universe. However the efficiency of this mechanism has poorly been tested so far for high redshift, actively star forming, galaxies. We present a suite of pc-resolution hydrodynamical numerical simulations to compare the star formation process along a merging sequence of high and low z galaxies, by varying the gas mass fraction between the two models. We show that, for the same orbit, high-redshift gas-rich mergers are less efficient than low-redshift ones at producing starbursts: the star formation rate excess induced by the merger and its duration are both around 10 times lower than in the low gas fraction case. The mechanisms that account for the star formation triggering at low redshift - the increased compressive turbulence, gas fragmentation, and central gas inflows - are only mildly, if not at all, enhanced for high gas fraction galaxy encounters. Furthermore, we show that the strong stellar feedback from the initially high star formation rate in high redshift galaxies does not prevent an increase of the star formation during the merger. Our results are consistent with the observed increase of the number of major mergers with increasing redshift being faster than the respective increase in the number of starburst galaxies.",16,[],1
1612.06406,astro-ph,"Several high-resolution spectroscopic studies have provided compelling observational evidence that open clusters display a decreasing trend of their barium abundances as a function of the cluster's age. Young clusters (ages~200 Myr) exhibit significant enhancement in the [Ba/Fe] ratios, at variance with solar-age clusters where the Ba content has been found to be [Ba/Fe]~0 dex. Different viable solutions have been suggested in the literature, nevertheless, a conclusive interpretation of such a peculiar trend has not been found. Interestingly, it is debated whether the other species produced with Ba via s-process reactions do follow the same trend with age. Pre-main sequence clusters (~10-50 Myr) show the most extreme behaviour in this respect: their [Ba/Fe] ratios can reach 0.65 dex, which higher than the solar value by a factor of four. Crucially, there are no investigations of the other s-process species for these young stellar populations. In this paper we present, the first determination of Y, Zr, La, and Ce in clusters IC 2391, IC 2602 and the Argus association. The main objective of our work is to ascertain whether these elements reveal the same enhancement as Ba. Our results indicate that, at variance with Ba, all the other s-process species exhibit a solar scaled pattern: these clusters confirm a similar trend discovered in the slightly older local associations (e.g., AB Doradus, Carina Near), where only Ba exhibit enhanced value with all other s process species being solar. We have discussed several possible explanations such as e.g., chromospheric effects, departures from the LTE approximation, or the activation of a different nucleosynthesis chain. We cannot currently provide the definite answer to this question and future investigations from theoretical and observational perspectives are sorely needed.",16,[],1
1609.05045,astro-ph,"The detection of complex organic molecules (COMs) toward cold sources such as pre-stellar cores (with T<10 K), has challenged our understanding of the formation processes of COMs in the interstellar medium. Recent modelling on COM chemistry at low temperatures has provided new insight into these processes predicting that COM formation depends strongly on parameters such as visual extinction and the level of CO freeze out. We report deep observations of COMs toward two positions in the L1544 pre-stellar core: the dense, highly-extinguished continuum peak with Av>=30 mag within the inner 2700 au; and a low-density shell with average Av~7.5-8 mag located at 4000 au from the core's center and bright in CH3OH. Our observations show that CH3O, CH3OCH3 and CH3CHO are more abundant (by factors ~2-10) toward the low-density shell than toward the continuum peak. Other COMs such as CH3OCHO, c-C3H2O, HCCCHO, CH2CHCN and HCCNC show slight enhancements (by factors <=3) but the associated uncertainties are large. This suggests that COMs are actively formed and already present in the low-density shells of pre-stellar cores. The modelling of the chemistry of O-bearing COMs in L1544 indicates that these species are enhanced in this shell because i) CO starts freezing out onto dust grains driving an active surface chemistry; ii) the visual extinction is sufficiently high to prevent the UV photo-dissociation of COMs by the external interstellar radiation field; and iii) the density is still moderate to prevent severe depletion of COMs onto grains.",16,[],1

1607.06436,astro-ph,"Measurement of the brightness temperature of extended radio emission demands knowledge of the gain (or aperture efficiency) of the telescope and measurement of the polarized component of the emission requires correction for the conversion of unpolarized emission from sky and ground to apparently polarized signal. Radiation properties of the John A. Galt Telescope at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory were studied through analysis and measurement in order to provide absolute calibration of a survey of polarized emission from the entire northern sky from 1280 to 1750 MHz, and to understand the polarization performance of the telescope. Electromagnetic simulators CST and GRASP-10 were used to compute radiation patterns of the telescope in all Stokes parameters, and aperture efficiency. Aperture efficiency was also evaluated using geometrical optics and was measured using Cyg A. Measured aperture efficiency varied smoothly with frequency between values of 0.49 and 0.54; GRASP-10 yielded values 6.5% higher but with closely similar variation with frequency. Overall error across the frequency band is 3%, but values at any two frequencies are relatively correct to ~1%. Dominant influences on aperture efficiency are illumination taper of the feed radiation pattern and shadowing by the feed-support struts. A model of ground emission was developed based on measurements and on empirical data from remote sensing of the Earth from satellite-borne telescopes. This model was convolved with the computed antenna response to estimate conversion of ground emission into spurious polarized signal. The computed spurious signal is comparable to measured values, but is not accurate enough to be used to correct observations. A simpler model, in which the ground is considered as an unpolarized emitter with a brightness temperature of ~240 K, is shown to have useful accuracy when compared to measurements.",16,[],1

1601.08140,astro-ph,"We consider eternal inflation in hilltop-type inflation models, favored by current data, in which the scalar field in inflation rolls off of a local maximum of the potential. Unlike chaotic or plateau-type inflation models, in hilltop inflation the region of field space which supports eternal inflation is finite, and the expansion rate equation during eternal inflation is almost exactly the same as the expansion rate equation during slow roll inflation. Therefore, in any given Hubble volume, there is a finite and calculable expectation value for the lifetime of the ""eternal"" inflation phase, during which quantum flucutations dominate over classical field evolution. We show that despite this, inflation in hilltop models is nonetheless eternal in the sense that the volume of the spacetime at any finite time is exponentially dominated by regions which continue to inflate. This is true regardless of the energy scale of inflation, and eternal inflation is supported for inflation at arbitrarily low energy scale.",16,[],1

Halos with spins within several standard deviations of the simulated mean (equation) produce profiles with negligible deviations from the universal form. Only when the spin becomes quite large (equation) do departures become evident. The angular momentum distribution also exhibits a near universal form, which is also independent of halo spin up to equation. A correlation between these epidemic profiles and the presence of a strong bar in the virialized halo is also observed. These bar structures bear resemblance to the radial orbit instability in the rotationless limit.",16,[],1

1603.07381,astro-ph,"Realistic stellar atmospheric models of two typical metal-poor giant stars in Omega Centauri that include a chromosphere influence the formation of optical lines of Oxygen I: the forbidden lines (630nm, 636nm) and the infrared triplet (777.1-777.5 nm). One-dimensional semi-empirical non-LTE models are constructed based on observed Balmer lines. A full non-LTE formulation is applied in evaluating line strengths of O I including photoionization by the Lyman continuum and photoexcitation by Ly-alpha and Ly-beta. Chromospheric models (CHR) yield forbidden oxygen transitions that are stronger than in radiative/convective equilibrium (RCE) models. The triplet oxygen lines from high levels also appear stronger than produced in an RCE model. The inferred oxygen abundance from realistic CHR models for these two stars is decreased by factors ~3 as compared to values derived from RCE models. A lower oxygen abundance suggests that intermediate mass AGB stars contribute to the observed abundance pattern in globular clusters. A change in the oxygen abundance of metal-poor field giants could affect models of deep mixing episodes on the red giant branch.

1610.08505,astro-ph,"We present Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy of individual stars in the relatively isolated Local Group dwarf galaxies Leo A, Aquarius, and the Sagittarius dwarf irregular galaxy. The three galaxies--but especially Leo A and Aquarius--share in common delayed star formation histories relative to many other isolated dwarf galaxies. The stars in all three galaxies are supported by dispersion. We found no evidence of stellar velocity structure, even for Aquarius, which has rotating HI gas. The velocity dispersions indicate that all three galaxies are dark matter-dominated, with dark-to-baryonic mass ratios ranging from equation (SagDIG) to equation (Aquarius). Leo A and SagDIG have lower stellar metallicities than Aquarius, and they also have higher gas fractions, both of which would be expected if Aquarius were farther along in its chemical evolution. The metallicity distribution of Leo A is inconsistent with a Closed or Leaky Box model of chemical evolution, suggesting that the galaxy was pre-enriched or acquired external gas during star formation. The metallicities of stars increased steadily for all three galaxies, but possibly at different rates. The [equation/Fe] ratios at a given [Fe/H] are lower than that of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, which indicates more extended star formation histories than Sculptor, consistent with photometrically derived star formation histories. Overall, the bulk kinematic and chemical properties for the late-forming dwarf galaxies do not diverge significantly from those of less delayed dwarf galaxies, including dwarf spheroidal galaxies.",16,[],1

In low-density stellar environments, such as dSphs, the abundance of MSPs is expected to be proportional to stellar mass. Accordingly, we construct the equation-ray luminosity function of MSPs in the Milky Way disk, where equation individual MSPs have been detected with the equation Large Area Telescope (LAT), and scale this luminosity function to the stellar masses of 30 dSphs to estimate the cumulative emission from their MSP populations. We predict that MSPs within the highest stellar mass dSphs, Fornax and Sculptor, produce a equation-ray flux equation~MeV of equation~ph~cmequation~sequation, which is a factor equation below the current LAT sensitivity at high Galactic latitudes. The MSP emission in ultra-faint dSphs, including targets with the largest J-factors, is typically several orders of magnitude lower, suggesting that these targets will remain clean targets for indirect DM searches in the foreseeable future. For a DM particle of mass 25~GeV annihilating to equation quarks at the thermal relic cross section (consistent with DM interpretations of the Galactic Center excess), we find that the expected equation-ray emission due to DM exceeds that of MSPs in all of the target dSphs.

1604.01313,astro-ph,"We study the X-ray absorption of a complete sample of 99 bright Swift gamma-ray bursts. Over the last few years, a strong correlation between the intrinsic X-ray absorbing column density (NH(z)) and the redshift was found. This absorption excess in high-z GRBs is now thought to be due to the overlooked contribution of the absorption along the intergalactic medium, by means of both intervening objects and the diffuse warm-hot intergalactic medium along the line of sight. In this work we neglect the absorption along the IGM, because our purpose is to study the eventual effect of a radical change in the Galactic absorption model on the NH(z) distribution. Therefore, we derive the intrinsic absorbing column densities using two different Galactic absorption models, the Leiden Argentine Bonn HI survey and the more recent model including molecular hydrogen. We find that, if on the one hand the new Galactic model considerably affects the single column density values, on the other hand there is no drastic change in the distribution as a whole. It becomes clear that the contribution of Galactic column densities alone, no matter how improved, is not sufficient to change the observed general trend and it has to be considered as a second-order correction. The cosmological increase of NH(z) as a function of redshift persists and, in order to explain the observed distribution, it is necessary to include the contribution of both the diffuse intergalactic medium and the intervening systems along the line of sight of the GRBs.",16,[],1

1609.01294,astro-ph,"The double red clump (RC) observed in the Milky Way bulge is widely interpreted as evidence for an X-shaped structure. We have recently suggested, however, an alternative interpretation based on the multiple population phenomenon, where the bright RC is from helium enhanced second-generation stars (G2), while the faint RC is representing first-generation stars (G1) with normal helium abundance. Here our RC models are constructed in a large parameter space to see the effects of metallicity, age, and helium abundance on the double RC feature. Our models show that the luminosity of RC stars is mainly affected by helium abundance, while the RC color is primarily affected by metallicity. The effect of age is relatively small, unless it is older than 12 Gyr or much younger than 6 Gyr. The observed double RC feature can therefore be reproduced in a relatively large parameter space, once letterY between G2 and G1 is assumed to be greater than equation0.10.

Our goal is to probe the geometry of the emitting plasma around Sgr A* by using modeled mm-VLBI closure phase calculations at 1.3 mm and to constrain the observer's inclination angle and position angle of the black hole spin axis. We have simulated images for three different models of the emission of Sgr A*: an orbiting spot, a disk model, and a jet model. The orbiting spot model was used as a test case scenario, while the disk and jet models are physically driven scenarios based on standard three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of hot accretion flows. Our results are compared to currently available closure phase observational limits. Our results indicate that more models with closer to edge-on viewing angles are consistent with observational limits. In general, jet and disk geometries can reproduce similar closure phases for different sets of viewing and position angles. Consequently, the favored black hole spin orientation and its magnitude are strongly model dependent. We find that both the jet and the disk models can explain current VLBI limits.

The combined HST and SDSS data indicates a much more pronounced variability when the sampling time between observations in the quasar rest frame is equation sec compared to equation sec. Based on an excess variance analysis, for time intervals equation sec in the quasar rest frame, equation of the quasars (4/40) show evidence of EUV variability. Similarly, for time intervals equation sec in the quasar rest frame, equation of the quasars (21/38) show evidence of EUV variability. The propensity for variability does not show any statistically significant change between equation sec and equation sec (1 yr). The temporal behavior is one of a threshold time interval for significant variability as opposed to a gradual increase on these time scales. A threshold time scale can indicate a characteristic spatial dimension of the EUV region. We explore this concept in the context of the slim disk models of accretion. We find that for rapidly spinning black holes, the radial infall time to the plunge region of the optically thin surface layer of the slim disk that is responsible for the preponderance of the EUV flux emission (primarily within 0 - 7 black hole radii from the inner edge of the disk) is consistent with the empirically determined variability time scale.",16,[],1
1610.07840,astro-ph,"Classification of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) into groups has been intensively studied by various statistical tests in previous years. It has been suggested that there was a distinct group of GRBs, beyond the long and short ones, with intermediate durations. However, such a group is not securely confirmed yet. Strangely, concerning the spectral hardness, the observations from the Swift and RHESSI satellites give different results. For the Swift/BAT database it is found that the intermediate-duration bursts might well be related to so-called X-ray flashes (XRFs). On the other hand, for the RHESSI dataset the intermediate-duration bursts seem to be spectrally too hard to be given by XRFs. The connection of the intermediate-duration bursts and XRFs for the BATSE database is not clear as well. The purpose of this article is to check the relation between XRFs and GRBs for the BATSE and RHESSI databases, respectively. We use an empirical definition of XRFs introduced by other authors earlier. For the RHESSI database we also use a transformation between the detected counts and the fluences based on the simulated detector response function. The purpose is to compare the hardnesses of GRBs with the definition of XRFs. There is a 1.3-4.2 % fraction of XRFs in the whole BATSE database. The vast majority of the BATSE short bursts are not XRFs because only 0.7-5.7 % of the short bursts can be given by XRFs. However, there is a large uncertainty in the fraction of XRFs among the intermediate-duration bursts. The fraction of 1-85 % of the BATSE intermediate-duration bursts can be related to XRFs.

Depending on the Reynolds number Re, we studied the dynamical behaviors of fibers for the (a) Re =0 and (b) finite Re cases, for different draw ratios Dr, ranging from 10 to 30, and two typical Deborah numbers De=equation and De=equation. In the limit Reequation 0 (a), as the Deborah number De increases, the elastic effect makes the system stable. At finite Re (b), we found that inertial effects play an important role in determining the dynamical behavior of the spinning process, and for Dr=equation the system is quite stable, at least up to a draw ratio of Dr=30. We also found that the fiber velocity and cross section area are determined solely by the draw ratio. By comparing the velocity and cross section area profiles with the end-point distribution for the dumbbell connective vectors, for dumbbells located in Lagrangian particles along typical places along the spinning line, we show that our multiscale simulation method successfully bridges the microscopic state of the system with its simultaneous macroscopic flow behavior. It is also confirmed that the present schemes gives good agreements with the results obtained by the Maxwell constitutive equation.",16,[],8
1608.03869,cond-mat,"In a broad class of complex materials a quench leads to a multi-scaled relaxation process known as aging. To explain its commonality and the astounding insensitivity to most microscopic details, record dynamics (RD) posits that a small set of increasingly rare and irreversible events, so called quakes, controls the dynamics. While key predictions of RD are known to concur with a number of experimental and simulational results, its basic assumption on the nature of quake statistics has proven extremely difficult to verify experimentally. The careful distinction of rare (""record"") cage-breaking events from in-cage rattle accomplished in previous experiments on jammed colloids, enables us to extract the first direct experimental evidence for the fundamental hypothesis of RD that the rate of quakes decelerates with the inverse of the system age. The resulting description shows the predicted growth of the particle mean square displacement and of a mesoscopic lengthscale with the logarithm of time.",16,[],8
1610.02926,cond-mat,"We demonstrate the nonlinear frequency conversion of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) frequency by optically excited elastic waves in a thin metallic film on dielectric substrates. Time-resolved probing of the magnetization directly witnesses magneto-elastically driven second harmonic generation, sum- and difference frequency mixing from two distinct frequencies, as well as parametric downconversion of each individual drive frequency. Starting from the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations, we derive an analytical equation of an elastically driven nonlinear parametric oscillator and show that frequency mixing is dominated by the parametric modulation of FMR frequency.",16,[],8
1603.02742,cond-mat,"Within this work, the kinetics of the growing stage of porous silicon (PS) during the etching process was studied using the photoacoustic technique. A p-type Si with low resistivity was used as a substrate. An extension of Rosencwaig and Gersho model is proposed in order to analyze the temporary changes that take place in the amplitude of the photoacoustic signal during the PS growth. The solution of the heat equation takes into account the modulated laser beam, the changes in the reflectance of the PS-backing heterostructure, the electrochemical reaction, and the Joule effect as thermal sources. The model includes the time-dependence of the sample thickness during the electrochemical etching of PS. The changes in the reflectance are identified as the laser reflections in the internal layers of the system. The reflectance is modeled by an additional sinusoidal-monochromatic light source and its modulated frequency is related to the velocity of the PS growth. The chemical reaction and the DC components of the heat sources are taken as an average value from the experimental data. The theoretical results are in agreement with the experimental data and hence provided a method to determine variables of the PS growth, such as the etching velocity and the thickness of the porous layer during the growing process.",16,[],8

In this work we present a universal method to study heavy hole anisotropy using a dark exciton in a moderate in-plane magnetic field. By analysis of the linear polarization of the dark exciton photoluminescence we identify both isotropic and anisotropic contributions to the hole g-factor. We employ this method for a number of individual self-assembled CdTe/ZnTe quantum dots, demonstrating a variety of behaviors of in-plane hole g-factor: from almost fully anisotropic to almost isotropic. We conclude that, in general, both contributions play an important role and neither contribution can be neglected.",16,[],8
1606.08911,cond-mat,"These notes cover in some detail lectures I gave at the Les Houches Summer School 2012. I describe here work done with Deepak Iyer with important contributions from Hujie Guan. I discuss some aspects of the physics revealed by quantum quenches and present a formalism for studying the quench dynamics of integrable systems. The formalism presented generalizes an approach by Yudson and is applied to Lieb-Liniger model which describes a gas of equation interacting bosons moving on the continuous infinite line while interacting via a short range potential. We carry out the quench from several initial states and for any number of particles and compute the evolution of the density and the noise correlations. In the long time limit the system dilutes and we find that for any value of repulsive coupling independently of the initial state the system asymptotes towards astrongly repulsive gas, while for any value of attractive coupling, the system forms a maximal bound state that dominates at longer times. In either case the system equilibrates but does not thermalize, an effect that is consistent with prethermalization. These results can be confronted with experiments. For much more detail see: Phys. Rev. A 87, 053628 (2013) on which these notes are based. Further applications of the approach to the Heisenberg model and to the Anderson model will be presented elsewhere.",16,[],8
1602.08607,cond-mat,"A recent paper (Healey et al., J. Nonlin. Sci., 2013, 23:777-805.) predicted the disappearance of the stretch-induced wrinkled pattern of thin, clamped, elastic sheets by numerical simulation of the Foppl-von K\'arm\'an equations extended to the finite in-plane strain regime. It has also been revealed that for some aspect ratios of the rectangular domain wrinkles do not occur at all regardless of the applied extension. To verify these predictions we carried out experiments on thin 20 micrometer thick adhesive covered), previously prestressed elastomer sheets with different aspect ratios under displacement controlled pull tests. On one hand the the adjustment of the material properties during prestressing is highly advantageous as in targeted strain regime the film becomes substantially linearly elastic (which is far not the case without prestress). On the other hand a significant, non-ignorable orthotropy develops during this first extension. To enable quantitative comparisons we abandoned the assumption about material isotropy inherent in the original model and derived the governing equations for an orthotropic medium. In this way we found good agreement between numerical simulations and experimental data.   Analysis of the negativity of the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor revealed that the critical stretch for a bifurcation point at which the wrinkles disappear must be finite for any aspect ratio. On the contrary there is no such a bound for the aspect ratio as a bifurcation parameter. Physically this manifests as complicated wrinkled patterns with more than one highly wrinkled zones on the surface in case of elongated rectangles. These arrangements have been found both numerically and experimentally. These findings also support the new, finite strain model, since the Foppl-von K\'arm\'an equations based on infinitesimal strains do not exhibit such a behavior.",16,[],8
1603.07132,cond-mat,"Phase behavior of the Yukawa hard-sphere polydisperse mixture with high degree of polydispersity is studied using high temperature approximation (HTA) and mean spherical approximation (MSA). We have extended and applied the scheme developed to calculate the phase diagrams of polydisperse mixtures described by the truncatable free energy models, i.e., the models with Helmholtz free energy defined by the finite number of the moments of the species distribution function. At high degree of polydispersity, several new features in the topology of the two-phase diagram have been observed: the cloud and shadow curves intersect twice and each of them forms a closed loop of the ellipsoidal-like shape with the liquid and gas branches of the cloud curve almost coinciding. Approaching a certain limiting value of the polydispersity index, the cloud and shadow curves shrink and disappear. Beyond this limiting value, polydispersity induces the appearance of the three-phase equilibrium at lower temperatures. We present and analyze corresponding phase diagrams together with distribution functions of three coexisting phases. In general, good agreement was observed between predictions of the two different theoretical methods, i.e., HTA and MSA. Our results confirm qualitative predictions for the three-phase coexistence obtained earlier within the framework of the van der Waals approach.",16,[],8
1609.02242,cond-mat,"Topological insulator (TI) thin films differ from the more commonly studied semi-infinite bulk TIs in that the former possesses both top and bottom surfaces where the surface states localized at different surfaces can couple to one another due to the finite thickness of the film. In the presence of an in-plane mangnetization TI thin films display two distinct phases depending on which of the inter-surface coupling or the magnetization is stronger. In this work, we consider a TI thin film system with an in-plane magnetization and calculate numerically the resulting spin accumulation on both surfaces of the film due to an in-plane electric field to linear order. We describe a numerical scheme for performing the Kubo calculation calculation in which we include impurity scattering and vertex corrections. We find that the sums of the spin accumulation over the two surfaces in the in-plane direction perpendicular to the magnetization, and in the out of plane direction, are antisymmetric in Fermi energy about the charge neutrality point and are non-vanishing only when the symmetry between the top and bottom TI surfaces is broken. The impurity scattering, in general, diminishes the magnitude of the spin accumulation and can also change the sign of the spin accumulation at some Fermi energies where the accumulation is small.",16,[],8

The temperature dependences of the resistivity for Nb are in good agreement with the McMillan model which indicates the strong influence of the inverse proximity effect induced by the interface. The increased influence of the BiOCl/Nb interface under laser excitation corresponds to the raising the ratio of the density of normal to superconductivity carriers in the equation limit and this observation is in agreement with the photoconductivity study of BiOCl single crystals.",16,[],8
1609.07607,cond-mat,"This third part extends the theory of Generalized Poisson-Kac (GPK) processes to nonlinear stochastic models and to a continuum of states. Nonlinearity is treated in two ways: (i) as a dependence of the parameters (intensity of the stochastic velocity, transition rates) of the stochastic perturbation on the state variable, similarly to the case of nonlinear Langevin equations, and (ii) as the dependence of the stochastic microdynamic equations of motion on the statistical description of the process itself (nonlinear Fokker-Planck-Kac models). Several numerical and physical examples illustrate the theory. Gathering nonlinearity and a continuum of states, GPK theory provides a stochastic derivation of the nonlinear Boltzmann equation, furnishing a positive answer to the Kac's program in kinetic theory. The transition from stochastic microdynamics to transport theory within the framework of the GPK paradigm is also addressed.",16,[],8

This material exhibits a zero-temperature upper critical field of 90 T and 65 T parallel and perpendicular to the FeequationAsequation planes, respectively. An unprecedented superconducting magnetic anisotropy equation is observed near Tc, and it decreases at lower temperatures as expected in multiband superconductors. Direct measurement of the electronic anisotropy was performed on microfabricated samples, showing a value of equation that raises up to 19 near Tc. Finally, we have studied the pressure and temperature dependence of the in-plane resistivity. The critical temperature decreases linearly upon application of hydrostatic pressure (up to 2 GPa) similarly to overdoped cuprate superconductors. The resistivity shows saturation at high temperatures, suggesting that the material approaches the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit for metallic conduction. Indeed, we have successfully modelled the resistivity in the normal state with a parallel resistor model that is widely accepted for this state. All the measured quantities suggest strong pressure dependence of the density of states.",16,[],8
1609.03877,cond-mat,"We study nanodevices based on ultrathin superconducting nanowires connected in parallel to form nanowire SQUIDs. The function of the critical current versus magnetic field, equation, is multivalued, asymmetric and its maxima and minima are shifted from the usual integer and half integer flux quantum points. The nanowire interference device is qualitatively distinct from conventional SQUIDs because nanowires do not obey the same current-phase relationship (CPR) as Josephson junctions. We demonstrate that the results can be explained assuming that (i) the CPR is linear and (ii) that each wire is characterized by a sample-specific critical phase, which is usually much larger than equation. Our proposed model offers accurate fits to equation. It explains the single-valuedness regions where only one vorticity (i.e., the order parameter winding number) is stable as well as regions where multiple vorticity values are allowed for the SQUIDs. We also observe and explain regions in which the standard deviation of the switching current is independent of the magnetic field. We develop a technique that allows a reliable detection of hidden phase-slips. Using this technique we find that our model correctly predicts the boundaries of vorticity regions, even at low currents where equation is not directly measurable.",16,[],8

Solution-processed thin films of CH3NH3BaI3 exhibited a high band gap of approximately 3.87 eV, which is in excellent agreement with the theoretical estimate of 4 eV. Also, the XRD patterns of the thin films match well with the l-peaks of the simulated pattern obtained from the relaxed unit cell of CH3NH3BaI3, crystallizing in the I4/mcm space group, with lattice parameters, a = 9.30 A, c = 13.94 A. Atom projected density of state and band structure calculations reveal the conduction and valence band edges to be comprised primarily of Barium d-orbitals and Iodine p-orbitals, respectively. The larger band gap of CH3NH3BaI3 compared to CH3NH3PbI3 can be attributed to the lower electro-negativity coupled with the lack of d-orbitals in the valence band of Ba2. A more detailed analysis reveals the excellent chemical and mechanical stability of CH3NH3BaI3 against humidity, unlike its lead halide counterpart, which degrades under such conditions.

We theoretically confirm this conjecture using a macroscopic hydrodynamic two-fluid description. Both, thermophoretic and elastic effects are included in this theory. Indeed, we find that the elasticity of the environment can cause the experimentally observed large-scale radial displacements in the embedding matrix. Additional experiments confirm the central role of elasticity.

Applying additional Gaussian white noise drives the system into a non-equilibrium steady state and causes a finite current if the potential is spatially asymmetric. We calculate the current explicitly in the three complementary limits. Since the particle current is driven solely by additive Gaussian white noise, this shows that the latter can potentially be exploited as a work resource to power small engines.

The physical properties of the anyon condensate that gives rise to the gapped interface are investigated. Remarkably, this condensate causes the gapped interface to behave as a type of anyon ""Andreev reflector"" in the bulk, whereby anyons from one phase, upon hitting the interface, can be transformed into a combination of reflected anyons and outgoing anyons from the other phase.

In a normal metal/insulator/ferromagnetic metal trilayer (such as Pt/oxide/Co), the spin transfer in general does not decay monotonically with the thickness of the insulator.

Narrower channels were found to possess a higher Schottky barrier height, which is ascribed to the edge-induced band bending in MoS2. The higher barrier heights degrade the transistor performance as a higher electrode-contact resistance. Theoretical analyses based on Poisson's equation showed that the edge-induced effect can be alleviated by a high dopant impurity concentration, but this strategy should be limited to channel widths of roughly 0.7 micrometers because of the impurity-induced charge-carrier mobility degradation. Therefore, proper termination of the dangling bonds at the edges should be necessary for aggressive scaling with layered semiconductors.",16,[],8

1605.09301,cond-mat,"The Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) is a state-of-the-art numerical technique for a one dimensional quantum many-body system; but calculating accurate results for a system with Periodic Boundary Condition (PBC) from the conventional DMRG has been a challenging job from the inception of DMRG. The recent development of the Matrix Product State (MPS) algorithm gives a new approach to find accurate results for the one dimensional PBC system. The most efficient implementation of the MPS algorithm can scale as O(equation), where equation can vary from 4 to equation. In this paper, we propose a new DMRG algorithm, which is very similar to the conventional DMRG and gives comparable accuracy to that of MPS. The computation effort of the new algorithm goes as O(equation) and the conventional DMRG code can be easily modified for the new algorithm.",16,[],8
1610.06253,cond-mat,"BaSnOequation (BSO) is a promising transparent conducting oxide (TCO) with reported room-temperature (RT) Hall mobility exceeding 320 cmequationVequationsequation. Among perovskite oxides, it has the highest RT mobility, about 30 times higher than that of the prototypical SrTiOequation. Using first-principles calculations based on hybrid density functional theory, we elucidate the physical mechanisms that govern the mobility by studying the details of LO-phonon and ionized impurity scattering. A careful numerical analysis to obtain converged results within the relaxation-time approximation of Boltzmann transport theory is presented. The equation dependence of the relaxation time is fully taken into account. We find that the high RT mobility in BSO originates not only from a small effective mass, but also from a significant reduction in the phonon scattering rate compared to other perovskite oxides; the origins of this reduction are identified. Ionized impurity scattering influences the total mobility even at RT for dopant densities larger than equation cmequation, and becomes comparable to LO-phonon scattering for equation cmequation doping, reducing the drift mobility from its intrinsic LO-phonon-limited value of equation594 cmequationVequationsequation to less than 310 cmequationVequationsequation. We suggest pathways to avoid impurity scattering via modulation doping or polar discontinuity doping. We also explicitly calculate the Hall factor and Hall mobility, allowing a direct comparison to experimental reports for bulk and thin films and providing insights into the nature of the dominant mechanisms that limit mobility in state-of-the art samples.",16,[],8
1601.00683,cond-mat,"It is common for dispersion curves of damped periodic materials to be based on real frequencies versus complex wavenumbers or, conversely, real wavenumbers versus complex frequencies. The former condition corresponds to harmonic wave motion where a driving frequency is prescribed and where attenuation due to dissipation takes place only in space alongside spatial attenuation due to Bragg scattering. The latter condition, on the other hand, relates to free wave motion admitting attenuation due to energy loss only in time while spatial attenuation due to Bragg scattering also takes place. Here, we develop an algorithm for 1D systems that provides dispersion curves for damped free wave motion based on frequencies and wavenumbers that are permitted to be simultaneously complex. This represents a generalized application of Bloch's theorem and produces a dispersion band structure that fully describes all attenuation mechanisms, in space and in time. The algorithm is applied to a viscously damped mass-in-mass metamaterial exhibiting local resonance. A frequency-dependent effective mass for this damped infinite chain is also obtained.",16,[],8

The Dirac-cone surface state is well isolated from the bulk bands, and the surface chemical potential is variable in the entire band-gap range. Tl0.5Bi2Te3 thus provides an excellent platform to realize two-dimensional topological superconductivity through a proximity effect from the superconducting bulk.

1601.02999,cond-mat,"Existing theoretical models of the interfacial thermal conductance, i.e., Kapitza conductance, of insulating solid-fluid interfaces only consider bulk properties, e.g., acoustic mismatch model and diffuse mismatch model. In this work, we propose a classical lattice dynamical model calculation of the Kapitza conductance, thereby incorporating interfacial structural details. In our model, we assume that heat is mostly carried by phonons in the solid, and that sound waves carry diffusive heat from the interface into the bulk of the liquid, where both longitudinal and transverse sound waves are considered. Sound wave dispersion is calculated from the fluid pair distribution function, evaluated using approximate integral equation theories (i.e., Percus-Yevick, Hypernetted-chain approximation). The Kapitza conductance of the solid-fluid interface is obtained from the phonon transmission coefficient at the interface. We determine the interfacial phonon transmission coefficient by solving the coupled equations of motion for the interfacial solid and fluid atoms. As an illustrative example, we derive the Kapitza conductance of solid argon-fluid neon interface, with pair-wise Lennard-Jones interactions.",16,[],8
1608.00194,cond-mat,"Semiconductor compounds are widely used for water splitting applications, where photo-generated electron-hole pairs are exploited to induce catalysis. Recently, powders of a metallic oxide (SrequationNbOequation, 0.03 < x < 0.20) have shown competitive photocatalytic efficiency, opening up the material space available for finding optimizing performance in water-splitting applications. The origin of the visible light absorption in these powders was reported to be due to an interband transition and the charge carrier separation was proposed to be due to the high carrier mobility of this material. In the current work we have prepared epitaxial thin films of SrequationNbOequation and found that the bandgap of this material is ~4.1 eV, which is very large. Surprisingly the carrier density of the conducting phase reaches 10equation cmequation, which is only one order smaller than that of elemental metals and the carrier mobility is only 2.47 cmequation/(Vequations). Contrary to earlier reports, the visible light absorption at 1.8 eV (~688 nm) is due to the bulk plasmon resonance, arising from the large carrier density, instead of an interband transition. Excitation of the plasmonic resonance results in a multifold enhancement of the lifetime of charge carriers. Thus we propose that the hot charge carriers generated from decay of plasmons produced by optical absorption is responsible for the water splitting efficiency of this material under visible light irradiation.",16,[],8

This is especially problematic for monolayers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), which are promising candidates for atomically thin electronics. Ideal electrical contacts to them would require the use of similarly thin electrode materials while maintaining low contact resistances. Here we report a scalable method to fabricate ohmic graphene edge contacts to two representative monolayer TMDs - MoS2 and WS2. The graphene and TMD layer are laterally connected with wafer-scale homogeneity, no observable overlap or gap, and a low average contact resistance of 30 kequation equationm.

Both models are treated using density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Upon increasing the density of rods in the monolayer, there is a continuous ordering of the rods along the monolayer normal (""standing up"" transition). The continuous transition also persists in the case of an external potential which favors flat--lying rods in the monolayer. This behavior is found in both the lattice and the continuum model. For the lattice model, we find very good agreement between the results from the specific DFT used (lattice fundamental measure theory) and simulations.

The joint investigations of the high-pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction and electrical transport properties reveal that the re-emergence of superconductivity in SrequationBiequationSeequation is closely related to the structural phase transition from ambient rhombohedral phase to high-pressure monoclinic phase around 6 GPa, and further to another high-pressure tetragonal phase above 25 GPa.",16,[],8
1601.06189,cond-mat,"Segregation-induced structural transitions in metallic grain boundaries are studied with hybrid atomistic Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulations using Cu-Zr as a model system, with a specific emphasis on understanding the effect of grain boundary character. With increasing global composition, the six grain boundary types chosen for this study first form ordered complexions, with the local segregation pattern depending on the grain boundary core structure, then transform into disordered complexions when the grain boundary composition reaches a critical value that is temperature dependent. The tendency for this transition to a disordered interfacial structure consistently depends on the relative solute excess, instead of the grain boundary energy or misorientation angle. Grain boundaries with high relative solute excess go through gradual disordering transitions, whereas those with low relative solute excess remain ordered until high global Zr concentrations but then abruptly transform into thick disordered films. The results presented here provide a clear picture of the effect of interface character on both dopant segregation patterns and disordered intergranular film formation, showing that all grain boundaries are not equal when discussing complexion transitions.",16,[],8

Here, we study the effect of the TDA on exciton binding energies of solids obtained from the Casida equation using long-range corrected (LRC) exchange-correlation kernels. We find that the TDA underestimates TDDFT-LRC exciton binding energies of semiconductors slightly, but those of insulators significantly (i.e., by more than 100%), and thus it is essential to solve the full Casida equation to describe strongly bound excitons. These findings are relevant in the ongoing search for accurate and efficient TDDFT approaches for excitons.",16,[],8
1610.06505,cond-mat,"The electric polarization hysteresis loops and remanent polarization were revealed in multiferroics RMnequationOequation with equation and equation at wide temperature interval from 5 K up to 330 K. Until recently, the long-range ferroelectric order having an exchange-striction magnetic nature had been observed in RMnequationOequation only at low temperatures (equation -- 35 K). We believe that the polarization we observed was caused by the frozen superparaelectric state which was formed by the restricted polar domains resulting from phase separation and charge carriers self-organization. At some sufficiently high temperatures equation the frozen superparaelectric state was destroyed, and the conventional superparaelectric state occurred. This happened when the potential barriers of the restricted polar domain reorientations become equal to the kinetic energy of the itinerant electrons (leakage). The hysteresis loops were measured by the so-called PUND method which allowed us to correctly subtract the contribution of conductivity from the measured polarization. The correlations between properties of the phase separation domains and polarization were revealed and studied. The high-temperature polarization also had a magnetic nature and was controlled by the magnetic field because the double exchange between pairs of Mn ions with different valences (Mnequation and Mnequation) in RMnequationOequation was the basic interaction resulting in phase separation.",16,[],8

1608.06058,cond-mat,"Stabilizing superconductivity at high temperatures and elucidating its mechanism have long been major challenges of materials research in condensed matter physics. Meanwhile, recent progress in nanostructuring offers unprecedented possibilities for designing novel functionalities. Above all, thin films of cuprate and iron-based high-temperature superconductors exhibit remarkably better superconducting characteristics (e.g. higher critical temperatures) than in the bulk, but the underlying mechanism is still not understood. Solving microscopic models suitable for cuprates, here, we demonstrate that at an interface between a Mott insulator and an overdoped non-superconducting metal, the superconducting amplitude stays always pinned at the optimum achieved in the bulk, independently of the carrier concentration in the metal. This is in contrast to the dome-like dependence in bulk superconductors, but consistent with the astonishing independence of the critical temperature from the carrier density x observed at interfaces of La2CuO4 and La2-xSrxCuO4. We furthermore identify a self-organization mechanism as responsible for the pinning at the optimum amplitude: An emergent electronic structure induced by interlayer phase separation eludes bulk phase separation and inhomogeneities that would kill superconductivity in the bulk. Thus, interfaces provide an ideal tool to enhance and stabilize superconductivity. This interfacial example opens up further ways of shaping superconductivity by suppressing competing instabilities, with direct perspectives for designing devices.",16,[],8

Preferential partitioning into the former decreases the miscibility temperature, while preferential partitioning into the latter causes an increase.

1604.03481,cond-mat,"Here we embark on a thorough investigation of the magneto-optical absorption in semiconducting \em spherical quantum dots characterized by a confining harmonic potential and an applied magnetic field in the symmetric gauge. This is done within the framework of Bohm-Pines' random-phase approximation that enables us to derive and discuss the full Dyson equation that takes proper account of the Coulomb interactions. As an application of our theoretical strategy, we compute various single-particle and many-particle phenomena such as the Fock-Darwin spectrum; Fermi energy; magneto-optical transitions; probability distribution; and the magneto-optical absorption in the quantum dots. It is observed that the role of an applied magnetic field on the absorption spectrum is comparable to that of a confining potential. Increasing (decreasing) the strength of the magnetic field or the confining potential is found to be analogous to shrinking (expanding) the size of the quantum dots: resulting into a blue (red) shift in the absorption spectrum. The Fermi energy diminishes with both increasing magnetic-field and dot-size; and exhibits saw-tooth-like oscillations at large values of field or dot-size. Unlike laterally confined quantum dots, both (upper and lower) magneto-optical transitions survive even in the extreme instances. However, the intra-Landau level transitions are seen to be forbidden. The spherical quantum dots have an edge over the strictly two-dimensional quantum dots in that the additional (magnetic) quantum number makes the physics richer (but complex).

This intriguing invariance of band structure with respect to geometrical variations can be attributed to a complete screening of [CaequationN]equation cationic layers by anionic excess electrons delocalized between the cationic layers. The resulting weak interactions between 2D dressed cationic layers give rise to not only a shallow potential barrier for bilayer sliding but also an electron-doping facilitated shear exfoliation.

Nanowires were prepared from films of niobium nitride with a thickness of 5 nm. For specimens with each layout we measured the spectra of the single-photon response in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 1600 nm and defined the cut-off wavelength equation beyond which the response rolls off.

Our calculations show that G0W0 leads to band gaps that agree well with experiment for the case of simple s-p electron systems, whereas scGW is required for improving the band gaps in 3-d electron systems. In addition, GW0 almost always predicts larger band gap values compared to scGW, likely due to the substantial underestimation of screening effects. Both the CPE method and Pade approximation lead to similar band gaps for most systems except strontium titantate, suggesting further investigation into the latter approximation is necessary for strongly correlated systems. Our computed band gaps serve as important benchmarks for the accuracy of the Matsubara-time GW approach.",16,[],8

The obtained nonlocal corrections to DMFT yield a decrease of the Curie temperature of the equation phase, leading to an agreement with its experimental value. We show that the corresponding nonlocal corrections to the energy of the equation phase are crucially important to obtain the proximity of energies of equation and equation phases in the vicinity of the iron equation-equation transformation.",16,[],8
1609.07111,cs,"The concept of ""logical depth"" introduced by Charles H. Bennett (1988) seems to capture, at least partially, the notion of organized complexity, so central in big history. More precisely, the increase in organized complexity refers here to the wealth, variety and intricacy of structures, and should not be confused with the increase of random complexity, formalized by Kolmogorov (1965). If Bennett is right in proposing to assimilate organized complexity with ""computational content"", then the fundamental cause of the increase of complexity in the universe is the existence of computing mechanisms with memory, and able to cumulatively create and preserve computational contents. In this view, the universe computes, remembers its calculations, and reuses them to conduct further computations. Evolutionary mechanisms are such forms of cumulative computation with memory and we owe them the organized complexity of life. Language, writing, culture, science and technology can also be analyzed as computation mechanisms generating, preserving and accelerating the increase in organized complexity. The main unifying theme for big history is the energy rate density, a metric based on thermodynamics. However useful, this metric does not provide much insight into the role that information and computation play in our universe. The concept of ""logical depth"" provides a new lens to examine the increase of organized complexity. We argue in this paper that organized complexity is a valid and useful way to make sense of big history. Additionally, logical depth has a rigorous formal definition in theoretical computer science that hints at a broader research program to quantify complexity in the universe.

1607.01046,cs,"The emergence of Linked Data on the WWW has spawned research interest in an online execution of declarative queries over this data. A particularly interesting approach is traversal-based query execution which fetches data by traversing data links and, thus, is able to make use of up-to-date data from initially unknown data sources. The downside of this approach is the delay before the query engine completes a query execution. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing an approach to return as many elements of the result set as soon as possible. The basis of this approach is a traversal strategy that aims to fetch result-relevant data as early as possible. The challenge for such a strategy is that the query engine does not know a priori which of the data sources that will be discovered during the query execution contain result-relevant data. We introduce 16 different traversal approaches and experimentally study their impact on response times. Our experiments show that some of the approaches can achieve significant improvements over the baseline of looking up URIs on a first-come, first-served basis. Additionally, we verify the importance of these approaches by showing that typical query optimization techniques that focus solely on the process of constructing the query result cannot have any significant impact on the response times of traversal-based query executions.",16,[],7

In particular, the blockchain community has been looking for ways to effectively integrate traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols into a blockchain consensus layer allowing various financial institutions to securely agree on the order of transactions. However, existing BFT protocols can only scale to tens of nodes due to their equation message complexity.   In this paper, we propose FastBFT, a fast and scalable BFT protocol. At the heart of FastBFT is a novel message aggregation technique that combines hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) with lightweight secret sharing primitives. Combining this technique with several other optimizations (i.e., optimistic execution, tree topology and failure detection), FastBFT achieves low latency and high throughput even for large scale networks. Via systematic analysis and experiments, we demonstrate that FastBFT has better scalability and performance than previous BFT protocols.",16,[],7
1603.09460,cs,"For text-independent short-utterance speaker recognition (SUSR), the performance often degrades dramatically. This paper presents a combination approach to the SUSR tasks with two phonetic-aware systems: one is the DNN-based i-vector system and the other is our recently proposed subregion-based GMM-UBM system. The former employs phone posteriors to construct an i-vector model in which the shared statistics offers stronger robustness against limited test data, while the latter establishes a phone-dependent GMM-UBM system which represents speaker characteristics with more details. A score-level fusion is implemented to integrate the respective advantages from the two systems. Experimental results show that for the text-independent SUSR task, both the DNN-based i-vector system and the subregion-based GMM-UBM system outperform their respective baselines, and the score-level system combination delivers performance improvement.",16,[],7

1609.02640,cs,"We consider capacitated vertex cover with hard capacity constraints (VC-HC) on hypergraphs. In this problem we are given a hypergraph equation with a maximum edge size equation. Each edge is associated with a demand and each vertex is associated with a weight (cost), a capacity, and an available multiplicity. The objective is to find a minimum-weight vertex multiset such that the demands of the edges can be covered by the capacities of the vertices and the multiplicity of each vertex does not exceed its available multiplicity.   In this paper we present an equation bi-approximation for VC-HC that gives a trade-off on the number of augmented multiplicity and the cost of the resulting cover. In particular, we show that, by augmenting the available multiplicity by a factor of equation, a~cover with a cost ratio of equation to the optimal cover for the original instance can be obtained. This improves over a previous result, which has a cost ratio of equation via augmenting the available multiplicity by a factor of equation.",16,[],7
1601.07576,cs,"Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have recently achieved remarkable successes in various image classification and understanding tasks. The deep features obtained at the top fully-connected layer of the CNN (FC-features) exhibit rich global semantic information and are extremely effective in image classification. On the other hand, the convolutional features in the middle layers of the CNN also contain meaningful local information, but are not fully explored for image representation. In this paper, we propose a novel Locally-Supervised Deep Hybrid Model (LS-DHM) that effectively enhances and explores the convolutional features for scene recognition. Firstly, we notice that the convolutional features capture local objects and fine structures of scene images, which yield important cues for discriminating ambiguous scenes, whereas these features are significantly eliminated in the highly-compressed FC representation. Secondly, we propose a new Local Convolutional Supervision (LCS) layer to enhance the local structure of the image by directly propagating the label information to the convolutional layers. Thirdly, we propose an efficient Fisher Convolutional Vector (FCV) that successfully rescues the orderless mid-level semantic information (e.g. objects and textures) of scene image. The FCV encodes the large-sized convolutional maps into a fixed-length mid-level representation, and is demonstrated to be strongly complementary to the high-level FC-features. Finally, both the FCV and FC-features are collaboratively employed in the LSDHM representation, which achieves outstanding performance in our experiments. It obtains 83.75% and 67.56% accuracies respectively on the heavily benchmarked MIT Indoor67 and SUN397 datasets, advancing the stat-of-the-art substantially.",16,[],7
1610.04770,cs,"The problem of source localization with ad hoc microphone networks in noisy and reverberant enclosures, given a training set of prerecorded measurements, is addressed in this paper. The training set is assumed to consist of a limited number of labelled measurements, attached with corresponding positions, and a larger amount of unlabelled measurements from unknown locations. However, microphone calibration is not required. We use a Bayesian inference approach for estimating a function that maps measurement-based feature vectors to the corresponding positions. The central issue is how to combine the information provided by the different microphones in a unified statistical framework. To address this challenge, we model this function using a Gaussian process with a covariance function that encapsulates both the connections between pairs of microphones and the relations among the samples in the training set. The parameters of the process are estimated by optimizing a maximum likelihood (ML) criterion. In addition, a recursive adaptation mechanism is derived where the new streaming measurements are used to update the model. Performance is demonstrated for 2-D localization of both simulated data and real-life recordings in a variety of reverberation and noise levels.",16,[],7

Accessing L1 caches beside the cores are the fastest after registers but the size of private caches cannot increase because of design, cost and technology limits. Then split I-cache and D-cache are used with shared LLC (last level cache). For a unified shared LLC, bus interface is not scalable, and it seems that distributed shared LLC (DSLLC) is a better choice. Most of papers assume a distributed shared LLC beside each core in on-chip network. Many works assume that DSLLCs are placed in all cores; however, we will show that this design ignores the effect of traffic congestion in on-chip network. In fact, our work focuses on optimal placement of cores, DSLLCs and even memory controllers to minimize the expected latency based on traffic load in a mesh on-chip network with fixed number of cores and total cache capacity. We try to do some analytical modeling deriving intended cost function and then optimize the mean delay of the on-chip network communication.

1608.00293,cs,"The primary goal in this thesis is to identify better syntactic constraint or bias, that is language independent but also efficiently exploitable during sentence processing. We focus on a particular syntactic construction called center-embedding, which is well studied in psycholinguistics and noted to cause particular difficulty for comprehension. Since people use language as a tool for communication, one expects such complex constructions to be avoided for communication efficiency. From a computational perspective, center-embedding is closely relevant to a left-corner parsing algorithm, which can capture the degree of center-embedding of a parse tree being constructed. This connection suggests left-corner methods can be a tool to exploit the universal syntactic constraint that people avoid generating center-embedded structures. We explore such utilities of center-embedding as well as left-corner methods extensively through several theoretical and empirical examinations.   Our primary task is unsupervised grammar induction. In this task, the input to the algorithm is a collection of sentences, from which the model tries to extract the salient patterns on them as a grammar. This is a particularly hard problem although we expect the universal constraint may help in improving the performance since it can effectively restrict the possible search space for the model. We build the model by extending the left-corner parsing algorithm for efficiently tabulating the search space except those involving center-embedding up to a specific degree. We examine the effectiveness of our approach on many treebanks, and demonstrate that often our constraint leads to better parsing performance. We thus conclude that left-corner methods are particularly useful for syntax-oriented systems, as it can exploit efficiently the inherent universal constraints in languages.",16,[],7

In contrast to existing methods which treat meshes as 3D polyhedra and try to partition the faces at their exact intersection curves, we treat meshes as adaptive surfaces which can be arbitrarily refined. Rather than depending on computing precise face intersections, our approach refines the input meshes in the intersection regions, then discards intersecting triangles and fills the resulting holes with high-quality triangles. The original intersection curves are approximated to a user-definable precision, and our method can identify and preserve creases and sharp features. Advantages of our approach include the ability to trade speed for accuracy, support for open meshes, and the ability to incorporate tolerances to handle cases where large numbers of faces are slightly inter-penetrating or near-coincident.",16,[],7
1608.00788,cs,"Online ranker evaluation is a key challenge in information retrieval. An important task in the online evaluation of rankers is using implicit user feedback for inferring preferences between rankers. Interleaving methods have been found to be efficient and sensitive, i.e. they can quickly detect even small differences in quality. It has recently been shown that multileaving methods exhibit similar sensitivity but can be more efficient than interleaving methods. This paper presents empirical results demonstrating that existing multileaving methods either do not scale well with the number of rankers, or, more problematically, can produce results which substantially differ from evaluation measures like NDCG. The latter problem is caused by the fact that they do not correctly account for the similarities that can occur between rankers being multileaved. We propose a new multileaving method for handling this problem and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms existing methods, in some cases reducing errors by as much as 50%.",16,[],7
1607.02318,cs,"This report makes the case that a well-designed Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) can match, and even exceed, the performance and code density of existing commercial Complex Instruction Set Computers (CISC) while maintaining the simplicity and cost-effectiveness that underpins the original RISC goals.   We begin by comparing the dynamic instruction counts and dynamic instruction bytes fetched for the popular proprietary ARMv7, ARMv8, IA-32, and x86-64 Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs) against the free and open RISC-V RV64G and RV64GC ISAs when running the SPEC CINT2006 benchmark suite. RISC-V was designed as a very small ISA to support a wide range of implementations, and has a less mature compiler toolchain. However, we observe that on SPEC CINT2006 RV64G executes on average 16% more instructions than x86-64, 3% more instructions than IA-32, 9% more instructions than ARMv8, but 4% fewer instructions than ARMv7.   CISC x86 implementations break up complex instructions into smaller internal RISC-like micro-ops, and the RV64G instruction count is within 2% of the x86-64 retired micro-op count. RV64GC, the compressed variant of RV64G, is the densest ISA studied, fetching 8% fewer dynamic instruction bytes than x86-64. We observed that much of the increased RISC-V instruction count is due to a small set of common multi-instruction idioms.   Exploiting this fact, the RV64G and RV64GC effective instruction count can be reduced by 5.4% on average by leveraging macro-op fusion. Combining the compressed RISC-V ISA extension with macro-op fusion provides both the densest ISA and the fewest dynamic operations retired per program, reducing the motivation to add more instructions to the ISA. This approach retains a single simple ISA suitable for both low-end and high-end implementations, where high-end implementations can boost performance through microarchitectural techniques.",16,[],7

In this paper, we aim at accelerating the current SRCNN, and propose a compact hourglass-shape CNN structure for faster and better SR. We re-design the SRCNN structure mainly in three aspects. First, we introduce a deconvolution layer at the end of the network, then the mapping is learned directly from the original low-resolution image (without interpolation) to the high-resolution one. Second, we reformulate the mapping layer by shrinking the input feature dimension before mapping and expanding back afterwards. Third, we adopt smaller filter sizes but more mapping layers. The proposed model achieves a speed up of more than 40 times with even superior restoration quality. Further, we present the parameter settings that can achieve real-time performance on a generic CPU while still maintaining good performance.

1607.03401,cs,"In crowdsourced preference aggregation, it is often assumed that all the annotators are subject to a common preference or utility function which generates their comparison behaviors in experiments. However, in reality annotators are subject to variations due to multi-criteria, abnormal, or a mixture of such behaviors. In this paper, we propose a parsimonious mixed-effects model based on HodgeRank, which takes into account both the fixed effect that the majority of annotators follows a common linear utility model, and the random effect that a small subset of annotators might deviate from the common significantly and exhibits strongly personalized preferences. HodgeRank has been successfully applied to subjective quality evaluation of multimedia and resolves pairwise crowdsourced ranking data into a global consensus ranking and cyclic conflicts of interests. As an extension, our proposed methodology further explores the conflicts of interests through the random effect in annotator specific variations. The key algorithm in this paper establishes a dynamic path from the common utility to individual variations, with different levels of parsimony or sparsity on personalization, based on newly developed Linearized Bregman Algorithms with Inverse Scale Space method. Finally the validity of the methodology are supported by experiments with both simulated examples and three real-world crowdsourcing datasets, which shows that our proposed method exhibits better performance (i.e. smaller test error) compared with HodgeRank due to its parsimonious property.",16,[],7
1609.07304,cs,"Multi-view face detection in open environment is a challenging task due to diverse variations of face appearances and shapes. Most multi-view face detectors depend on multiple models and organize them in parallel, pyramid or tree structure, which compromise between the accuracy and time-cost. Aiming at a more favorable multi-view face detector, we propose a novel funnel-structured cascade (FuSt) detection framework. In a coarse-to-fine flavor, our FuSt consists of, from top to bottom, 1) multiple view-specific fast LAB cascade for extremely quick face proposal, 2) multiple coarse MLP cascade for further candidate window verification, and 3) a unified fine MLP cascade with shape-indexed features for accurate face detection. Compared with other structures, on the one hand, the proposed one uses multiple computationally efficient distributed classifiers to propose a small number of candidate windows but with a high recall of multi-view faces. On the other hand, by using a unified MLP cascade to examine proposals of all views in a centralized style, it provides a favorable solution for multi-view face detection with high accuracy and low time-cost. Besides, the FuSt detector is alignment-aware and performs a coarse facial part prediction which is beneficial for subsequent face alignment.

By optimising on the pattern by which insertions and extractions occur during the Hensel lifting phase of the polytope method, we are able to obtain an adaptive Funnel Heap that minimises all of the work, cache, and space complexity of this phase. Additionally, we conduct a detailed empirical study confirming the superiority of Funnel Heap over the generic Binary Heap once swaps to external memory begin to take place. We demonstrate that Funnel Heap is a more efficient merger than the cache oblivious k-merger, which fails to achieve its optimal (and amortised) cache complexity when used for performing sums of products.

1604.08269,cs,"The accuracy of information retrieval systems is often measured using complex loss functions such as the average precision (AP) or the normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG). Given a set of positive and negative samples, the parameters of a retrieval system can be estimated by minimizing these loss functions. However, the non-differentiability and non-decomposability of these loss functions does not allow for simple gradient based optimization algorithms. This issue is generally circumvented by either optimizing a structured hinge-loss upper bound to the loss function or by using asymptotic methods like the direct-loss minimization framework. Yet, the high computational complexity of loss-augmented inference, which is necessary for both the frameworks, prohibits its use in large training data sets. To alleviate this deficiency, we present a novel quicksort flavored algorithm for a large class of non-decomposable loss functions. We provide a complete characterization of the loss functions that are amenable to our algorithm, and show that it includes both AP and NDCG based loss functions. Furthermore, we prove that no comparison based algorithm can improve upon the computational complexity of our approach asymptotically.

1609.06038,cs,"Reasoning and inference are central to human and artificial intelligence. Modeling inference in human language is very challenging. With the availability of large annotated data (Bowman et al., 2015), it has recently become feasible to train neural network based inference models, which have shown to be very effective. In this paper, we present a new state-of-the-art result, achieving the accuracy of 88.6% on the Stanford Natural Language Inference Dataset. Unlike the previous top models that use very complicated network architectures, we first demonstrate that carefully designing sequential inference models based on chain LSTMs can outperform all previous models. Based on this, we further show that by explicitly considering recursive architectures in both local inference modeling and inference composition, we achieve additional improvement. Particularly, incorporating syntactic parsing information contributes to our best result---it further improves the performance even when added to the already very strong model.",16,[],7

1606.02409,cs,"In the standard formulation of mechanism design, a key assumption is that the designer has reliable information and technology to determine a prior distribution on types of the agents. In the meanwhile, as pointed out by the Wilson's Principle, a mechanism should reply as little as possible on the accuracy of prior type distribution. In this paper, we put forward a model to formalize and quantify this statement.   In our model, each agent has a type distribution. In addition, the agent can commit to a fake distribution and bids consistently and credibly with respect to the fake distribution (i.e., plays Bayes equilibrium under the fake distributions). We study the equilibria of the induced distribution-committing games in several well-known mechanisms. Our results can be summarized as follows: (1) the game induced by Myerson's auction under our model is strategically equivalent to the first price auction under the standard model. As a consequence, they are revenue-equivalent as well. (2) the second-price auction yields weakly better revenue than several reserve-based and virtual-value-based auctions, under our fake distribution model. These results echo the recent literature on prior-independent mechanism design.",16,[],7

To solve this problem, a network of communicating detection nodes is deployed to monitor the monolithic process. Each node consists of an estimator with partial observation of the system's state. The local estimator executes a distributed variation of the particle filtering algorithm using the partial sensor measurements and the fault progression model of the process. During the implementation of the algorithm, each node communicates with its neighbors by sharing pre-processed information. The communication topology is defined using graph theoretic tools. The information fusion between the neighboring nodes is performed by means of a distributed average consensus algorithm to ensure the agreement over the value of the local likelihood functions.

1611.03553,cs,"Inference in expressive probabilistic models is generally intractable, which makes them difficult to learn and limits their applicability. Sum-product networks are a class of deep models where, surprisingly, inference remains tractable even when an arbitrary number of hidden layers are present. In this paper, we generalize this result to a much broader set of learning problems: all those where inference consists of summing a function over a semiring. This includes satisfiability, constraint satisfaction, optimization, integration, and others. In any semiring, for summation to be tractable it suffices that the factors of every product have disjoint scopes. This unifies and extends many previous results in the literature. Enforcing this condition at learning time thus ensures that the learned models are tractable. We illustrate the power and generality of this approach by applying it to a new type of structured prediction problem: learning a nonconvex function that can be globally optimized in polynomial time. We show empirically that this greatly outperforms the standard approach of learning without regard to the cost of optimization.",16,[],7

In particular, we show that TPOT can design machine learning pipelines that provide a significant improvement over a basic machine learning analysis while requiring little to no input nor prior knowledge from the user.

1604.06884,cs,"We consider an asynchronous voting process on graphs which we call discordant voting, and which can be described as follows. Initially each vertex holds one of two opinions, red or blue say. Neighbouring vertices with different opinions interact pairwise. After an interaction both vertices have the same colour. The quantity of interest is T, the time to reach consensus , i.e. the number of interactions needed for all vertices have the same colour.   An edge whose endpoint colours differ (i.e. one vertex is coloured red and the other one blue) is said to be discordant. A vertex is discordant if its is incident with a discordant edge. In discordant voting, all interactions are based on discordant edges. Because the voting process is asynchronous there are several ways to update the colours of the interacting vertices. Push: Pick a random discordant vertex and push its colour to a random discordant neighbour. Pull: Pick a random discordant vertex and pull the colour of a random discordant neighbour. Oblivious: Pick a random endpoint of a random discordant edge and push the colour to the other end point.   We show that E(T), the expected time to reach consensus, depends strongly on the underlying graph and the update rule. For connected graphs on n vertices, and an initial half red, half blue colouring the following hold. For oblivious voting, E(T) =n2/4 independent of the underlying graph. For the complete graph Kn, the push protocol has E(T)= Theta(n log(n)), whereas the pull protocol has E(T)= Theta(2n). For the cycle Cn all three protocols have E(T) = Theta(n2). For the star graph however, the pull protocol has E(T)=O(n2), whereas the push protocol is slower with E(T) = Theta(n2 log(n)).   The wide variation in E(T) for the pull protocol is to be contrasted with the well known model of synchronous pull voting, for which E(T) = O(n) on many classes of expanders.",16,[],7
1605.06863,cs,"We target the problem of sparse 3D reconstruction of dynamic objects observed by multiple unsynchronized video cameras with unknown temporal overlap. To this end, we develop a framework to recover the unknown structure without sequencing information across video sequences. Our proposed compressed sensing framework poses the estimation of 3D structure as the problem of dictionary learning, where the dictionary is defined as an aggregation of the temporally varying 3D structures. Given the smooth motion of dynamic objects, we observe any element in the dictionary can be well approximated by a sparse linear combination of other elements in the same dictionary (i. e. self-expression). Moreover, the sparse coefficients describing a locally linear 3D structural interpolation reveal the local sequencing information. Our formulation optimizes a biconvex cost function that leverages a compressed sensing formulation and enforces both structural dependency coherence across video streams, as well as motion smoothness across estimates from common video sources. We further analyze the reconstructability of our approach under different capture scenarios, and its comparison and relation to existing methods.

However, an open challenge is how to not only steer models based on the dimensions or features of the data, but how to add dimensions or attributes to the data based on the domain expertise of the user. In this paper, we present a technique for inferring and appending dimensions onto the dataset based on the prior expertise of the user expressed via user interactions.

In existing systems, the background knowledge is the same for all examples; however, examples may be context-dependent. This means that some examples should be explained in the context of some information, whereas others should be explained in different contexts. In this paper, we capture this notion and present a context-dependent extension of the Learning from Ordered Answer Sets framework. In this extension, contexts can be used to further structure the background knowledge. We then propose a new iterative algorithm, ILASP2i, which exploits this feature to scale up the existing ILASP2 system to learning tasks with large numbers of examples.

In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to overcome challenges in video-based face recognition (VFR). First, to learn blur-robust face representations, we artificially blur training data composed of clear still images to account for a shortfall in real-world video training data. Using training data composed of both still images and artificially blurred data, CNN is encouraged to learn blur-insensitive features automatically. Second, to enhance robustness of CNN features to pose variations and occlusion, we propose a Trunk-Branch Ensemble CNN model (TBE-CNN), which extracts complementary information from holistic face images and patches cropped around facial components. TBE-CNN is an end-to-end model that extracts features efficiently by sharing the low- and middle-level convolutional layers between the trunk and branch networks.

Hence, the learning involves rewiring of the reservoir connections similar to structural plasticity observed in biological neural networks. The network connections can be stored as a connection matrix and updated in memory by using Address Event Representation (AER) protocols which are generally employed in neuromorphic systems. On investigating the 'pairwise separation property' we find that trained liquids provide 1.36 equation 0.18 times more inter-class separation while retaining similar intra-class separation as compared to random liquids. Moreover, analysis of the 'linear separation property' reveals that trained liquids are 2.05 equation 0.27 times better than random liquids.

1601.02705,cs,"There is a large variety of objects and appliances in human environments, such as stoves, coffee dispensers, juice extractors, and so on. It is challenging for a roboticist to program a robot for each of these object types and for each of their instantiations. In this work, we present a novel approach to manipulation planning based on the idea that many household objects share similarly-operated object parts. We formulate the manipulation planning as a structured prediction problem and learn to transfer manipulation strategy across different objects by embedding point-cloud, natural language, and manipulation trajectory data into a shared embedding space using a deep neural network. In order to learn semantically meaningful spaces throughout our network, we introduce a method for pre-training its lower layers for multimodal feature embedding and a method for fine-tuning this embedding space using a loss-based margin. In order to collect a large number of manipulation demonstrations for different objects, we develop a new crowd-sourcing platform called Robobarista. We test our model on our dataset consisting of 116 objects and appliances with 249 parts along with 250 language instructions, for which there are 1225 crowd-sourced manipulation demonstrations.

In order to implement autonomous navigation, algorithms are therefore desirable that use sensory equipment that is as small, low-weight, and low-power consuming as possible. In this paper, we propose a method for autonomous MAV navigation and exploration using a low-cost consumer-grade quadrocopter equipped with a monocular camera. Our vision-based navigation system builds on LSD-SLAM which estimates the MAV trajectory and a semi-dense reconstruction of the environment in real-time. Since LSD-SLAM only determines depth at high gradient pixels, texture-less areas are not directly observed so that previous exploration methods that assume dense map information cannot directly be applied. We propose an obstacle mapping and exploration approach that takes the properties of our semi-dense monocular SLAM system into account.

1606.09370,cs,"In recent years extracting relevant information from biomedical and clinical texts such as research articles, discharge summaries, or electronic health records have been a subject of many research efforts and shared challenges. Relation extraction is the process of detecting and classifying the semantic relation among entities in a given piece of texts. Existing models for this task in biomedical domain use either manually engineered features or kernel methods to create feature vector. These features are then fed to classifier for the prediction of the correct class. It turns out that the results of these methods are highly dependent on quality of user designed features and also suffer from curse of dimensionality. In this work we focus on extracting relations from clinical discharge summaries.

There is a critical value of the coupling parameter for existence of the marginally circular photon orbit outside the event horizon, which depends on the rotation parameter of black hole and the polarization direction of photons. As the value of coupling parameter is near the critical value, we find that the marginally circular photon orbit for the retrograde photon increases with the rotation parameter, which modifies a common feature of the marginally circular photon orbit in a rotating black hole spacetime since it always decreases monotonously with the rotation parameter in the case without Weyl coupling.

1604.05297,gr-qc,"This paper reports a study on the truncated Israel-Stewart formalism for bulk viscosity using the extended holographic Ricci dark energy (EHRDE), where the density of dark energy is given as a combination of the Hubble parameter and its derivative. The equations of motion are integrated and the resulting model is analysed under many aspects, including the state finder parameters and the generalised thermodynamics second law. Under the consideration that the universe is dominated by EHRDE the evolution equation for the bulk viscous pressure equation in the framework of the truncated Israel-Stewart theory has been taken as equation, where equation is the relaxation time and equation is the bulk viscosity coefficient. Considering effective pressure as a sum of thermodynamic pressure of EHRDE and bulk viscous pressure it has been observed that under the influence of bulk viscosity the EoS parameter equation is behaving like phantom i.e. equation. It has been observed that the magnitude of the effective pressure equation is decaying with time. We also investigated the case for a specific choice of scale factor namely equation. For this choice we have observed that a transition from quintessence to phantom is possible for the equation of state parameter. However, the equationCDM phase is not attainable by the statefinder trajectories for this choice.

In this paper, we present two prescriptions to compute post-Newtonian (PN) accurate inspiral templates for such binaries. First, we adapt and extend the post-circular scheme of Yunes \it et al. [Phys. Rev. D 80, 084001 (2009)] to obtain a Fourier-domain inspiral approximant that incorporates the effects of PN-accurate orbital eccentricity evolution. This results in a fully analytic frequency-domain inspiral waveform with Newtonian amplitude and 2PN order Fourier phase while incorporating eccentricity effects up to sixth order at each PN order. The importance of incorporating eccentricity evolution contributions to the Fourier phase in a PN consistent manner is also demonstrated. Second, we present an accurate and efficient prescription to incorporate orbital eccentricity into the quasi-circular time-domain \textttTaylorT4 approximant at 2PN order. New features include the use of rational functions in orbital eccentricity to implement the 1.5PN order tail contributions to the far-zone fluxes. This leads to closed form PN-accurate differential equations for evolving eccentric orbits and the resulting time-domain approximant is accurate and efficient to handle initial orbital eccentricities equation.

1606.00811,gr-qc,"This thesis presents recent studies on test scalar and vector fields around black holes. It is separated in two parts according to the asymptotic properties of the spacetime under study. In the first part, we investigate scalar and Proca fields on an asymptotically flat background. For the Proca field, we obtain a complete set of equations of motion in higher dimensional spherically symmetric backgrounds. These equations are solved numerically, both to compute Hawking radiation spectra and quasi-bound states. In the former case, we carry out a precise study of the longitudinal degrees of freedom induced by the field mass. This can be used to improve the model in the black hole event generators currently used at the Large Hadron Collider. Regarding quasi-bound states, we find arbitrarily long lived modes for a charged Proca field, as well as for a charged scalar field, in a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. The second part of this thesis presents research on superradiant instabilities of scalar and Maxwell fields on an asymptotically anti-de Sitter background. For the scalar case, we introduce a charge coupling between the field and the background, and show that superradiant instabilities do exist for all equation modes, in higher dimensions. For the Maxwell case, we first propose a general prescription to impose boundary conditions on the Kerr-anti-de Sitter spacetime, and obtain two Robin boundary conditions. Then these two conditions are implemented to study superradiant unstable modes and vector clouds. In particular, we find that the new branch of quasinormal modes may be unstable in a larger parameter space. Furthermore, the existence of vector clouds indicates that one may find a vector hairy black hole solution for the Einstein-Maxwell-anti-de Sitter system at the nonlinear level, which implies that, in such system, the Kerr-Newman-anti-de Sitter black hole is not a unique solution.",16,[],13

We find that the rotation axes of the spin in the two problems coincide only for a vanishing chiral angle, in which case the rotation angles coincide in the nonrelativistic limit, and also remain remarkably close in the relativistic regime. The result shows that in the nonrelativistic limit the interaction between the spin and a reflecting surface with nonchiral boundary conditions is completely contained in the Thomas precession effect, in conformity with the fact that these boundary conditions are equivalent to an infinite repulsive scalar potential outside the boundary. By contrast, in the ultrarelativistic limit the rotation angle in the quantum problem remains finite, while in the classical one the rotation angle diverges.

The analysis is based on proton-proton collisions collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data samples correspond to integrated luminosities of 71 and 44 inverse picobarns for y < 3 and 3.2 < y < 4.7, respectively. Jets are reconstructed with the anti-kt clustering algorithm for two jet sizes, R, of 0.7 and 0.4, in a phase space region covering jet pT up to 2 TeV and jet rapidity up to y = 4.7. Predictions of perturbative quantum chromodynamics at next-to-leading order precision, complemented with electroweak and nonperturbative corrections, are used to compute the absolute scale and the shape of the inclusive jet cross section. The cross section difference in R, when going to a smaller jet size of 0.4, is best described by Monte Carlo event generators with next-to-leading order predictions matched to parton showering, hadronisation, and multiparton interactions. In the phase space accessible with the new data, this measurement provides a first indication that jet physics is as well understood at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV as at smaller centre-of-mass energies.",16,[],12

A key question in any grand unified theory is whether it satisfies the experimental lower limits on proton partial lifetimes. In generic models, substantial fine-tuning is required among GUT-scale parameters to satisfy the limits. In the proposed model, the equation, equation, and equation Yukawa couplings contributing to fermion masses have restricted textures intended to give favorable results for proton lifetime, while still giving rise to a realistic fermion sector, without the need for fine-tuning, even for large equation, and for either type-I or type-II dominance in the neutrino mass matrix.   In this thesis, I investigate the above hypothesis at a strict numerical level of scrutiny; I obtain a valid fit for the entire fermion sector for both types of seesaw dominance, including equation in good agreement with the most recent data. For the case with type-II seesaw, I find that, using the Yukawa couplings fixed by the successful fermion sector fit, proton partial lifetime limits are readily satisfied for all but one of the pertinent decay modes for nearly arbitrary values of the triplet-Higgs mixing parameters, with the equation mode requiring a equation cancellation in order to satisfy its limit. I also find a maximum partial lifetime for that mode of equationyears. For the type-I seesaw case, I find that equation decay mode is satisfied for any values of the triplet mixing parameters giving no major enhancement, and all other modes are easily satisfied for arbitrary mixing values; I also find a maximum partial lifetime for equation of nearly equationyears, which is sub-dominant to gauge boson decay channels.",16,[],2

1602.01699,hep-ph,"A radiative natural SUSY spectrum are proposed in the deflected anomaly mediation scenario with general messenger-matter interactions. Due to the contributions from the new interactions, positive slepton masses as well as a large At term can naturally be obtained with either sign of deflection parameter and few messenger species (thus avoid the possible Landau pole problem). In this scenario, in contrast to the ordinary (radiative) natural SUSY scenario with under-abundance of dark matter (DM), the DM can be the mixed bino-higgsino and have the right relic density.

1610.01843,hep-ph,"Drell-Yan lepton pairs with finite transverse momentum are produced when the vector boson recoils against (multiple) parton emission(s), and is determined by QCD dynamics. At small transverse momentum, the fixed order predictions break down due to the emergence of large logarithmic contributions. This region can be studied via the equation distribution constructed from the energies of the leptons, or through the equation distribution that relies on the directions of the leptons. For sufficiently small transverse momentum, the equation observable can be measured experimentally with better resolution. We study the small equation and equation distributions up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative QCD. We compute the equation distributions for the fully inclusive production of lepton pairs via equation to NNLO and normalise them to the NNLO cross sections for inclusive equation production. We compare our predictions with the equation distribution measured by the ATLAS collaboration during LHC operation at 8 TeV. We find that at moderate to large values of equation, the NNLO effects are positive and lead to a substantial improvement in the theory-data comparison compared to next-to-leading order (NLO). At small values of equation and equation, the known large logarithmic enhancements emerge through and we identify the region where resummation is needed. We find an approximate relationship between the values of equation and equation where the large logarithms emerge and find perturbative consistency between the two observables.",16,[],2

We find that although the SUSY parameter space has been severely restrained by current experimental data, both the general MSSM and the natural-SUSY scenario can still alter equation with a magnitude sizable enough to be observed at future equation-factories (ILC, CEPC, FCC-ee, Super equation-factory) which produce equation equation-bosons. To be specific, assuming a precise measurement equation at FCC-ee, we can probe a right-handed stop up to 530 GeV through chargino-stop loops, probe a sbottom to 850 GeV through neutralino-sbottom loops and a charged Higgs to 770 GeV through the Higgs-top quark loops for a large equation.

The novelty of our computation is that it uses a completely different method by means of the mass insertion approximation which works with the electroweak interaction states instead of the usual 9 physical neutrino mass eigenstates of the inverse seesaw model. This method also allows us to write the analytical results explicitly in terms of the most relevant model parameters, that are the neutrino Yukawa coupling matrix equation and the right-handed mass matrix equation, which is very convenient for a phenomenological analysis. This equation matrix, being generically nondiagonal in flavor space, is the only responsible for the induced charged lepton flavor violating processes of our interest.

Due to the presence of a sizable wavefunction overlap in the extra dimension between the KK graviton and the radion, the KK graviton can decay largely into a pair of radions, each of which decays into a pair of collimated photons or photon-jets. Focusing on the setup where the KK graviton has suppressed couplings to the Higgs boson and fermions, we discuss the bounds on the light radion in the parameter space where the photon-jets are relevant. Moreover, we pursue the possibility of distinguishing the scenario from the case with direct photon contributions by the angular distributions of photons in the LHC Run 2. Roles of KK graviton and radion as mediators of dark matter interactions, extensions with brane kinetic terms and the model with a holographic composite Higgs are also addressed.",16,[],2
1612.02447,hep-ph,"The cosmological evolution of standard model Yukawa couplings may have major implications for baryogenesis. In particular, as highlighted recently, the CKM matrix alone could be the source of CP-violation during electroweak baryogenesis provided that the Yukawa couplings were large and varied during the electroweak phase transition. We provide a natural realisation of this idea in the context of Randall-Sundrum models and show that the geometrical warped approach to the fermion mass hierarchy may naturally display the desired cosmological dynamics. The key ingredient is the coupling of the Goldberger-Wise scalar, responsible for the IR brane stabilisation, to the bulk fermions, which modifies the fermionic profiles. This also helps alleviating the usually tight constraints from CP-violation in Randall-Sundrum scenarios. We study how the Yukawa couplings vary during the stabilisation of the Randall-Sundrum geometry and can thus induce large CP-violation during the electroweak phase transition. Using holography, we discuss the 4D interpretation of this dynamical interplay between flavour and electroweak symmetry breaking.",16,[],2

1608.01643,hep-ph,"In high-energy collisions the number of the created particles is far less than the thermodynamic limit, especially in small colliding systems (e.g. proton-proton).

As a consequence the characterization of identified hadron spectra with the Boltzmann\,--\,Gibbs thermodynamical approach is insufficient. Instead particle spectra measured in high-energy collisions can be described very well with Tsallis\,--\,Pareto distributions, derived from non-extensive thermodynamics. Using the Tsallis q-entropy formula, a generalization of the Boltzmann\,--\,Gibbs entropy, we interpret the microscopical physics by analysing the Tsallis equation and equation parameters. In this paper we give a quick overview on these parameters, analyzing identified hadron spectra from recent years in a wide center of mass energy range.

According to the residue theorem of Beasley and Witten, the non-perturbative superpotential must vanish in a large class of heterotic vacua because the contributions from curves in the same homology class cancel each other. We point out, however, that in certain cases the curves treated in the residue theorem as lying in the same homology class, can actually have different area with respect to the physical Kahler form and can be in different homology classes. In these cases, the residue theorem is not directly applicable and the structure of the superpotential is more subtle. We show, in a specific example, that the superpotential is non-zero both on \tildeX and on X. On the non-simply connected manifold X, we explicitly compute the leading contribution to the superpotential from all holomorphic, isolated, genus 0 curves with minimal area. The reason for the non-vanishing of the superpotental on X is that the second homology class contains a finite part called discrete torsion.

Also, the topological number of a kink in the central region changes in the contrast of saving full topological number. At lower excitation energies there is a long-living excited vibrational state of the kink; this phenomenon is the final stage of all considered initial states.

1602.06517,hep-th,"String theory axions are interesting candidates for fields whose potential might be controllable over super-Planckian field ranges and therefore as possible candidates for inflatons in large field inflation. Axion monodromy scenarios are setups where the axion shift symmetry is broken by some effect such that the axion can traverse a large number of periods potentially leading to super-Planckian excursions. We study such scenarios in type IIA string theory where the axion shift symmetry is broken by background fluxes. In particular we calculate the backreaction of the energy density induced by the axion vacuum expectation value on its own field space metric. We find universal behaviour for all the compactifications studied where up to a certain critical axion value there is only a small backreaction effect. Beyond the critical value the backreaction is strong and implies that the proper field distance as measured by the backreacted metric increases at best logarithmically with the axion vev, thereby placing strong limitations on extending the field distance any further. The critical axion value can be made arbitrarily large by the choice of fluxes. However the backreaction of these fluxes on the axion field space metric ensures a precise cancellation such that the proper field distance up to the critical axion value is flux independent and remains sub-Planckian. We also study an axion alignment scenario for type IIA compactifications on a twisted torus with four fundamental axions mixing to leave an axion with an effective decay constant which is flux dependent. There is a choice of fluxes for which the alignment parameter is unconstrained by tadpoles and can in principle lead to a parametrically enhanced effective decay constant.

To obtain such gauge invariant model, we have used the gauge unfixing method to construct a first-class NC version of the Proca model.

1609.04550,hep-th,"Entropy is a quantity for counting physical degrees of freedom in a system. At a finite temperature, one can use thermal entropy to study thermodynamical properties. At zero temperature, entanglement entropy is expected to provide a suitable order parameter of a phase structure. Especially, the entanglement entropy exhibits an interesting codimension two area law in a strongly coupled conformal field theory. We compute thermal entropy in a non-relativistic model with an infinite fermion mass limit from an exact effective potential to obtain thermal entropy at an infinite strong coupling limit. The computational result provides vanishing thermal entropy at an infinite strong coupling limit with a finite lattice spacing. The non-trivial topological term can be included in the strongly coupled lattice system to obtain the non-trivial entropy and the topology can be marked from the entropy. We first compute the thermal entropy in a two dimensional lattice topological quantum field theory to study the lattice artifact and also argue that a theory possibly has translational invariance if a system does not have a volume law in the entanglement entropy. Finally, we show that a coefficient of a universal term of the entanglement entropy should not be affected by a choice of an entangling surface in two dimensional conformal field theory for one interval case.

We calculate the pressure and two different non-perturbative vertices as functions of coupling and temperature. Our results show that the 4 loop contribution can become larger than the 3 loop term when the coupling is large. This indicates a breakdown of the 2PI approach, and the need for higher order equationPI approximations. In addition, our results demonstrate the renormalizability of 2PI calculations at the 4 loop level. This is interesting because the counterterm structure of the 2PI theory at 4 loops is different from the structure at equation loops.

However these two approaches give rise to the results that are not always consistent among themselves. In this paper we explore this problem. We show that in order to reconcile two methods the so-called discrete terms in the operator product expansion in the underlying Liouville theory must be properly taken into account.

For some graphs equation, the edit distance from equation is computed, where equation is the class of graphs which contain no induced copy of graph equation.   Those graphs for which we determine the edit distance asymptotically are equation, an equation-clique with equation isolated vertices, and equation, a complete bipartite graph.

More precisely, if the functional equation which controls the stopping condition of Spector's bar recursor is equation-definable, then the corresponding bar recursion of type levels equation and equation is already equation-definable. Schwichtenberg's original proof, however, relies on a detour through Tait's infinitary terms and the correspondence between ordinal recursion for equation and primitive recursion over finite types. This detour makes it hard to calculate on given concrete system equation input, what the corresponding system equation output would look like. In this paper we present an alternative (more direct) proof based on an explicit construction which we prove correct via a suitably defined logical relation. We show through an example how this gives a straightforward mechanism for converting bar recursive definitions into equation-definitions under the conditions of Schwichtenberg's theorem.

To achieve the distributed average tracking problem in the presence of nonlinear term, a non-smooth filter and a control input are designed for each agent. The idea is that each filter outputs converge to the average of the reference inputs and the reference velocities asymptotically and in parallel each agent's position and velocity are driven to track its filter outputs. To overcome the nonlinear term unboundedness effect, novel state-dependent time varying gains are employed in each agent's filter and control input. In the proposed algorithm, each agent needs its neighbors' filters outputs besides its own filter outputs, absolute position and absolute velocity and its neighbors' reference inputs and reference velocities.

1604.06941,math,"Sparsity is one of the key concepts that allows the recovery of signals that are subsampled at a rate significantly lower than required by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem.

In order to further exploit the sparsity of the recovered signal we combine the method of reweighted equation, introduced by Cand\`es et al., with iteratively updated weights accounting for the multilevel structure of the signal. This is done by directly incorporating this approach into a split Bregman based algorithmic framework. Furthermore, we add total generalized variation (TGV) as a second regularizer into the split Bregman algorithm. The resulting algorithm is then applied to a classical and widely considered task in signal- and image processing which is the reconstruction of images from their Fourier measurements.

1605.09264,nlin,"This Report discusses a recently developed concept of Limiting Phase Trajectories (LPTs) providing a unified description of resonant energy transport in a wide range of classical and quantum dynamical systems with constant and time-varying parameters. It is shown that strongly modulated non-stationary processes occurring in a nonlinear oscillator array under certain initial conditions may characterize either maximum possible energy exchange between the clusters of oscillators (effective particles) or maximum energy transfer from an external source of energy to the system. The trajectories corresponding to these processes are referred to as LPTs. The development and the use of the LPT concept are motivated by the fact that highly non-stationary resonance processes occurring in a broad variety of finite-dimensional physical models are beyond the well-known paradigm of the nonlinear normal modes (NNMs), fully justified only for stationary processes, their stability and bifurcations, as well as for non-stationary processes described approximately by some combinations of non-resonating normal modes. Thus, the role of LPTs in understanding and description of non-stationary energy transfer is similar to the role of NNMs for the stationary processes. Several applications of the LPT concept to significant nonlinear problems and a scenario of the transition from regular to chaotic behavior with the LPTs implication are presented. In order to highlight the novelty and perspectives of the developed approach, we place the LPT concept into the context of complex dynamical phenomena related to energy transfer problems.",16,[],9

We explore the effects of heterogeneous coupling phase-lags between the two populations. Such heterogeneity arises naturally in various settings, for example as an approximation to transmission delays, excitatory-inhibitory interactions, or as amplitude and phase responses of oscillators with electrical or mechanical coupling. We find that breaking the phase-lag symmetry results in a variety of states with uniform and non-uniform synchronization, including in-phase and anti-phase synchrony, full incoherence (splay state), chimeras with phase separation of equation or equation between populations, and states where both populations remain desynchronized. These desynchronized states exhibit stable, oscillatory, and even chaotic dynamics. Moreover, we identify the bifurcations through which chimeras emerge. Stable chimera states and desynchronized solutions, which do not arise for homogeneous phase-lag parameters, emerge as a result of competition between synchronized in-phase, anti-phase equilibria, and fully incoherent states when the phase-lags are near equation (cosine coupling).

Especially, it is interesting that a rogue wave is found to be aroused by the interaction between lump soliton and a pair of resonance stripe solitons. By choosing the values of the parameters, the dynamic properties of lump solution, interaction between lump soliton and one stripe soliton, rogue wave, generated by the interaction between lump soliton and a pair of resonance solitons, are shown graphically.",16,[],9
1611.10148,nlin,"It is well known that in some cases the spectral parameter has a group interpretation. We discuss in detail the case of Gauss-Codazzi equations for isothermic surfaces immersed in equation. The algebra of Lie point symmetries is 4-dimensional and all these symmetries are also symmetries of the Gaus-Weingarten equations (which can be considered as so(3)-valued non-parametric linear problem). In order to obtain a non-removable spectral parameter one has to consider so(4,1)-valued linear problem which has a 3-dimensional algebra of Lie point symmetries. The missing symmetry introduces a non-removable parameter. In the second part of the paper we extend these results on the case of isothermic immersions in arbitrary multidimensional Euclidean spaces. In order to simplify calculations the problem was formulated in terms of a Clifford algebra.",16,[],9
1609.06108,nlin,"A system of two Schnakenberg-like reaction-diffusion equations is investigated analytically and numerically. The system has previously been used as a minimal model for concentrations of GTPases involved in the process of cell polarisation. Source and loss terms are added, breaking the mass conservation, which was shown previously to be responsible for the generation of stable fronts via a so-called wave-pinning mechanism. The extended model gives rise to a unique homogeneous equilibrium in the parameter region of interest, which loses stability via a pattern formation, or Turing bifurcation. The bistable character of the reaction terms ensures that this bifurcation is subcrtical for sufficiently small values of the driving parameter multiplying the nonlinear kinetics. This subcriticality leads to the onset of a multitude of localised solutions, through the homoclinic snaking mechanism. As the driving parameter is further decreased, the multitude of solutions transforms into a single pulse through a Belyakov-Devaney transition in which there is the loss of a precursive pattern. An asymptotic analysis is used to probe the conservative limit in which the source and loss terms vanish. Matched asymptotic analysis shows that on an infinite domain the pulse solution transitions into a pair of fronts, with an additional weak quadratic core and exponential tails. On a finite domain, the core and tails disappear, leading to the mere wave-pinning front and its mirror image.",16,[],9

The Darboux transformation is generic in iterating a pair of generating solutions of the Lax-pair equation which preserves the solution of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation as a consistency condition. The Darboux transformation itself knows nothing about the background solution except through the initial pair of Lax solutions. Because of this, in this work, we can prove in an unified manner, and without knowing the analytical form of the background solution, that the peak-height of a high-order breather, is just a sum of peak-heights of first-order breathers plus that of the background, \it irrespective of the specific choice of the background.

The landau damping effect is further revealed by means of the linear stability analysis and resonance poles theory above the critical threshold which turns to be far more generic. Furthermore, the dimensionality reduction technique of the Ott-Antonsen is implemented to capture the analytical description of relaxation dynamics of the steady states valid on a globally attracting manifold.

1609.09354,nlin,"It is well known that chaotic dynamic systems (such as three-body system, turbulent flow and so on) have the sensitive dependance on initial conditions (SDIC). Unfortunately, numerical noises (such as truncation error and round-off error) always exist in practice. Thus, due to the SDIC, long-term accurate prediction of chaotic dynamic systems is practically impossible, and therefore numerical simulations of chaos are only mixtures of ""true"" solution with physical meanings and numerical noises without physical meanings. However, it is traditionally believed that statistic computations based on such kind of ""mixtures"" of numerical simulations of chaotic dynamic systems are acceptable. In this paper, using the so-called ""clean numerical simulation"" (CNS) whose numerical noises might be much smaller even than micro-level physical uncertainty and thus are negligible, we gain accurate prediction of a chaotic dynamic system in a long enough interval of time. Then, based on these reliable simulations, the influence of numerical noises on statistic computations is investigated. It is found that the influence of numerical noises is negligible when statistic results are time-independent. Unfortunately, when a chaotic dynamic system is far from equilibrium state so that its statistics are time-dependent, numerical noises have a great influence even on statistic computations. It suggests that even the direct numerical simulations (DNS) might not give reliable statistic computations for non-equilibrium dynamic systems with the SDIC.",16,[],9

By disrupting the paths, link temporality has been shown to frustrate many dynamical processes on networks, from information spreading to accessibility. Considering the ubiquity of temporal networks in nature, we must ask: Are there any advantages of the networks' temporality? Here we develop an analytical framework to explore the control properties of temporal networks, arriving at the counterintuitive conclusion that temporal networks, compared to their static (i.e. aggregated) counterparts, reach controllability faster, demand orders of magnitude less control energy, and the control trajectories, through which the system reaches its final states, are significantly more compact than those characterizing their static counterparts. The combination of analytical, numerical and empirical results demonstrates that temporality ensures a degree of flexibility that would be unattainable in static networks, significantly enhancing our ability to control them.",16,[],9

We focus on mechanical and structural systems where we usually avoid multistability for safety and reliability. We want to be sure that in the given range of parameters and initial conditions the expected solution is the only possible or at least has dominant basin of attraction. We propose an algorithm to estimate the probability of reaching the solution in given (accessible) ranges of initial conditions and parameters. We use a modified method of basin stability (Menck et. al., Nature Physics, 9(2) 2013). In our investigation we examine three different systems: a Duffing oscillator with a tuned mass absorber, a bilinear impacting oscillator and a beam with attached rotating pendula. We present the results that prove the usefulness of the proposed algorithm and highlight its strengths in comparison with classical analysis of nonlinear systems (analytical solutions, path-following, basin of attraction ect.). We show that with relatively small computational effort (comparing to classical analysis) we can predict the behaviour of the system and select the ranges in parameter's space where the system behaves in a presumed way. The method can be used in all types of nonlinear complex systems.",16,[],9
1609.05584,nlin,"We describe how the transition to synchronization in a system of globally coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators changes from continuous to discontinuous when the nature of the coupling is moved from diffusive to reactive. We explain this drastic qualitative change as resulting from the co-existence of a particular synchronized macrostate together with the trivial incoherent macrostate, in a range of parameter values for which the later is linearly stable. In contrast to the paradigmatic Kuramoto model, this particular state observed at the synchronization transition contains a finite, non-vanishing number of synchronized oscillators, which results in a discontinuous transition. We consider successively two situations where either a fully synchronized state or a partially synchronized state exist at the transition. Thermodynamic limit and finite size effects are briefly discussed, as well as connections with recently observed discontinuous transitions.",16,[],9

In this analysis we consider three different types of external trap potentials: a time-independent trap, a time-dependent monotonic trap, and a time-dependent periodic trap. We point out the existence of different interesting localized structures, namely rogue waves, dark-and bright soliton-rogue wave, and rogue wave-breather-like wave for the above three cases of trap potentials. We show how the vector localized density profiles in a constant background get deformed when we tune the strength of the trap parameter. Further we investigate the nature of the trajectories of the nonautonomous rogue waves. We also construct the dark-dark rogue wave solution for repulsive-repulsive interaction of two-component BECs and analyze the associated characteristics for the three different kinds of traps.

1604.00247,nlin,"It is well known that low-dimensional nonlinear deterministic maps close to a tangent bifurcation exhibit intermittency and this circumstance has been exploited, e.g. by Procaccia and Schuster [Phys. Rev. A 28, 1210 (1983)], to develop a general theory of 1/f spectra. This suggests it is interesting to study the extent to which the behavior of a high-dimensional stochastic system can be described by such tangent maps. The Tangled Nature (TaNa) Model of evolutionary ecology is an ideal candidate for such a study, a significant model as it is capable of reproducing a broad range of the phenomenology of macroevolution and ecosystems. The TaNa model exhibits strong intermittency reminiscent of Punctuated Equilibrium and, like the fossil record of mass extinction, the intermittency in the model is found to be non-stationary, a feature typical of many complex systems. We derive a mean-field version for the evolution of the likelihood function controlling the reproduction of species and find a local map close to tangency. This mean-field map, by our own local approximation, is able to describe qualitatively only one episode of the intermittent dynamics of the full TaNa model. To complement this result we construct a complete nonlinear dynamical system model consisting of successive tangent bifurcations that generates time evolution patterns resembling those of the full TaNa model in macroscopic scales. In spite of the limitations of our approach, that entails a drastic collapse of degrees of freedom, the description of a high-dimensional model system in terms of a low-dimensional one appears to be illuminating.",16,[],9

To do that, we model the exponent of the power law using a nonlinear function which depends on data and two parameters. Then, we provide some basic properties and some specific models of that new family of distributions. After that, we study a relevant model of the family, with special emphasis on the quantile and hazard functions, and the corresponding estimation and testing methods.

In this case the chaotic orbits around the origin are represented by analytic series (Moser series). We find the domain of convergence of these Moser series and of similar series around other unstable periodic orbits. The asymptotic manifolds from the various unstable periodic orbits intersect at homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits that are given analytically.

For the case of both Coulombic and gravitational versions, exact expressions of the Hamiltonian have been derived in rhombic coordinates. We simulate the phase-space evolution through an event-driven algorithm that utilizes analytic solutions to the equations of motion. The simulation results show that the motion exhibits chaotic, quasiperiodic, and periodic behaviors in segmented regions of the phase space. While there is no evidence of global chaos in either the Coulombic or the gravitational system, the former exhibits a transition from a completely non-chaotic phase space at low energies to a mixed behavior. Gradual yet striking transitions from mild to intense chaos are indicated with changing energy, a behavior that differentiates the spatially periodic systems studied in this paper from the well-understood free-boundary versions of the 3-body problem.

1602.05389,nucl-th,"Background: Heavy-ion fusion reactions at energies near the Coulomb barrier are influenced by couplings between the relative motion and nuclear intrinsic degrees of freedom of the colliding nuclei. The time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory, incorporating the couplings at the mean-field level, as well as the coupled-channels (CC) method are standard approaches to describe low energy nuclear reactions.   Purpose: To investigate the effect of couplings to inelastic and transfer channels on the fusion cross sections for the reactions equationCaequationNi and equationCaequationNi.   Methods: Fusion cross sections around and below the Coulomb barrier have been obtained from coupled-channels (CC) calculations, using the bare nucleus-nucleus potential calculated with the frozen Hartree-Fock method and coupling parameters taken from known nuclear structure data. The fusion thresholds and neutron transfer probabilities have been calculated with the TDHF method.   Results: For equationCaequationNi, the TDHF fusion threshold is in agreement with the most probable barrier obtained in the CC calculations including the couplings to the low-lying octupole equation state for equationCa and to the low-lying quadrupole equation state for equationNi. This indicates that the octupole and quadrupole states are the dominant excitations while neutron transfer is shown to be weak. For equationCaequationNi, the TDHF barrier is lower than predicted by the CC calculations including the same inelastic couplings as those for equationCaequationNi. TDHF calculations show large neutron transfer probabilities in equationCaequationNi which could result in a lowering of the fusion threshold.

The equationHe continuum is simulated by square-integrable positive-energy states. The model is based only on well known nucleon-target potentials, and is therefore does not depend on any adjustable parameter. I show that experimental elastic cross sections are fairly well reproduced. The calculation suggests that breakup effects increase for high target masses. For a light system such as equationHeequationAl, breakup effects are small, and a single-channel approximation provides fair results. This property is explained by a very simple model, based on the sharp-cut-off approximation for the scattering matrix.

1606.03345,nucl-th,"Proton radii of nuclei in the equation shell depart appreciably from the asymptotic law, equation. The departure exhibits systematic trends fairly well described by a single phenomenological term in the Duflo-Zuker formulation, which also happens to explain the sudden increase in slope in the isotope shifts of several chains at neutron number equation. It was recently shown that this term is associated with the abnormally large size of the equation and equation orbits in the equation and equation shells respectively. Further to explore the problem, we propose to calculate microscopically radii in the former. Since the (square) radius is basically a one body operator, its evolution is dictated by single particle occupancies determined by shell model calculations. Assuming that the departure from the asymptotic form is entirely due to the equation orbit, the expectation value equation is determined by demanding that its evolution be such as to describe well nuclear radii. It does, for an orbit that remains very large (about 1.6 fm bigger than its equation counterparts) up to equation then drops abruptly but remains some 0.6 fm larger than the equation orbits.

In this paper we calculate the near threshold cross section for the equation reaction by performing the convolution of the obtained operators with nuclear wave functions based on modern phenomenological and chiral potentials. The available chiral equation wave functions are constructed with a cutoff comparable with the momentum transfer scale inherent in pion production reactions. Hence, a significant portion of the dynamical intermediate-range physics is thereby cut off by them. On the other hand, the NNLO amplitudes evaluated with phenomenological wave functions appear to be largely independent of the equation model used and give corrections to the dominant leading order contributions as expected from dimensional analysis. The result gives support to the counting scheme used to classify the pion production operators, which is a precondition for a reliable investigation of the chirally suppressed neutral pion production.

The clusters of smaller sizes form two accompanying gases, which behave oppositely to their liquids. The liquid droplet formula is used to analyze the size distributions of the gas (anti)clusters. The fit of these distributions allows us to extract the temperature dependence of surface tension and the value of Fisher topological exponent equation for both kinds of gaseous clusters. It is shown that the surface tension coeficient of gaseous (anti)clusters can serve as an order parameter of the deconfinement phase transition in SU(2) gluodynamics. The Fisher topological exponent equation of (anti)clusters is found to have the same value equation.

It is found that in the low-temperature and high-density regime where the radius of convergence of the expansion is generically zero, the inclusion of higher-order terms beyond the leading quadratic approximation leads overall to a significantly poorer description of the isospin-asymmetry dependence. In contrast, at high temperatures and densities well below nuclear saturation density, the interaction contributions to the higher-order coefficients are negligible and the deviations from the quadratic approximation are predominantly from the noninteracting term in the many-body perturbation series. Furthermore, we extract the leading logarithmic term in the isospin-asymmetry expansion of the equation of state at zero temperature from the analysis of linear combinations of finite differences.

1608.02802,nucl-th,"Heavy even-even nuclei exhibit low-energy collective excitations that are separated in scale from the microscopic (fermion) degrees of freedom. This separation of scale allows us to approach nuclear vibrations within an effective field theory (EFT). In odd-mass nuclei collective and single-particle properties compete at low energies, and this makes their description more challenging. In this article we describe odd-mass nuclei with ground-state spin equation by means of an EFT that couples a fermion to the collective degrees of freedom of an even-even core. The EFT relates observables such as energy levels, electric quadrupole (equation) transition strengths, and magnetic dipole (equation) moments of the odd-mass nucleus to those of its even-even neighbor, and allows us to quantify theoretical uncertainties. For isotopes of rhodium and silver the theoretical description is consistent with data within experimental and theoretical uncertainties. Several testable predictions are made.",16,[],11
1608.02897,nucl-th,"We propose the use of neutron poisons in reactions induced by radioactive beams as a test of theoretical models aiming to relate neutron capture in nuclei with neutron surrogate reactions such as (d,p) reactions. We exploit the approximations necessary to obtain a direct relation between the two reactions; surrogate vs. neutron capture. We also show how this is intimately related to the momentum distribution of the neutron within the deuteron. The models we use are based on the theory of inclusive breakup reactions commonly employed in the treatment of incomplete fusion and surrogate method. Such theories were developed in the 80's by Ichimura, Autern and Vincent [Phys. Rev. C 32, 431 (1985)], Udagawa and Tamura [Phys. Rev. C 24, 1348 (1981)] and Hussein and McVoy [Nucl. Phys. A 445, 124 (1985)]. We use these theories to derive an expression for the proton yield in the reaction A(d,p)B. The capture reaction equation is then extracted using reasonable approximations. By recalling an old method proposed by Serber [Phys. Rev. 80, 1098 (1950); Nature 166, 709 (1950)] we explain how the momentum distribution of neutrons within the deuteron will depend on the short-range dependence of the nucleon-nucleon force. The relevance of our work to nucleosynthesis in the rapid neutron capture process is emphasized.",16,[],11
1609.02766,nucl-th,"Excited states in neutron-rich nuclei located south-east of equationSn are investigated by shell-model calculations. A new shell-model Hamiltonian is constructed for the present study. The proton-proton and neutron-neutron interactions of the Hamiltonian are obtained through the existing CD-Bonn equation matrix results, while the proton-neutron interaction across two major shells is derived from the monopole based universal interaction plus the M3Y spin-orbit force. The present Hamiltonian can reproduce well the experimental data available in this region, including one-neutron separation energies, level energies and the experimental equation values of isomers in equationSn, equationCd, and equationPd. New isomers are predicted in this region, equation in equationSn, equationCd, equationPd, equationIn and equationAg, in which almost no excited states are known experimentally yet. In the odd-odd equationIn and equationAg, the predicted very long equation life-times of the low-lying equation states are discussed, demanding more information on the related proton-neutron interaction. The low-lying states of equationIn are discussed in connection with the recently observed equation rays. The predicted equation isomer in equationPd could decay by both electromagnetic transitions and neutron emission with comparable partial life-times, making it a good candidate for neutron radioactivity, a decay mode which is yet to be discovered.",16,[],11

1612.08983,nucl-th,"In order to compare theoretical calculations of thermal fluctuations of conserved quantities, such as charge susceptibilities or the specific heat, to experimentally measured correlations and fluctuations in heavy ion collisions, one must confront the reality of changing conditions within the collision environment, and transport of conserved quantities within the finite duration of the expansion and dissolution of the reaction. In previous work, fluctuations of conserved charges from lattice calculations, where charge is allowed to fluctuate within the designated volume consistent with the grand canonical ensemble, was linked to correlations in heavy-ion collisions, which accounted for the finite time with which to transport absolutely conserved quanatities. In this case details of the correlations were related to the evolution of the susceptibility. In this work, this paradigm is extended to compare fluctuations of momentum or energy to transverse energy correlations that can be measured in heavy-ion collisions. The sensitivity of these correlations to the equation of state, viscosity and diffusion is illustrated by considering simple models without transverse expansion. Only correlations in relative spatial rapidity are discussed here, but the prospects for extending these ideas to realistic calculations and for making realistic connections with experiment are discussed.",16,[],11

The calculated spectra give a very good description of most experimental equationCr and equationCr levels. The reduced equation-widths, rms intercluster separations and equation transition rates are determined for the ground state bands. The calculations reproduce the order of magnitude of the available experimental equation values without using effective charges and indicate that the first members of the ground state bands present a stronger equation-cluster character.

For central equation collisions the meson cloud can increase the multiplicity density by equation\%. We give predictions for the midrapidity charged multiplicity density in PbPb collisions at equation TeV for the future LHC run 2. We find that the meson cloud has a weak effect on the centrality dependence of the ellipticity equation in equation collisions.

Furthermore, we show that the zero-range limit of both finite-range interactions has the form of the N3LO Skyrme pseudo-potential, which thus constitutes a reliable approximation in the density range relevant for finite nuclei.

1602.01324,nucl-th,"We develop in this article a microscopic version of the successful phenomenological hydrodynamic Bohr-Davydov-Faessler-Greiner (BDFG) model for the collective rotation-vibration motion of a deformed nucleus. The model derivation is not limited to small oscillation amplitudes. The model generalizes the author's previous model to include interaction between collective oscillations in each pair of spatial directions, and to remove many of the previous-model approximations. To derive the model, the nuclear Schrodinger equation is canonically transformed to collective coordinates and then linearized using a constrained variational method. The associated transformation constraints are imposed on the wavefunction and not on the particle co-ordinates. This approach yields four self-consistent, time-reversal invariant, cranking-type Schrodinger equations for the rotation-vibration and intrinsic motions, and a self-consistency equation. To facilitate comparison with the BDFG model, simplify the solution of the equations, and gain physical insight, we restrict in this article the collective oscillations to only two space dimensions. For harmonic oscillator mean-field potentials, the equations are then solved in closed forms and applied to the ground-state rotational bands in some even-even light and rare-earth nuclei. The computed ground-state rotational band excitation energy, quadrupole moment and electric quadrupole transition probabilities are found to agree favourably with measured data and the results from mean-field, Sp(3,R), and SU(3) models.",16,[],11

This model is applicable to nuclei with large two-neutron halos compared to the core size, and a neutron-core scattering length larger than the interaction range. The halo wave function in momentum space is obtained by using as inputs the two-neutron separation energy and the energies of the singlet neutron-neutron and neutron-core virtual states. Within our model, we obtain the momentum probability densities for the Borromean exotic nuclei Lithium-11 (equationLi), Berylium-14 (equationBe) and Carbon-22 (equationC). A fair reproduction of the experimental data was obtained in the case of the core recoil momentum distribution of equationLi and equationBe, without free parameters.

There are several frequently used possibilities to define and calculate the surface energy coefficient asurf of effective interactions. The most direct access is provided by the model system of semi-infinite nuclear matter, but asurf can also be extracted from the systematics of binding energies of finite nuclei. Calculations can be carried out either self-consistently (HF), which incorporates quantal shell effects, or in one of the semi-classical Extended Thomas-Fermi (ETF) or Modified Thomas-Fermi (MTF) approximations.   The surface energy coefficient of 76 parameterizations of the Skyrme EDF have been calculated. Values obtained with the HF, ETF and MTF methods are not identical, but differ by fairly constant systematic offsets.   Despite having some drawbacks compared to the other methods studied here, the MTF approach provides sufficiently precise values for asurf such that it can be used as a very robust constraint on surface properties during a parameter fit at negligible additional cost. Through the construction of a series of eight parameterizations SLy5s1-SLy5s8 of the standard Skyrme EDF with systematically varied asurf value it is shown how to arrive at a fit with realistic deformation properties.

In this fashion, it is shown that placing a perfect reflector at the bottom of the graphene-covered metallic grating results in the realization of a graphene-based absorber. By utilizing the circuit theory, it is illustrated that perfect absorption in the structure is not exclusive to the TM polarization, but also the TE polarized plane waves can be completely absorbed by duly adjusting the Fermi level of graphene.

1610.02907,physics,"In view of new experimental data the instability against adiabatic nonaxisymmetric perturbations of a Taylor-Couette flow with an axial density stratification is considered in dependence of the Reynolds number Re of rotation and the Brunt-Vaisala number Rn of the stratification. The flows at and beyond the Rayleigh limit become unstable between a lower and an upper Reynolds number (for fixed Rn). The rotation can thus be too slow or too fast for the stratorotational instability. The upper Reynolds number above which the instability decays, has its maximum value for the potential flow (driven by cylinders rotating according to the Rayleigh limit) and decreases strongly for flatter rotation profiles finally leaving only isolated islands of instability in the (Rn/Re) map. The maximal possible rotation ratio equation only slightly exceeds the shear value of the quasi-uniform flow with equationconst.   Along and between the lines of neutral stability the wave numbers of the instability patterns for all rotation laws beyond the Rayleigh limit are mainly determined by the Froude number Fr which is defined by the ratio between Re and Rn. The cells are highly prolate for Fr>1 so that measurements for too high Reynolds numbers become difficult for axially bounded containers.

This result is associated with a specific geometry of the molecule, when the indicated vibrations can be nearly degenerated and can not be resolved by the SEHRS and SERS spectra analysis. This issue is in a full compliance with the results of the SEHRS and SERS Dipole-Quadrupole theory.",16,[],5
1602.04086,physics,"We introduce a rigorous and simple method for analyzing metasurfaces, modeled as zero-thickness electromagnetic sheets, in Finite Difference (FD) techniques. The method consists in describing the spatial discontinuity induced by the metasurface as a virtual structure, located between nodal rows of the Yee grid, using a finite difference version of Generalized Sheet Transition Conditions (GSTCs). In contrast to previously reported approaches, the proposed method can handle sheets exhibiting both electric and magnetic discontinuities, and represents therefore a fundamental contribution in computational electromagnetics. It is presented here in the framework of the FD Frequency Domain (FDFD) method but also applies to the FD Time Domain (FDTD) scheme. The theory is supported by five illustrative examples.",16,[],5
1611.00324,physics,"equation(equation), of the HequationequationO molecule is reported for temperatures between 0 and 6000 K. Determination of equation(equation) is principally based on the direct summation technique involving all accurate experimental energy levels known for HequationequationO (almost 20~000 rovibrational energies including an almost complete list up to a relative energy of 7500 \cm), augmented with a less accurate but complete list of first-principles computed rovibrational energy levels up to the first dissociation limit, about 41~000 \cm\ (the latter list includes close to one million bound rovibrational energy levels up to equation, where equation is the rotational quantum number). Partition functions are developed for \it ortho- and \it para-HequationequationO as well as for their equilibrium mixture. Unbound rovibrational states above the first dissociation limit are considered using an approximate model treatment. The effect of the excited electronic states on the thermochemical functions is neglected, as their contribution to the thermochemical functions is negligible even at the highest temperatures considered. Based on the high-accuracy equation(equation) and its first two moments, definitive results, in 1~K increments, are obtained for the following thermochemical functions: Gibbs energy, standardized enthalpy, entropy, and isobaric heat capacity. Reliable approximately two standard deviation uncertainties, as a function of temperature, are estimated for each quantity determined. These uncertainties emphasize that the present results are the most accurate ideal-gas thermochemical functions ever produced for HequationequationO. It is recommended that the new value determined for the standard molar enthalpy increment at 298.15~K, equation kJ~molequation, should replace the old CODATA datum, equation kJ~molequation.",16,[],5
1601.04524,physics,"The paper aims to consider the electromagnetic adjoint-field in the complex octonion space as the dark matter field, describing some properties of dark matter, especially the origin, particle category, existence region, and force and so forth. Since J. C. Maxwell applied the algebra of quaternions to depict the electromagnetic theory, some scholars adopt the complex quaternion and octonion to study the physics property of electromagnetic and gravitational fields. In the paper, by means of the octonion operator, it is found that the gravitational field accompanies with one adjoint-field, which property is partly similar to that of electromagnetic field. And the electromagnetic field accompanies with another adjoint-field, which feature is partly similar to that of gravitational field. As a result the electromagnetic adjoint-field is able to be chosen as one candidate of the dark matter field. According to the electromagnetic adjoint-field, it is able to predict a few properties of dark matter, for instance, the particle category, interaction intensity, interaction distance, and existence region and so forth. The study reveals that the dark matter particle and gravitational resource both will be influenced by the gravitational strength and force. The dark matter field is capable of making a contribution to physics quantities of gravitational field, including the angular momentum, torque, energy, and force and so on. Further there may be comparatively more chances to discover the dark matter in some regions with the ultrastrong field strength, surrounding the neutral star, white dwarf, galactic nucleus, black hole, and astrophysical jet and so on.",16,[],5

Numerical simulations performed in toroidal geometry with the \textscpixie3d code [L. Chac\'on, Phys. Plasmas \bf 15, 056103 (2008)] show that equation MPs significantly affect the spontaneous quasi-periodic sawtoothing activity of such plasmas. In particular, the mitigation of sawtooth oscillations is induced by equation and equation MPs. These numerical findings provide a confirmation of previous circular tokamak simulations, and are in agreement with tokamak experiments in the RFX-mod and DIII-D devices.

In this study, non-invasive methods for detection of cardiac aging using complexity measures are explored. Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity, Approximate Entropy (ApEn) and Effort-to-Compress (ETC) measures are used to differentiate between healthy young and old subjects using heartbeat interval data.

1601.02874,physics,"Large ring-laser gyroscopes are capable of measuring angular rotations with a precision well below fractions of equation, not far from equation equation, the accuracy required for General Relativity tests, this is what the GINGER (Gyroscope-IN-GEneral-Relativity) experiment is aiming for. These features do not guarantee the possibility of measuring the General Relativity Lense--Thirring effect, that manifests itself as a tiny (equation) perturbation of the Earth rotation rate. An underground location being in principle less affected by external local disturbances represents a good candidate for housing such a challenging experiment. GINGERino is a test apparatus to investigate the residual local disturbances in the most inner part of the underground international laboratory of the GranSasso (LNGS). It consists of a square ring laser with a equation m side. The instrument has been tailored to be the larger allowed by the particular location inside the laboratory. Its main objective is to measure the very low frequency rotational motions, in order to prove that LNGS is a suitable location for very low noise measurements and, possibly, General Relativity tests. Aside this main goal, GINGERino will provide unique data for geodesy and geophysics. Its installation has been completed during 2015. Since then, several long set of data have been collected, and the apparatus has been continuously running unattended for more than one week.

From the measured slip velocity we deduce the thermo-osmotic coefficient for both bare glass and Pluronic F-127 covered surfaces.

The three-dimensional distribution of linear absorption coefficients determined using a synchrotron radiation microtomograph with a simple projection geometry revealed that the X-ray absorption was homogeneously distributed, suggesting that every E. coli cell was labeled with the ferritin. The ferritin-expressing E. coli exhibited linear absorption coefficients comparable to those of phosphotungstic-acid stained cells. The submicrometer structure of the ferritin-expressing E. coli cells was visualized by Zernike phase contrast using an imaging microtomograph equipped with a Fresnel zone plate.

FPM employs ptychographic reconstruction to merge a series of low-resolution, wide field of view images into a high-resolution image. In the x-ray range this opens the possibility to overcome the limited numerical aperture of existing x-ray lenses. Furthermore, digital wave front correction (DWC) may be used to charaterize and correct lens imperfections.

1607.05306,physics,"An optical model for a solar power tower with an open volumetric air receiver (OVAR) was developed in this paper, and the optical performance and characteristics of the OVAR were studied based on the model. Firstly, the detailed distributions of the non-uniform solar flux (qsr) on the aperture and the solar source (Ssr) in the OVAR were studied. The solar flux was found to be relatively uniform across the aperture for a single OVAR. However the incident angle of the rays varies between 0o and 42o, which indicates that the parallel assumption of the rays is not appropriate at this condition. Furthermore, the Ssr in the absorber decreases from the inlet to the outlet, and the maximum source (Ssr,max) of 2.414X108 Wm-3 appears at the inlet. Moreover, the Ssr,max was found to appear at the region near the wall rather than the center of the receiver as usual for the combined effect of the non-parallel incident rays and the diffuse reflection on the wall. In addition, study on effects of the porous parameters indicates that the solid emissivity influences both the Ssr distribution and the receiver efficiency significantly. However, the pore diameter and the porosity influence Ssr distribution importantly, but have negligible effect on the efficiency. Finally, the optical efficiency of 86.70%, reflection loss of 13.20% and transmission loss of 0.10% were found to be achieved by the OVAR.",16,[],5
1605.04844,physics,"Collisionless shocks vary drastically from terrestrial to astrophysical regimes resulting in radically different characteristics. This poses two complexities. Firstly, separating the influences of these parameters on physical mechanisms such as energy dissipation. Secondly, correlating observations of shock waves over a wide range of each parameter, enough to span across different regimes. Investigating the latter has been restricted since the majority of studies on shocks at exotic regimes (such as supernova remnants) have been achieved either remotely or via simulations, but rarely by means of in-situ observations. Here we present the parameter space of MA bow shock crossings from 2004-2014 as observed by the Cassini spacecraft. We find that Saturn's bow shock exhibits characteristics akin to both terrestrial and astrophysical regimes (MA of order 100), which is principally controlled by the upstream magnetic field strength. Moreover, we determined the letterBn of each crossing to show that Saturn's (dayside) bow shock is predominantly quasi-perpendicular by virtue of the Parker spiral at 10 AU. Our results suggest a strong dependence on MA in controlling the onset of physical mechanisms in collisionless shocks, particularly non-time stationarity and variability. We anticipate our comprehensive assessment will yield deeper insight into high MA collisionless shocks and provide a broader scope for understanding the structures and mechanisms of collisionless shocks.",16,[],5

1601.02359,physics,"Forward imaging technique is the base of combined method on density reconstruction with the forward calculation and inverse problem solution.

We used the forward projection equation to gain the same deviation information about the object edge as the experimental image. Our forward projection equation is combined with Constrained Conjugate Gradient method to form a new method for density reconstruction, XTRACE-CCG. The new method worked on the simulated image of French Test Object and experimental image.

A equation-type electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is also observed for each group of velocity-selected atoms. The spectrum by only sweeping the probe beam can be decomposed into a combination of Doppler-broadened background and three VSOP dips for each group of velocity-selected atoms, companied by an EIT peak.

1607.02193,physics,"The linear stability threshold of the Rayleigh-Benard configuration is analyzed with compressible effects taken into account. It is assumed that the fluid obeys a Newtonian rheology and Fourier's law of thermal transport with constant, uniform (dynamic) viscosity and thermal conductivity in a uniform gravity field. Top and bottom boundaries are maintained at different constant temperatures and we consider here boundary conditions of zero tangential stress and impermeable walls. Under these conditions, and with the Boussinesq approximation, Rayleigh (1916) first obtained analytically the critical value 27pi4/4 for a dimensionless parameter, now known as the Rayleigh number, at the onset of convection. This manuscript describes the changes of the critical Rayleigh number due to the compressibility of the fluid, measured by the dimensionless dissipation parameter D and due to a finite temperature difference between the hot and cold boundaries, measured by a dimensionless temperature gradient a. Different equations of state are examined: ideal gas equation, Murnaghan's model and a generic equation of state, which can represent any possible equation of state. We also consider two variations of this stability analysis. In a so-called quasi-Boussinesq model, we consider that density perturbations are solely due to temperature perturbations. In a so-called quasi-anelastic liquid approximation, we consider that entropy perturbations are solely due to temperature perturbations. In addition to the numerical Chebyshev-based stability analysis, an analytical approximation is obtained when temperature fluctuations are written as a combination of only two modes. This analytical expression allows us to show that the superadiabatic critical Rayleigh number quadratic departure in a and D from 27pi4/4 involves the expansion of density up to the degree three in terms of pressure and temperature.",16,[],5

At the nanoscale, an efficient generation of these carriers is facilitated by illuminating plasmonic antennas. However, the ultrafast relaxation rate severally impedes their deployment in future hot-carrier based devices. In this paper, we report on the picosecond relaxation dynamics of hot carriers in plasmonic monocrystalline gold nanoantennas. The temporal dynamics of the hot carriers is experimentally investigated by interrogating the nonlinear photoluminescence response of the antenna with a spectrally-resolved two-pulse correlation configuration. We measure time-dependent nonlinearity orders varying from 1 to 8, which challenge the common interpretation of multi-photon gold luminescence. We demonstrate that the relaxation of the photo-excited carriers depends of their energies relative to the Fermi level. We find a 60 % variation in the relaxation rate for electron-hole pair energies ranging from c.a. 0.2 to 1.8 eV.

As such, there is a need to develop more robust, evidence-based models of how best to support faculty learning in professional development contexts, and to activity support workshop leaders in relating their design decisions to familiar ideas form other educational contexts. In response to these needs, we have developed an observation tool, the Real-Time Professional Development Observation Tool (R-PDOT), to document the form and focus of faculty's engagement during workshops. In this paper, we describe the motivation and methodological considerations behind the development of the R-PDOT, justify our decisions to highlight particular aspects of workshop sessions, and demonstrate how the R-PDOT can be used to analyze three sessions from the Physics and Astronomy New Faculty Workshop. We also justify the accessibility and potential utility of the R-PDOT output as a reflective tool using preliminary data from interviews with workshop leaders, and consider the roles the R-PDOT could play in supporting future research on faculty professional development.",16,[],5
1606.04389,physics,"The general scheme of power installations based on nuclear reactions of fission and synthesis activated by external sources is analyzed. The external activation makes possible to support nuclear reactions at temperatures and pressures lower than needed for chain reactions, so simplifies considerably practical realization of power installations. The possibility of operation on subcritical masses allows making installations compact and safe at emergency situations. Installations are suitable for transmutation of radioactive nuclides, what solves the problem of utilization of nuclear waste products. It is proposed and considered schemes of power installations based on nuclear reactions of fission and fusion, activated by external sources, different from ADS systems. Variants of activation of nuclear reactions of fission (U-235, 238, Pu-239) and fusion (Li-6,7, B-10,11) are considered.",16,[],5
1601.01485,physics,"A perturbative hybrid ideal-MHD/drift-kinetic approach to assess the stability of alpha-particle-driven Alfven eigenmodes in burning plasmas is used to show that certain foreseen ITER scenarios, namely the Ip = 15 MA baseline scenario with very low and broad core magnetic shear, are sensitive to small changes in the background magnetic equilibrium. Slight variations (of the order of 1%) of the safety-factor value on axis are seen to cause large changes in the growth rate, toroidal mode number, and radial location of the most unstable eigenmodes found. The observed sensitivity is shown to proceed from the very low magnetic shear values attained throughout the plasma core, raising issues about reliable predictions of alpha-particle transport in burning plasmas.",16,[],5

1602.02884,physics,"Thermonuclear fusion reactivity is a pivotal quantity in the studies pertaining to fusion energy production, fusion ignition and energy break-even analysis in both inertially and magnetically confined systems. Although nuclear fusion reactivity and thereafter the power density of a magnetic confinement fusion reactor and the fulfillment of the ignition criterion are quantitatively determined by assuming the ion speed distribution to be Maxwellian, a significant population of suprathermal ions,with energy greater than the quasi-Maxwellian background plasma temperature, is generated by the fusion reactions and auxiliary heating in the fusion devices. In the current work 3-parameter Dagum speed distribution has been introduced to include the effect of suprathermal ion population in the calculation of total fusion reactivity. The extent of enhancement in the fusion reactivity, at different back-ground temperatures of the fusion fuel plasma, due to the suprathermal ion population has also been discussed.",16,[],5
1604.01121,physics,"The electric or magnetic field of an ideal dipole is known to have a Dirac delta function at the origin. The usual textbook derivation of this delta function is rather ad hoc and cannot be used to calculate the delta-function structure for higher multipole moments. Moreover, a naive application of Gauss's law to the ideal dipole field appears to give an incorrect expression for the dipole's effective charge density. We derive a general result for the delta-function structure at the origin of an arbitrary ideal multipole field without using any advanced techniques from distribution theory. We find that the divergence of a singular vector field can contain a equation of a Dirac delta function even if the field itself does not contain a delta function. We also argue that a physical interpretation of the delta function in the dipole field previously given in the literature is incorrect.",16,[],5
1611.02449,physics,"Electrokinetic transport behavior in nanochannels is different to that in larger sized channels. Specifically, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in nanochannels have demonstrated two little understood phenomena which are not observed in microchannels, being: (i) the decrease of average electroosmotic mobility at high surface charge density, and (ii) the decrease of channel conductance at high salt concentrations, as the surface charge is increased. However, current electric double layer models do not capture these results. In this study we provide evidence that this inconsistency primarily arises from the neglect of the viscoelectric effect (being the increase of local viscosity near charged surfaces due to water molecule orientation) in conventional continuum models. It is shown that predictions of electroosmotic mobility in a slit nanochannel, derived from a viscoelectric-modified continuum model, are in quantitative agreement with previous MD simulation results. Furthermore, viscoelectric effects are found to dominate over ion steric and dielectric saturation effects in both electroosmotic and ion transport processes. Finally, we indicate that mechanisms of the previous MD-observed phenomena can be well-explained by the viscoelectric theory.",16,[],5
1605.00350,physics,"Simulations show Glyequation, a polypeptide lacking any side-chains, can collapse in water. We assess the hydration thermodynamics in this collapse by calculating the hydration free energy at each of the end points of the reaction coordinate, here the end-to-end distance (equation) in the chain. To examine the role of the various conformations for a given equation, we study the conditional distribution, equation, of the radius of gyration for a given value of equation. equation is found to vary more gently compared to the corresponding variation in the excess hydration free energy. Using this insight within a multistate generalization of the potential distribution theorem, we calculate a reasonable upper bound for the hydration free energy of the peptide for a given equation. On this basis we find that peptide hydration greatly favors the expanded state of the chain, despite primitive hydrophobic effects favoring chain collapse. The net free energy of collapse is seen to be a delicate balance between opposing intra-peptide and hydration effects, with intra-peptide contributions favoring collapse by a small margin. The favorable intra-peptide interactions are primarily electrostatic in origin, and found to arise primarily from interaction between C=O dipoles, hydrogen bonding interaction between C=O and N-H groups, and favorable interaction between N-H dipoles.",16,[],5

We show how to experimentally enable this optimization by retrieving all quantum features of the light-matter interaction from observable spectra.

1605.03398,physics,"In the context of high-accuracy computational thermochemistry, the valence CCSD correlation component of molecular atomization energies present the most severe basis set convergence problem, followed by the (T) component. In the present paper, we make a detailed comparison, for an expanded version of the W4-11 thermochemistry benchmark, between on the one hand orbital-based CCSD/AV5,6Zd and CCSD/ACV5,6Z extrapolation, and on the other hand CCSD-F12b calculations with cc-pVQZ-F12 and cc-pV5Z-F12 basis sets. This latter basis set, now available for H--He, B--Ne, and Al--Ar, is shown to be very close to the basis set limit. Apparent differences (which can reach 0.35 kcal/mol for systems like CCl4) between orbital-based and CCSD-F12b basis set limits disappear if basis sets with additional radial flexibility, such as ACV5,6Z, are used for the orbital calculation. Counterpoise calculations reveal that, while TAEs with V5Z-F12 basis sets are nearly free of BSSE, orbital calculations have significant BSSE even with AV(6d)Z basis sets, leading to non-negligible differences between raw and counterpoise-corrected extrapolated limits. This latter problem is greatly reduced by switching to ACV5,6Z core-valence basis sets, or simply adding an additional zeta to just the valence orbitals. Previous reports that all-electron approaches like HEAT lead to different CCSD(T) limits than valence limitCV correction approaches like FPD and W4 theory can be rationalized in terms of the greater radial flexibility of core-valence basis sets. W4-F12 is found to agree slightly better than W4 with ATcT (active thermochemical tables) data, at a substantial saving in CPU time and especially I/O overhead. A W4-F12 calculation on benzene is presented as a proof of concept.",16,[],5
1601.05135,physics,"Light beams with azimuthal phase dependence [equation] carry orbital angular momentum (OAM) which differs fundamentally from spin angular momentum (SAM) associated with polarization. Striking difference between the two momenta is manifested in the allowable values: where SAM is limited to equation per photon, the OAM has unbounded value of equation per photon (equation is integer), thus dramatically exceeding the value of SAM \citeRef1,Ref2, Ref3. OAM has thus been utilized in optical trapping \citeRef4, imaging\citeRef2, and material processing \citeRef5. Furthermore, the unbounded degrees-of-freedom in OAM states have been deployed in data communications \citeRef6. Here, we report an \textitexceptional behavior for a class of light beams---known as Frozen Waves (FWs)---whose intensity and azimuthal phase profiles can be controlled along the propagation direction, at will.

It is highlighted the electromagnetic orbital angular momentum of the system is nontrivial, and that the energy circulation is towards the same direction as that determined by incomplete cyclotron orbits near the cavity walls.

We propose and demonstrate a new, orders of magnitude more sensitive type of circular dichroism in neutral molecules: photoexitation circular dichroism. It does not rely on weak magnetic effects, but takes advantage of the coherent helical motion of bound electrons excited by ultrashort circularly polarized light. It results in an ultrafast chiral response and the efficient excitation of a macroscopic chiral density in an initially isotropic ensemble of randomly oriented chiral molecules. We probe this excitation without the aid of further chiral interactions using linearly polarized laser pulses. Our time-resolved study of vibronic chiral dynamics opens a way to the efficient initiation, control and monitoring of chiral chemical change in neutral molecules at the level of electrons.",16,[],5
1612.07111,physics,"Many fluctuation-driven phenomena in fluids can be analysed effectively using the generalised Lagrangian mean (GLM) theory of Andrews & McIntyre (1978). This theory relies on particle-following averaging to incorporate the constraints imposed by the material conservations. It relies implicitly on an Euclidean structure; as a result, it does not have a geometrically intrinsic interpretation and suffers from undesirable features, including the divergence of the Lagrangian-mean velocity for incompressible fluids. Motivated by this, we develop a geometric generalisation of GLM that we formulate intrinsically. The theory applies to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds; it also establishes a clear distinction between results that stem directly from geometric consistency and those that depend on particular choices. We show that the Lagrangian mean momentum -- the average of the pull-back of the momentum one-form -- obeys a simple equation which guarantees the conservation of Kelvin's circulation, irrespective of the mean-flow definition. We discuss four possible definitions of the mean flow: a direct extension of standard GLM, a definition based on optimal transportation, a definition based on a geodesic distance in the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, and the glm definition proposed by Soward & Roberts (2010). Assuming small-amplitude perturbations, we carry out order-by-order calculations to obtain explicit expressions for the mean flow and pseudomomentum at leading order. We also show how the wave-action conservation of GLM extends to the geometric setting. To make the paper self-contained, we introduce the tools of differential geometry and main ideas of geometric fluid dynamics on which we rely. We mostly focus on the Euler equations for incompressible inviscid fluids but sketch out extensions to the rotating-stratified Boussinesq, compressible Euler and magnetohydrodynamic equations.",16,[],5

1610.05774,physics,"In this work, a generic rigorous Bayesian formalism is introduced to predict the most likely path of any ion crossing a medium between two detection points. The path is predicted based on a combination of the particle scattering in the material and measurements of its initial and final position, direction and energy. The path estimate's precision is compared to the Monte Carlo simulated path. Every ion from hydrogen to carbon is simulated in two scenarios to estimate the accuracy achievable: one where the range is fixed and one where the initial velocity is fixed. In the scenario where the range is kept constant, the maximal root-mean-square error between the estimated path and the Monte Carlo path drops significantly between the proton path estimate (0.50 mm) and the helium path estimate (0.18 mm), but less so up to the carbon path estimate (0.09 mm). In the scenario where the initial velocity is kept constant, helium have systematically the minimal root-mean-square error throughout the path. As a result, helium is found to be the optimal particle for ion imaging.",16,[],5

The system is composed of four inter-communicating sub-systems referred here as a master SIB (safety-interlock board) and three partner SIBs. Each SIB monitors and processes 75 temperature sensors mainly located in the focal plane and also distributed inside the camera-head electronics. It monitors the signals from two pressure sensors, one humidity sensor as well as the connectivity to sixteen low-voltage and two high-voltage cables. The master SIB supervises the signals to and from external equipments like the cooling system, pressure gauge, power crates and status information from experimental environment.

Each subunit binds nucleotide in similar pockets, yet only equation subunits are catalytically active. Why? We re-examine their internal symmetry axes and observe interesting differences. Dividing each chain into an N-terminal head region, a C-terminal foot region, and a central torso, we observe (1) that while the foot and head regions in all chains obtain high and similar mobility, the torsos obtain different mobility profiles, with the equation subunits exhibiting a higher motility compared to the equation subunits, a trend supported by the crystallographic B-factors. The equation subunits have greater torso mobility by having fewer distributed, nonlocal packing interactions providing a spacious and soft connectivity, and offsetting the resultant softness with local stiffness elements, including an additional equation sheet. (2) A loop near the nucleotide binding-domain of the equation subunits, absent in the equation subunits, swings to create a large variation in the occlusion of the nucleotide binding region.

1603.06879,q-bio,"A long-standing hypothesis in neuroscience is that the central nervous system accomplishes complex motor behaviors through the combination of a small number of motor primitives. Many studies in the last couples of decades have identified motor primitives at the kinematic, kinetic, and electromyographic level, thus supporting modularity at different levels of organization in the motor system. However, these studies relied on heterogeneous definitions of motor primitives and on different algorithms for their identification. Standard unsupervised learning algorithms such as principal component analysis, independent component analysis, and non-negative matrix factorization, or more advanced techniques involving the estimation of temporal delays of the relevant mixture components have been applied. This plurality of algorithms has made difficult to compare and interpret results obtained across different studies. Moreover, how the different definitions of motor primitives relate to each other has never been examined systematically. Here we propose a comprehensive framework for the definition of different types of motor primitives and a single algorithm for their identification. By embedding smoothness priors and specific constraints in the underlying generative model, the algorithm can identify many different types of motor primitives. We assessed the identification performance of the algorithm both on simulated data sets, for which the properties of the primitives and of the corresponding combination parameters were known, and on experimental electromyographic and kinematic data sets, collected from human subjects accomplishing goal-oriented and rhythmic motor tasks. The identification accuracy of the new algorithm was typically equal or better than the accuracy of other unsupervised learning algorithms used previously for the identification of the same types of primitives.",16,[],10

We show by that such explicit models often yield significantly different equilibrium distributions and transition times as compared to DDEs with deterministic delay values. Additionally, different explicit models with qualitatively different dynamics can give rise to the same DDEs revealing important ambiguities.

1609.09051,q-bio,"Reconstructing who infected whom is a central challenge in analysing epidemiological data. Recently, advances in sequencing technology have led to increasing interest in Bayesian approaches to inferring who infected whom using genetic data from pathogens. The logic behind such approaches is that isolates that are nearly genetically identical are more likely to have been recently transmitted than those that are very different. A number of methods have been developed to perform this inference. However, testing their convergence, examining posterior sets of transmission trees and comparing methods' performance are challenged by the fact that the object of inference - the transmission tree - is a complicated discrete structure. We introduce a metric on transmission trees to quantify distances between them. The metric can accommodate trees with unsampled individuals, and highlights differences in the source case and in the number of infections per infector. We illustrate its performance on simple simulated scenarios and on posterior transmission trees from a TB outbreak. We find that the metric reveals where the posterior is sensitive to the priors, and where collections of trees are composed of distinct clusters. We use the metric to define median trees summarising these clusters. Quantitative tools to compare transmission trees to each other will be required for assessing MCMC convergence, exploring posterior trees and benchmarking diverse methods as this field continues to mature.",16,[],10

How does the brain's network of anatomical connections help facilitate such transitions? Which features of this network contribute to making one transition easy and another transition difficult? Here, we address these questions using network control theory. We calculate the optimal input signals to drive the brain to and from states dominated by different cognitive systems. The input signals allow us to assess the contributions made by different brain regions. We show that such contributions, which we measure as energy, are correlated with regions' weighted degrees. We also show that the network communicability, a measure of direct and indirect connectedness between brain regions, predicts the extent to which brain regions compensate when input to another region is suppressed. Finally, we identify optimal states in which the brain should start (and finish) in order to minimize transition energy. We show that the optimal target states display high activity in hub regions, implicating the brain's rich club.

How can these molecules evolve when their function depends on maintenance of interactions with cognate partners and simultaneous avoidance of deleterious ""crosstalk"" with non-cognate molecules? Although physical models of molecular interactions provide a framework in which co-evolution of network components can be analyzed, most theoretical studies have focused on the evolution of individual alleles, neglecting the network. In contrast, we study the elementary step in the evolution of gene regulatory networks: duplication of a transcription factor followed by selection for TFs to specialize their inputs as well as the regulation of their downstream genes. We show how to coarse grain the complete, biophysically realistic genotype-phenotype map for this process into macroscopic functional outcomes and quantify the probability of attaining each.

1612.01229,q-bio,"Essential Tremor is the most common neurological movement disorder. This progressive disease causes uncontrollable rhythmic motions -most often affecting the patient's dominant upper extremity- that occur during volitional movement and make it difficult for the patient to perform everyday tasks. Medication may also become ineffective as the disorder progresses. For many patients, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamus is an effective means of treating this condition when medication fails. In current use, however, clinicians set the patient's stimulator to apply stimulation at all times- whether it is needed or not. This practice leads to excess power use, and more rapid depletion of batteries that require surgical replacement. In the work described here, for the first time, neural sensing of movement (using chronically-implanted cortical electrodes) is used to enable or disable stimulation for tremor. Therapeutic stimulation is delivered only when the patient is actively using their effected limb, thereby reducing the total stimulation applied, and potentially extending the lifetime of surgically-implanted batteries.

1611.10318,q-bio,"There is general agreement that the former (breeding) macrohabitat of the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (synonym: Stegomyia albopicta) has been described as phytotelmata in the forested areas of Southeast Asia, however, this has changed in the last four decades as it has adapted to more urban areas and antrotelmata. Capable of producing eggs with a certain dry resistance as well as cold hardiness, populations of Ae. albopictus became distributed around the globe. The invasion of the Ae. albopictus across all over the world is thought to be the most rapid spread of any insect species in the last four decades in tropical, subtropical and temperate climate zones. In addition, Ae. albopictus is a potential vector for at least 27 viruses as well as for several parasites and plays a major role in the global transmission of dengue virus and chikungunya virus; and its contribution to the rapid spread of zika virus is currently under investigation. Therefore, this species is considered a serious threat to public health worldwide. This work broaches the issue of three investigations about the potential to adapt and establish stabile populations of the invasive Asian tiger mosquito Ae. albopictus. As a result of these investigations, a high potential for this species to become a threat to public health in many more countries, especially in temperate climatic zones, can be seen. Due to the fact on the one hand that Ae. albopictus can gain fitness advantages due to misapplied vector control measures and on the other hand of the high epigenetically adaptation potential, it is in summary recommended to focus further research on the development of vaccinations for viruses and other pathogens.

1605.05367,q-bio,"HIV-1 infection currently cannot be cured because the virus persists as integrated proviral DNA in long-lived cells despite years of suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). To characterize establishment, turnover, and evolution of viral DNA reservoirs we deep-sequenced the p17gag region of the HIV-1 genome from samples obtained after 3-18 years of suppressive ART from 10 patients. For each of these patients, whole genome deep-sequencing data of HIV-1 RNA populations before onset of ART were available from 6-12 longitudinal plasma samples spanning 5-8 years of untreated infection. This enabled a detailed analysis of the dynamics and origin of proviral DNA during ART. A median of 14% (range 0-42%) of the p17gag DNA sequences were overtly defective due to G-to-A hypermutation. The remaining sequences were remarkably similar to previously observed RNA sequences and showed no evidence of evolution over many years of suppressive ART. Most sequences from the DNA reservoirs were very similar to viruses actively replicating in plasma (RNA sequences) shortly before start of ART. The results do not support persistent HIV-1 replication as a mechanism to maintain the HIV-1 reservoir during suppressive therapy.

1609.00620,q-bio,"Bone remodeling is a complex process involving cell-cell interactions, biochemical signaling and mechanical stimuli. Early models of the biological aspects of remodeling were non-spatial and focused on the local dynamics at a fixed location in the bone. Several spatial extensions of these models have been proposed, but they generally suffer from two limitations: first, they are not amenable to analysis and are computationally expensive, and second, they neglect the role played by bone-embedded osteocytes. To address these issues, we developed a novel model of spatial remodeling based on the principles of evolutionary game theory. The analytically tractable framework describes the spatial interactions between zones of bone resorption, bone formation and quiescent bone, and explicitly accounts for regulation of remodeling by bone-embedded, mechanotransducing osteocytes. Using tools from the theory of interacting particle systems we systematically classified the different dynamic regimes of the spatial model and identified regions of parameter space that allow for coexistence of resorption, formation and quiescence, as observed in physiological remodeling. In coexistence scenarios, three-dimensional simulations revealed the emergence of sponge-like bone clusters. Comparison between spatial and non-spatial dynamics revealed substantial differences and suggested a stabilizing role of space. Our findings emphasize the importance of accounting for spatial structure and bone-embedded osteocytes when modeling the process of bone remodeling. Thanks to the lattice-based framework, the proposed model can easily be coupled to a mechanical model of bone loading.",16,[],10
1602.04258,q-bio,"Phylogenetic trees are pervasively used to depict evolutionary relationships. Increasingly, researchers need to visualize large trees and compare multiple large trees inferred for the same set of taxa (reflecting uncertainty in the tree inference or genuine discordance among the loci analysed). Existing tree visualization tools are however not well suited to these tasks. In particular, side-by-side comparison of trees can prove challenging beyond a few dozen taxa. Here, we introduce Phylo.io, a web application to visualize and compare phylogenetic trees side-by-side. Its distinctive features are: highlighting of similarities and differences between two trees, automatic identification of the best matching rooting and leaf order, scalability to very large trees, high usability, multiplatform support via standard HTML5 implementation, and possibility to store and share visualisations. The tool can be freely accessed at http://phylo.io. The code for the associated JavaScript library is available at https://github.com/DessimozLab/phylo-io under an MIT open source license.",16,[],10
1602.03493,q-bio,"Humans often make decisions which maximize an internal utility function. For example, humans often maximize their expected reward when gambling and this is considered as a ""rational"" decision. However, humans tend to change their betting strategies depending on how they ""feel"". If someone has experienced a losing streak, they may ""feel"" that they are more likely to win on the next hand even though the odds of the game have not changed. That is, their decisions are driven by their emotional state. In this paper, we investigate how the human brain responds to wins and losses during gambling. Using a combination of local field potential recordings in human subjects performing a financial decision-making task, spectral analyses, and non-parametric cluster statistics, we investigated whether neural responses in different cognitive and limbic brain areas differ between wins and losses after decisions are made. In eleven subjects, the neural activity modulated significantly between win and loss trials in one brain region: the anterior insula (equation). In particular, gamma activity (30-70 Hz) increased in the anterior insula when subjects just realized that they won. Modulation of metabolic activity in the anterior insula has been observed previously in functional magnetic resonance imaging studies during decision making and when emotions are elicited. However, our study is able to characterize temporal dynamics of electrical activity in this brain region at the millisecond resolution while decisions are made and after outcomes are revealed.",16,[],10
1609.06547,q-bio,"Background: Combining computational toxicology with ExpoCast exposure estimates and ToxCast assay data gives us access to predictions of human health risks stemming from exposures to chemical mixtures.   Objectives: To explore, through mathematical modeling and simulations, the size of potential effects of random mixtures of aromatase inhibitors on the dynamics of women's menstrual cycles.   Methods: We simulated random exposures to millions of potential mixtures of 86 aromatase inhibitors. A pharmacokinetic model of intake and disposition of the chemicals predicted their internal concentration as a function of time (up to two years). A ToxCast aromatase assay provided concentration-inhibition relationships for each chemical. The resulting total aromatase inhibition was input to a mathematical model of the hormonal hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian control of ovulation in women.   Results: Above 10% inhibition of estradiol synthesis by aromatase inhibitors, noticeable (eventually reversible) effects on ovulation were predicted. Exposures to individual chemicals never led to such effects. In our best estimate, about 10% of the combined exposures simulated had mild to catastrophic impacts on ovulation. A lower bound on that figure, obtained using an optimistic exposure scenario, was 0.3%.   Conclusions: These results demonstrate the possibility to predict large-scale mixture effects for endocrine disrupters with a predictive toxicology approach, suitable for high-throughput ranking and risk assessment. The size of the effects predicted is consistent with an increased risk of infertility in women from everyday exposures to our chemical environment.",16,[],10
1604.00002,q-bio,"Several experiments evidence that specialized brain regions functionally interact and reveal that the brain processes and integrates information in a specific and structured manner. Networks can be used to model brain functional activities constituting a way to characterize and quantify this structured form of organization. Reports state that different physiological states or even diseases that affect the central nervous system may be associated to alterations on those networks, that might reflect in graphs of different architectures. However, the relation of their structure to different states or conditions of the organism is not well comprehended. Thus, experiments that involve the estimation of functional neural networks of subjects exposed to different controlled conditions are of great relevance. Within this context, this research has sought to model large scale functional brain networks during an anesthetic induction process. The experiment was based on intra-cranial recordings of neural activities of an old world macaque of the species Macaca fuscata. Neural activity was recorded during a Ketamine-Medetomidine anesthetic induction process. Networks were serially estimated in time intervals of five seconds. Changes were observed in various networks properties within about one and a half minutes after the administration of the anesthetics. These changes reveal the occurrence of a transition on the networks architecture. During general anesthesia a reduction in the functional connectivity and network integration capabilities were verified in both local and global levels. It was also observed that the brain shifted to a highly specific and dynamic state. The results bring empirical evidence and report the relation of the induced state of anesthesia to properties of functional networks, thus, they contribute for the elucidation of some new aspects of neural correlates of consciousness.",16,[],10
1605.09070,q-bio,"Variant detection from high-throughput sequencing data is an essential step in identification of alleles involved in complex diseases and cancer. To deal with these massive data, elaborated sequence analysis pipelines are employed. A core component of such pipelines is a read mapping module whose accuracy strongly affects the quality of resulting variant calls.   We propose a dynamic read mapping approach that significantly improves read alignment accuracy. The general idea of dynamic mapping is to continuously update the reference sequence on the basis of previously computed read alignments. Even though this concept already appeared in the literature, we believe that our work provides the first comprehensive analysis of this approach.   To evaluate the benefit of dynamic mapping, we developed a software pipeline (http://github.com/karel-brinda/dymas) that mimics different dynamic mapping scenarios. The pipeline was applied to compare dynamic mapping with the conventional static mapping and, on the other hand, with the so-called iterative referencing - a computationally expensive procedure computing an optimal modification of the reference that maximizes the overall quality of all alignments. We conclude that in all alternatives, dynamic mapping results in a much better accuracy than static mapping, approaching the accuracy of iterative referencing.   To correct the reference sequence in the course of dynamic mapping, we developed an online consensus caller named OCOCO (http://github.com/karel-brinda/ococo). OCOCO is the first consensus caller capable to process input reads in the online fashion.   Finally, we provide conclusions about the feasibility of dynamic mapping and discuss main obstacles that have to be overcome to implement it. We also review a wide range of possible applications of dynamic mapping with a special emphasis on variant detection.",16,[],10
1610.04255,q-bio,"Recent advances in sound engineering have led to the development of so-called streamlined music designed to reduce exogenous attention and improve endogenous attention. Although anecdotal reports suggest that streamlined music does indeed improve focus on daily work tasks and may improve mood, the specific influences of streamlined music on cognition and mood have yet to be examined. In this paper, we report the results of a series of online experiments that examined the impact of one form of streamlined music on cognition and mood. The tested form of streamlined music, which was tested primarily by listeners who felt they benefited from this type of music, significantly outperformed plain music on measures of perceived focus, task persistence, precognition, and creative thinking, with borderline effects on mood. In contrast, this same form of streamlined music did not significantly influence measures assessing visual attention, verbal memory, logical thinking, self-efficacy, perceived stress, or self-transcendence. We also found that improvements in perceived focus over a 2-month period were correlated with improvements in emotional state, including mood. Overall the results suggest that at least for individuals who enjoy using streamlined music as a focus tool, streamlined music can have a beneficial impact on cognition without any obvious costs, while at the same time it may potentially boost mood.",16,[],10
1603.08386,q-bio,"Motivation: DNA methylation is an intensely studied epigenetic mark, yet its functional role is incompletely understood. Attempts to quantitatively associate average DNA methylation to gene expression yield poor correlations outside of the well-understood methylation-switch at CpG islands.   Results: Here we use probabilistic machine learning to extract higher order features associated with the methylation profile across a defined region. These features quantitate precisely notions of shape of a methylation profile, capturing spatial correlations in DNA methylation across genomic regions. Using these higher order features across promoter-proximal regions, we are able to construct a powerful machine learning predictor of gene expression, significantly improving upon the predictive power of average DNA methylation levels. Furthermore, we can use higher order features to cluster promoter-proximal regions, showing that five major patterns of methylation occur at promoters across different cell lines, and we provide evidence that methylation beyond CpG islands may be related to regulation of gene expression. Our results support previous reports of a functional role of spatial correlations in methylation patterns, and provide a mean to quantitate such features for downstream analyses.

1604.03834,q-bio,"The Zika virus is the primary suspect in the large increase in microcephaly cases in 2015-6 in Brazil, however its role is unconfirmed despite individual cases of viral infections found in neural tissue. Here we consider the alternative that the insecticide pyriproxyfen, used in Brazilian drinking water for mosquito control, may actually be the cause. Pyriproxifen is an analog of juvenile hormone, which corresponds in mammals to regulatory molecules including retinoic acid, a vitamin A metabolite, with which it has cross-reactivity and whose application during development causes microcephaly. Methoprene, another juvenile hormone analog approved as an insecticide has metabolites that bind to the retinoid X receptor, and causes developmental disorders in mammals. Isotretinoin is another example of a retinoid causing microcephaly in human babies via activation of the retinoid X receptor. Moreover, tests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer, Sumitomo, widely quoted as giving no evidence for developmental toxicity, actually found some evidence for such an effect, including low brain mass and arhinencephaly--incomplete formation of the anterior cerebral hemispheres--in rat pups. Finally, the pyriproxyfen use in Brazil is unprecedented--it has never before been applied to a water supply on such a scale. Claims that it is not being used in Recife, the epicenter of microcephaly cases, do not distinguish the metropolitan area of Recife, where it is widely used, and the municipality, where it is not. Given this combination of information we strongly recommend that the use of pyriproxyfen in Brazil be suspended pending further investigation.",16,[],10
1606.07350,q-bio,"Phylogenetic networks model reticulate evolutionary histories. The last two decades have seen an increased interest in establishing mathematical results and developing computational methods for inferring and analyzing these networks. A salient concept underlying a great majority of these developments has been the notion that a network displays a set of trees and those trees can be used to infer, analyze, and study the network.   In this paper, we show that in the presence of coalescence effects, the set of displayed trees is not sufficient to capture the network. We formally define the set of parental trees of a network and make three contributions based on this definition. First, we extend the notion of anomaly zone to phylogenetic networks and report on anomaly results for different networks. Second, we demonstrate how coalescence events could negatively affect the ability to infer a species tree that could be augmented into the correct network. Third, we demonstrate how a phylogenetic network can be viewed as a mixture model that lends itself to a novel inference approach via gene tree clustering.   Our results demonstrate the limitations of focusing on the set of trees displayed by a network when analyzing and inferring the network. Our findings can form the basis for achieving higher accuracy when inferring phylogenetic networks and open up new venues for research in this area, including new problem formulations based on the notion of a network's parental trees.",16,[],10

1606.06559,q-bio,"The speciation model proposed by Derrida and Higgs demonstrated that a sexually reproducing population can split into different species in the absence of natural selection or any type of geographic isolation, provided that mating is assortative and the number of genes involved in the process is infinite. Here we revisit this model and simulate it for finite genomes, focusing on the question of how many genes it actually takes to trigger neutral sympatric speciation. We find that, for typical parameters used in the original model, it takes of the order of equation genes. We compare the results with a similar spatially explicit model where about 100 genes suffice for speciation. We show that when the number of genes is small the species that emerge are strongly segregated in space. For larger number of genes, on the other hand, the spatial structure of the population is less important and the species distribution overlap considerably.",16,[],10
1604.00167,q-bio,"Bacterial growth depends crucially on metabolic fluxes, which are limited by the cell's capacity to maintain metabolic enzymes. The necessary enzyme amount per unit flux is a major determinant of metabolic strategies both in evolution and bioengineering. It depends on enzyme parameters (such as kcat and KM constants), but also on metabolite concentrations. Moreover, similar amounts of different enzymes might incur different costs for the cell, depending on enzyme-specific properties such as protein size and half-life. Here, we developed enzyme cost minimization (ECM), a scalable method for computing enzyme amounts that support a given metabolic flux at a minimal protein cost. The complex interplay of enzyme and metabolite concentrations, e.g. through thermodynamic driving forces and enzyme saturation, would make it hard to solve this optimization problem directly. By treating enzyme cost as a function of metabolite levels, we formulated ECM as a numerically tractable, convex optimization problem. Its tiered approach allows for building models at different levels of detail, depending on the amount of available data. Validating our method with measured metabolite and protein levels in E. coli central metabolism, we found typical prediction fold errors of 3.8 and 2.7, respectively, for the two kinds of data. ECM can be used to predict enzyme levels and protein cost in natural and engineered pathways, establishes a direct connection between protein cost and thermodynamics, and provides a physically plausible and computationally tractable way to include enzyme kinetics into constraint-based metabolic models, where kinetics have usually been ignored or oversimplified.",16,[],10
1603.04721,q-bio,"Subjective tinnitus (ST) is generally assumed to be a consequence of hearing loss (HL). In animal studies acoustic trauma can lead to behavioral signs of ST, in human studies ST patients without increased hearing thresholds were found to suffer from so called hidden HL. Additionally, ST is correlated with pathologically increased spontaneous firing rates and neuronal hyperactivity (NH) along the auditory pathway. Homeostatic plasticity (HP) has been proposed as a compensation mechanism leading to the development of NH, arguing that after HL initially decreased mean firing rates of neurons are subsequently restored by increased spontaneous rates. However all HP models fundamentally lack explanatory power since the function of keeping mean firing rate constant remains elusive as does the benefit this might have in terms of information processing. Furthermore the neural circuitry being able to perform the comparison of preferred with actual mean firing rate remains unclear. Here we propose an entirely new interpretation of ST related development of NH in terms of information theory. We suggest that stochastic resonance (SR) plays a key role in short- and long-term plasticity within the auditory system and is the ultimate cause of NH and ST. SR has been found ubiquitous in neuroscience and refers to the phenomenon that sub-threshold, unperceivable signals can be transmitted by adding noise to sensor input. We argue that after HL, SR serves to lift signals above the increased hearing threshold, hence subsequently decreasing thresholds again. The increased amount of internal noise is the correlate of the NH, which finally leads to the development of ST, due to neuronal plasticity along the auditory pathway. We demonstrate the plausibility of our hypothesis by using a computational model and provide exemplarily findings of human and animal studies that are consistent with our model.",16,[],10
1603.05497,q-bio,"During the lifecycle of a virus, viral proteins and other components self-assemble to form a symmetric protein shell called a capsid. This assembly process is subject to multiple competing constraints, including the need to form a thermostable shell while avoiding kinetic traps. It has been proposed that viral assembly satisfies these constraints through allosteric regulation, including the interconversion of capsid proteins among conformations with different propensities for assembly. In this article we use computational and theoretical modeling to explore how such allostery affects the assembly of icosahedral shells. We simulate assembly under a wide range of protein concentrations, protein binding affinities, and two different mechanisms of allosteric control. We find that, above a threshold strength of allosteric control, assembly becomes robust over a broad range of subunit binding affinities and concentrations, allowing the formation of highly thermostable capsids. Our results suggest that allostery can significantly shift the range of protein binding affinities that lead to successful assembly, and thus should be accounted for in models that are used to estimate interaction parameters from experimental data.",16,[],10
1605.03373,q-bio,"Retinal circuitry transforms spatiotemporal patterns of light into spiking activity of ganglion cells, which provide the sole visual input to the brain. Recent advances have led to a detailed characterization of retinal activity and stimulus encoding by large neural populations. The inverse problem of decoding, where the stimulus is reconstructed from spikes, has received less attention, in particular for complex input movies that should be reconstructed ""pixel-by-pixel"". We recorded around a hundred neurons from a dense patch in a rat retina and decoded movies of multiple small discs executing mutually-avoiding random motions. We constructed nonlinear (kernelized) decoders that improved significantly over linear decoding results, mostly due to their ability to reliably separate between neural responses driven by locally fluctuating light signals, and responses at locally constant light driven by spontaneous or network activity. This improvement crucially depended on the precise, non-Poisson temporal structure of individual spike trains, which originated in the spike-history dependence of neural responses. Our results suggest a general paradigm in which downstream neural circuitry could discriminate between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity on the basis of higher-order statistical structure intrinsic to the incoming spike trains.",16,[],10

1608.04541,q-bio,"Using an analytically solvable stochastic model, we study the properties of a simple genetic circuit consisting of multiple copies of an self-regulating gene. We analyse how the variation in gene copy number and the mutations changing the auto-regulation strength affect the steady-state distribution of protein concentration.   We predict that one-reporter assay, an experimental method where the extrinsic noise level is inferred from the comparison of expression variance of a single and duplicated reporter gene, may give an incorrect estimation of the extrinsic noise contribution when applied to self-regulating genes.   We also show that an imperfect duplication of an auto-activated gene, changing the regulation strength of one of the copies, may lead to a hybrid, binarygraded response of these genes to external signal.   The analysis of relative changes in mean gene expression before and after duplication suggests that evolutionary accumulation of gene duplications may non-trivially depend on the inherent noisiness of a given gene, quantified by maximal mean frequency of bursts.   Moreover, we find that the dependence of gene expression noise on gene copy number and auto-regulation strength may qualitatively differ, e.g. in monotonicity, depending on whether the noise is measured by Fano factor or coefficient of variation. Thus, experimentally-based hypotheses linking gene expression noise and evolutionary optimisation may be ambiguous as they are dependent on the particular function chosen to quantify noise.",16,[],10

Overcoming these limitations requires further development on clustering algorithms for cryo-EM data analysis. We propose a novel unsupervised data clustering method building upon the traditional K-means algorithm. By introducing an adaptive constraint term in the objective function, our algorithm not only avoids a large variation in class sizes but also produces more accurate data clustering.

Much work has investigated the factors that affect the amount of information encoded in these population responses, leading to insights about the role of covariability among neurons, tuning curve shape, etc. However, the informativeness of neural responses is not the only relevant feature of population codes; of potentially equal importance is how robustly that information propagates to downstream structures. For instance, to quantify the retina's performance, one must consider not only the informativeness of the optic nerve responses, but also the amount of information that survives the spike-generating nonlinearity and noise corruption in the next stage of processing, the lateral geniculate nucleus. Our study identifies the set of covariance structures for the upstream cells that optimize the ability of information to propagate through noisy, nonlinear circuits. Within this optimal family are covariances with ""differential correlations"", which are known to reduce the information encoded in neural population activities. Thus, covariance structures that maximize information in neural population codes, and those that maximize the ability of this information to propagate, can be very different.",16,[],10

It relies on many processes, but one of the most important is a \it homologous recombination, in which the repair of breaks in double-stranded DNA molecules is taking place with a help of several specific proteins. In bacteria this task is accomplished by RecA proteins that are active as nucleoprotein filaments formed on single-stranded segments of DNA. A critical step in the homologous recombination is a search for a corresponding homologous region on DNA, which is called a \it homology search. Recent single-molecule experiments clarified some aspects of this process, but its molecular mechanisms remain not well understood. We developed a quantitative theoretical approach to analyze the homology search. It is based on a discrete-state stochastic model that takes into account the most relevant physical-chemical processes in the system. Using a method of first-passage processes, a full dynamic description of the homology search is presented. It is found that the search dynamics depends on the degree of extension of DNA molecules and on the size of RecA nucleoprotein filaments, in agreement with experimental single-molecule measurements of DNA pairing by RecA proteins.

Yet how individual differences in these anatomical pathways may impact individual differences in learning remains far from understood. Here, we test the hypothesis that individual differences in the organization of structural networks supporting task performance predict individual differences in the rate at which humans learn a visuo-motor skill. Over the course of 6 weeks, twenty-two healthy adult subjects practiced a discrete sequence production task, where they learned a sequence of finger movements based on discrete visual cues. We collected structural imaging data during four MRI scanning sessions spaced approximately two weeks apart, and using deterministic tractography, structural networks were generated for each participant to identify streamlines that connect cortical and sub-cortical brain regions. We observed that increased white matter connectivity linking early visual (but not motor) regions was associated with a faster learning rate. Moreover, we observed that the strength of multi-edge paths between motor and visual modules was also correlated with learning rate, supporting the role of polysynaptic connections in successful skill acquisition.

1610.00638,q-bio,"Most of the existing research in assembly pathway prediction/analysis of virus cap- sids makes the simplifying assumption that the configuration of the intermediate states can be extracted directly from the final configuration of the entire capsid. This assump- tion does not take into account the conformational changes of the constituent proteins as well as minor changes to the binding interfaces that continues throughout the assembly process until stabilization. This paper presents a statistical-ensemble based approach which provides sufficient samples of the configurational space for each monomer and the relative local orientation between monomers, to capture the uncertainties in their binding and conformations. Furthermore, instead of using larger capsomers (trimers, pentamers) as building blocks, we allow all possible sub-assemblies to bind in all pos- sible combinations. We represent this assembly graph in two different ways. First, we use the Wilcoxon signed rank measure to compare the distributions of binding free energy computed on the sampled conformations to predict likely pathways. Second, we represent chemical equilibrium aspects of the transitions as a Bayesian Factor graph where both associations and dissociations are modeled based on concentrations and the binding free energies. Results from both of these experiments showed significant departure from those one would obtain if only the static configurations of the proteins were considered. Hence, we establish the importance of an uncertainty-aware protocol for pathway analysis, and provide a statistical framework as an important first step towards assembly pathway prediction with high statistical confidence.",16,[],10
1611.07962,q-bio,"A major challenge in neuroimaging is understanding the mapping of neurophysiological dynamics onto cognitive functions. Traditionally, these maps have been constructed by examining changes in the activity magnitude of regions related to task performance. Recently, network neuroscience has produced methods to map connectivity patterns among many regions to certain cognitive functions by drawing on tools from network science and graph theory. However, these two different views are rarely addressed simultaneously, largely because few tools exist that account for patterns between nodes while simultaneously considering activation of nodes. We address this gap by solving the problem of community detection on weighted networks with continuous (non-integer) annotations by deriving a generative probabilistic model. This model generates communities whose members connect densely to nodes within their own community, and whose members share similar annotation values. We demonstrate the utility of the model in the context of neuroimaging data gathered during a motor learning paradigm, where edges are task-based functional connectivity and annotations to each node are beta weights from a general linear model that encoded a linear decrease in blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal with practice. Interestingly, we observe that individuals who learn at a faster rate exhibit the greatest dissimilarity between functional connectivity and activation magnitudes, suggesting that activation and functional connectivity are distinct dimensions of neurophysiology that track behavioral change. More generally, the tool that we develop offers an explicit, mathematically principled link between functional activation and functional connectivity, and can readily be applied to a other similar problems in which one set of imaging data offers network data, and a second offers a regional attribute.",16,[],10
1604.04796,q-bio,"We consider a classical space-clamped Hodgkin-Huxley model neuron stimulated by synaptic excitation and inhibition with conductances represented by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. Using numerical solutions of the stochastic model system obtained by an Euler method, it is found that with excitation only there is a critical value of the steady state excitatory conductance for repetitive spiking without noise and for values of the conductance near the critical value small noise has a powerfully inhibitory effect. For a given level of inhibition there is also a critical value of the steady state excitatory conductance for repetitive firing and it is demonstrated that noise either in the excitatory or inhibitory processes or both can powerfully inhibit spiking. Furthermore, near the critical value, inverse stochastic resonance was observed when noise was present only in the inhibitory input process.   The system of 27 coupled deterministic differential equations for the approximate first and second order moments of the 6-dimensional model is derived. The moment differential equations are solved using Runge-Kutta methods and the solutions are compared with the results obtained by simulation for various sets of parameters including some with conductances obtained by experiment on pyramidal cells of rat prefrontal cortex. The mean and variance obtained from simulation are in good agreement when there is spiking induced by strong stimulation and relatively small noise or when the voltage is fluctuating at subthreshold levels. In the occasional spike mode sometimes exhibited by spinal motoneurons and cortical pyramidal cells the assunptions underlying the moment equation approach are not satisfied.",16,[],10
1606.07398,q-bio,"Information processing in the brain crucially depends on encoding properties of single neurons, with particular relevance of the spike-generation mechanism. The latter hinges upon the bifurcation type at the transition point between resting state and limit cycle spiking. Prominent qualitative changes in encoding have previously been attributed to a specific switch of such a bifurcation at the Bogdanov-Takens (BT) point. This study unveils another, highly relevant and so far underestimated transition point: the saddle-node loop bifurcation. As we show, this bifurcation turns out to induce even more drastic changes in spike-based coding than the BT transition. This result arises from a direct effect of the saddle-node loop bifurcation on the limit cycle and hence spike dynamics, in contrast to the BT bifurcation, whose immediate influence is exerted upon the subthreshold dynamics and hence only indirectly relates to spiking. We specifically demonstrate that the saddle-node loop bifurcation (i) ubiquitously occurs in planar neuron models with a saddle-node on invariant cycle onset bifurcation, and (ii) results in a symmetry breaking of the system's phase-response curve. The latter entails close to optimal coding and synchronization properties in event-based information processing units, such as neurons. The saddle-node loop bifurcation leads to a peak in synchronization range and provides an attractive mechanism for the so far unresolved facilitation of high frequencies in neuronal processing. The derived bifurcation structure is of interest in any system for which a relaxation limit is admissible, such as Josephson junctions and chemical oscillators. On the experimental side, our theory applies to optical stimulation of nerve cells, and reveals that these techniques could manipulate a variety of information processing characteristics in nerve cells beyond pure activation.",16,[],10
1604.00919,q-bio,"The Superior Colliculus, a laminar structure involved in the retinotopic mapping of the visual field, plays a cardinal role in the several cortical and subcortical loops of the saccadic system. Although the selection of saccade targets has long been thought to be the sole product of cortical processes, a growing body of evidence hints at the implication of the Superior Colliculus, firstly by the lateral connections between the neurons of its maps, and secondly by its interactions with the midbrain Basal Ganglia, already renowned for their role in decision making. We propose a biomimetic population-coded race model of selection based on a dynamic tecto-basal loop that reproduces the observed ability of the Superior Colliculus to stochastically select between similar stimuli, the accuracy of this selection depending on the discriminability of the target and the distractors. Our model also offers an explanation for the phenomenon of Remote Distractor Effect based on the lateral connectivity within the Basal Ganglia circuitry rather than on lateral inhibitions within the collicular maps. Finally, we propose a role for the intermediate layers of the Superior Colliculus, as stochastic integrators dynamically gated by the selective disinhibition of the Basal Ganglia channels that is consistent with the recorded activity profiles of these neurons.",16,[],10
1605.02251,q-bio,"Expression of many genes varies as a cell transitions through different cell-cycle stages. How coupling between stochastic expression and cell cycle impacts cell-to-cell variability (noise) in the level of protein is not well understood. We analyze a model, where a stable protein is synthesized in random bursts, and the frequency with which bursts occur varies within the cell cycle. Formulas quantifying the extent of fluctuations in the protein copy number are derived and decomposed into components arising from the cell cycle and stochastic processes. The latter stochastic component represents contributions from bursty expression and errors incurred during partitioning of molecules between daughter cells. These formulas reveal an interesting trade-off: cell-cycle dependencies that amplify the noise contribution from bursty expression also attenuate the contribution from partitioning errors. We investigate existence of optimum strategies for coupling expression to the cell cycle that minimize the stochastic component. Intriguingly, results show that a zero production rate throughout the cell cycle, with expression only occurring just before cell division minimizes noise from bursty expression for a fixed mean protein level. In contrast, the optimal strategy in the case of partitioning errors is to make the protein just after cell division. We provide examples of regulatory proteins that are expressed only towards the end of cell cycle, and argue that such strategies enhance robustness of cell-cycle decisions to the intrinsic stochasticity of gene expression.",16,[],10

While this effect is limited to the local genomic region of the sweep in panmictic populations, we find that in spatially-extended populations the combined effects of many unlinked sweeps can affect patterns of ancestry (and therefore neutral genetic diversity) across the whole genome. Even low rates of sweeps can be enough to skew the spatial locations of ancestors such that neutral mutations that occur in an individual living outside a small region in the center of the range have virtually no chance of fixing in the population.",16,[],10
1603.01351,q-bio,"In human studies, how averaged activation in a brain region relates to human behavior has been extensively investigated. This approach has led to the finding that positive and negative facial preferences are represented by different brain regions. However, using a multi-voxel pattern induction method we found that different patterns of neural activations within the cingulate cortex (CC) play roles in representing opposite emotional states. In the present study, while neutrally-preferred faces were presented, activation patterns in the CC that corresponded to higher (or lower) preference were repeatedly induced by the pattern induction method. As a result, previously neutrally-preferred faces became more (or less) preferred. We conclude that a different activation pattern in the CC, rather than averaged activation in a different area, represents and causally determines positive or negative facial preference. This new approach may reveal importance in an activation pattern within a brain region in many cognitive functions.",16,[],10

We perform a mathematical analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of policing. We investigate the selective forces behind policing for both dominant and recessive mutations for different numbers of matings of the queen. The traditional, relatedness-based argument suggests that policing evolves if the queen mates with more than two males, but does not evolve if the queen mates with a single male. We derive precise conditions for the invasion and stability of policing alleles. We find that the relatedness-based argument is not robust with respect to small changes in colony efficiency caused by policing. We also calculate evolutionarily singular strategies and determine when they are evolutionarily stable. We use a population genetics approach that applies to dominant or recessive mutations of any effect size.",16,[],10
1605.07222,q-bio,"We propose a solution to a long standing problem: how to terminate multiple vortices in the heart, when the locations of their cores and their critical time windows are unknown. We scan the phases of all pinned vortices in parallel with electric field pulses (E-pulses). We specify a condition on pacing parameters that guarantees termination of one vortex. For more than one vortex with significantly different frequencies, the success of scanning depends on chance, and all vortices are terminated with a success rate of less than one. We found that a similar mechanism terminates also a free (not pinned) vortex. A series of about 500 experiments with termination of ventricular fibrillation by E-pulses in pig isolated hearts is evidence that pinned vortices, hidden from direct observation, are significant in fibrillation. These results form a physical basis needed for the creation of new effective low energy defibrillation methods based on the termination of vortices underlying fibrillation.",16,[],10
1610.02584,q-bio,"A central question in developmental biology is how size and position are determined. The genetic code carries instructions on how to control these properties in order to regulate the pattern and morphology of structures in the developing organism. Transcription and protein translation mechanisms implement these instructions. However, this cannot happen without some manner of sampling of epigenetic information on the current patterns and morphological forms of structures in the organism. Any rigorous description of space- and time-varying patterns and morphological forms reduces to one among various classes of spatio-temporal partial differential equations. Reaction-transport equations represent one such class. Starting from simple Fickian diffusion, the incorporation of reaction, phase segregation and advection terms can represent many of the patterns seen in the animal and plant kingdoms. Morphological form, requiring the development of three-dimensional structure, also can be represented by these equations of mass transport, albeit to a limited degree. The recognition that physical forces play controlling roles in shaping tissues leads to the conclusion that (nonlinear) elasticity governs the development of morphological form. In this setting, inhomogeneous growth drives the elasticity problem. The combination of reaction-transport equations with those of elasto-growth makes accessible a potentially unlimited spectrum of patterning and morphogenetic phenomena in developmental biology. This perspective communication is a survey of the partial differential equations of mathematical physics that have been proposed to govern patterning and morphogenesis in developmental biology. Several numerical examples are included to illustrate these equations and the corresponding physics, with the intention of providing physical insight wherever possible.",16,[],10

We find that the stationary distribution is non-Poissonian and related to the Bessel function of the first kind.

A better understanding of the pitfalls and the biases in the GO should help users make the most of this very rich resource. We also review some of the misconceptions and misleading assumptions commonly made about GO, including the effect of data incompleteness, the importance of annotation qualifiers, and the transitivity or lack thereof associated with different ontology relations.

1601.07063,q-bio,"How long people live depends on their health, and how it changes with age. Individual health can be tracked by the accumulation of age-related health deficits. The fraction of age-related deficits is a simple quantitative measure of human aging. This quantitative frailty index (F) is as good as chronological age in predicting mortality. In this paper, we use a dynamical network model of deficits to explore the effects of interactions between deficits, deficit damage and repair processes, and the connection between the F and mortality. With our model, we qualitatively reproduce Gompertz's law of increasing human mortality with age, the broadening of the F distribution with age, the characteristic non-linear increase of the F with age, and the increased mortality of high-frailty individuals. No explicit time-dependence in damage or repair rates is needed in our model. Instead, implicit time-dependence arises through deficit interactions -- so that the average deficit damage rates increases, and deficit repair rates decreases, with age . We use a simple mortality criterion, where mortality occurs when the most connected node is damaged.",16,[],10
1603.04518,q-bio,"Despite major advances in quantitative approaches to natural resource management, there has been resistance to using these tools in the actual practice of managing ecological populations. Given a managed system and a set of assumptions, translated into a model, optimization methods can be used to solve for the most cost effective management actions. However, when the underlying assumptions are not met, such methods can potentially lead to poor decisions. Managers who develop decisions based on past experience and judgment, without the aid of mathematical models, can potentially learn about the system and develop flexible management strategies. However, these strategies are often based on subjective criteria and equally invalid and often unstated assumptions. Given the drawbacks of both methods, it is unclear whether simple quantitative models improve environmental decision making over expert opinion. In this paper, we explore how well students, using their experience and judgment, manage simulated fishery populations in an online computer game and compare their management outcomes to the performance of model-based decisions. We consider harvest decisions generated using four different quantitative models: 1. the model used to produce the simulated population dynamics observed in the game, with all underlying parameter values known [a control], 2. the same model, but with unknown parameter values that must be estimated during the game from observed data, 3. models that are structurally different from those used to simulate the population dynamics and 4. a model that ignores age structure.

1606.06668,q-bio,"We report a new mechanism for allelic dominance in regulatory genetic interactions that we call binding dominance. We investigated a biophysical model of gene regulation, where the fractional occupancy of a transcription factor (TF) on the cis-regulated promoter site it binds to is determined by binding energy (-letterG) and TF dosage. Transcription and gene expression proceed when the TF is bound to the promoter. In diploids, individuals may be heterozygous at the cis-site, at the TF's coding region, or at the TF's own promoter, which determines allele-specific dosage. We find that when the TF's coding region is heterozygous, TF alleles compete for occupancy at the cis sites and the tighter-binding TF is dominant in proportion to the difference in binding strength. When the TF's own promoter is heterozygous, the TF produced at the higher dosage is also dominant. Cis-site heterozygotes have additive expression and therefore codominant phenotypes. Binding dominance propagates to affect the expression of downstream loci and it is sensitive in both magnitude and direction to genetic background, but its detectability often attenuates. While binding dominance is inevitable at the molecular level, it is difficult to detect in the phenotype under some biophysical conditions, more so when TF dosage is high and allele-specific binding affinities are similar. A body of empirical research on the biophysics of TF binding demonstrates the plausibility of this mechanism of dominance, but studies of gene expression under competitive binding in heterozygotes in a diversity of genetic backgrounds are needed.",16,[],10

Specifically, we use average Lyapunov functions and Morse decompositions to develop sufficient and necessary conditions for robust permanence, a form of coexistence robust to large perturbations of the population densities and small structural perturbations of the models. We illustrate how our results can be applied to verify permanence in non-autonomous models, structured population models, including those with frequency-dependent feedbacks, and models of eco-evolutionary dynamics.

1612.04682,q-bio,"A basal animal model is described as an organism similar to a Limpet that is attached to the sea floor living in a reproductive community. Its brain model uses logic cells (gates) to create a high frequency spike generator. Addition logic cells create a timing framework based upon Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), and create multi-cell, spike driven muscle actuators and bi-directional shift registers that serve as memories. Together, these logic cells generate a pulse train that forms a recurrent fractal in the form of coherent square waves that consist of an equal number of set pulses and reset pulses. These pulses drive the actuators that pump water and food through its shell. Some of these individuals lose their permanent attachment to the sea floor, and evolve the ability to move around using the feeding motions. This creates the hazard of getting stuck against an object or moving away from its breeding community. They evolve a sensor system and logic cells that produce a restoring motion for each avoidance motion. This keeps the animal in the specific region of an object that it encounters (hefting), and maintains the zero sum (coherence) of the fractal, and connects the organism cyberneticly to objects that are sensed in its environment. The logic units evolve to store permanent memories, and add plus and minus pulse trains together into a single pulse train that allow the animal to follow a moving object (imprinting). Additional logic units evolve that allow the animal to heft using contacts with multiple objects that allow the animal to return to its point of origin (reproductive migration) using permanent memories that are created when a pulse is not reset to zero.So, information is stored in multiple logic cells instead of a connection to one logic cell, and is based upon spike timing rather than static (synaptic) connections between cells.",16,[],10

Analogous to genomic sequence alignment, NA can be used to transfer biological knowledge from well- to poorly-studied species between aligned network regions.

Existing MNA methods aim to maximize total similarity over all aligned nodes (node conservation). Then, they evaluate alignment quality by measuring the amount of conserved edges, but only after the alignment is constructed. Directly optimizing edge conservation during alignment construction in addition to node conservation may result in superior alignments. Thus, we present a novel MNA approach called multiMAGNA that can achieve this. Indeed, multiMAGNA generally outperforms or is on par with the existing MNA methods, while often completing faster than the existing methods.

1608.08498,q-bio,"Species or population that proliferate faster than others become dominant in numbers. Catalysis allows catalytic sets within a molecular reaction network to dominate the non catalytic parts of the network by processing most of the available substrate. As a consequence one may consider a 'catalytic fitness' of sets of molecular species. The fittest sets emerge as the expressed chemical backbone or sub-network of larger chemical reaction networks employed by organisms. However, catalytic fitness depends on the systemic context and the stability of systemic dynamics. Unstable reaction networks would easily be reshaped or destroyed by fluctuations of the chemical environment. In this paper we therefore focus on recognizing systemic stability as an evolutionary selection criterion. In fact, instabilities of regulatory systems dynamics become predictive for associated evolutionary forces driving the emergence large reaction networks that avoid or control inherent instabilities. Systemic instabilities can be identified and analyzed using relatively simple mathematical random networks models of complex regulatory systems. Using a statistical ensemble approach one can identify fundamental causes of instable dynamics, infer evolutionary preferred network properties, and predict evolutionary emergent control mechanisms and their entanglement with cell differentiation processes. Surprisingly, what systemic stability tells us here is that cells (or other non-linear regulatory systems) never had to learn how to differentiate, but rather how to avoid and control differentiation.

Here, by implementing a simple model in one and two dimensions, we compare and contrast receptor-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis for a range of biologically relevant shapes, including spheres, ellipsoids, capped cylinders, and hourglasses. We find a whole range of different engulfment behaviors with some ellipsoids engulfing faster than spheres, and that phagocytosis is able to engulf a greater range of target shapes than other types of endocytosis. Further, the 2D model can explain why some nonspherical particles engulf fastest (not at all) when presented to the membrane tip-first (lying flat).

1611.03605,q-bio,"This paper states the case for applying the conceptual and analytic tools associated with the study of entropy in physical systems to cognition, focusing on creative cognition.

Thus, intrinsically motivated creativity begins with detection of high psychological entropy material (e.g., a question or inconsistency), which provokes uncertainty and is arousal-inducing. This material is recursively considering from new contexts until it is sufficiently restructured that arousal dissipates and entropy reaches an acceptable level. Restructuring involves neural synchrony and dynamic binding, and may be facilitated by temporarily shifting to a more associative mode of thought. The creative outcome may similarly induce restructuring in others, and thereby contribute to the cultural evolution of more nuanced understandings. Thus, the concept of entropy could play a unifying role in cognitive science as a driver of thought and action, and in cultural studies as the driver of the creative innovations that fuel cultural evolution.

1603.09415,q-bio,"Traditionally, studies of coevolving systems have considered cases where a parasite may inhabit only a single host. The case where a parasite may infect many hosts, widespread parasitism, has until recently gained little traction. This is due in part to the computational complexity involved in reconstructing the coevolutionary histories where parasites may infect only a single host, which is NP-Hard. Allowing parasites to inhabit more than one host has been seen to only further compound this computationally intractable problem. Recently however, well-established algorithms for estimating the problem instance where a parasite may infect only a single host have been extended to handle widespread parasites. Although this has offered significant progress, it has been noted that these algorithms poorly handle parasites that inhabit phylogenetically distant hosts.   In this work we extend these previous algorithms to handle cases where parasites inhabit phylogenetically distant hosts using an additional evolutionary event which we call spread. Our new framework is shown to infer significantly more congruent coevolutionary histories compared to existing methods over both synthetic and biological data sets. We then apply the newly proposed algorithm, which we call WiSPA (WideSpread Parasitism Analyser), to the well studied coevolutionary system of Primates and Enterobius (pinworms), where existing methods have been unable to reconcile the widespread parasitism present without permitting additional divergence events.

We propose modulated experiments to explore the PEIT in an alternative way by periodically modulating the coupling and the probe fields in a ?-type three-level system. Our analytical and numerical results rule out the ATS interpretation and show that the QDI interpretation is more appropriate for the modulated experiments. The proposed experiments are readily implemented in atomic gases, artificial atoms in superconducting quantum devices, or three-level meta-atoms in meta-materials.",16,[],6
1603.00758,quant-ph,"On this work, we consider a particle moving in front of a dielectric plate, and study two of the most relevant effects of the vacuum field fluctuations: the dissipation, and the decoherence of the particle's internal degrees of freedom. We consider the particle to follow a classical, macroscopically-fixed trajectory. To study the dissipative effects, we calculate the in-out effective action by functionally integrating over the vacuum field and the microscopic degrees of freedom of both the plate and the particle. This in-out effective action develops an imaginary part, hence a non-vanishing probability for the decay (because of friction) of the initial vacuum state. We analyze how the dissipation is affected by the relative velocity between the particle and the plate and the properties of the microscopic degrees of freedom. In order to study the effects of decoherence over the internal degrees of freedom of the particle, we calculate the CTP or Schwinger-Keldysh influence action, by functionally integrating over the vacuum field and the microscopic degrees of freedom of the plate. We estimate the decoherence time as the time needed by two different quantum configurations (of the internal degree of freedom of the particle) to be possible to differentiate from one another. We analyze the way in which the presence of the mirror affects the decoherence, and the possible ways to maximize or reduce its effects.",16,[],6
1608.03669,quant-ph,"We propose an effective and flexible scheme for reverse engineering of a Hamiltonian by designing the evolution operators to eliminate the terms of Hamiltonian which are hard to be realized in practice. Different from transitionless quantum driving (TQD) [31], the present scheme is focus on only one or parts of moving states in a D-dimension (D > 3) system. The numerical simulation shows that the present scheme not only contains the results of TQD, but also has more free parameters, which make this scheme more flexible. An example is given by using this scheme to realize the population transfer for a Rydberg atom. The influences of various decoherence processes are discussed by numerical simulation and the result shows that the scheme is fast and robust against the decoherence and operational imperfection. Therefore, this scheme may be used to construct a Hamiltonian which can be realized in experiments",16,[],6

Moreover, we explain how time-correlation functions could be exploited for the quantum simulation of open quantum dynamics, and we provide an experimental recipe for the measurement of entanglement monotones in trapped ion technologies. On the other hand, we explore the quantum simulation of quantum optical models of light-matter interaction for inaccessible coupling regimes, providing experimental proposals for their implementation, both in ions and superconducting circuits.

1605.08384,quant-ph,"Many protocols of quantum information processing, like quantum key distribution or measurement-based quantum computation, ""consume"" entangled quantum states during their execution. When participants are located at distant sites, these resource states need to be distributed. Due to transmission losses quantum repeater become necessary for large distances (e.g. equation 300 km). Here we generalize the concept of the graph state repeater to equation-dimensional graph states and to repeaters that can perform basic measurement-based quantum computations, which we call quantum routers. This processing of data at intermediate network nodes is called quantum network coding. We describe how a scheme to distribute general two-colorable graph states via quantum routers with network coding can be constructed from classical linear network codes. The robustness of the distribution of graph states against outages of network nodes is analysed by establishing a link to stabilizer error correction codes. Furthermore we show, that for any stabilizer error correction code there exists a corresponding quantum network code with similar error correcting capabilities.",16,[],6

1601.02741,quant-ph,"Quantum coherence as the fundamental characteristic of quantum physics, provides the valuable resource for quantum computation in exceeding the power of classical algorithms. The exploration of quantum coherence in relativistic systems is of significance from both the fundamental points of view and practical applications. We investigate the quantum coherence of two free modes of scalar and Dirac fields as detected by two relatively accelerated observers by resorting to the relative entropy of coherence. We show that the relative entropy of coherence monotonically decreases when acceleration goes up, as a consequence of the Unruh effect. Specifically, the initial states with parameters equation and equation have the same initial relative entropy coherence at equation (with equation the acceleration), but degrade along two different trajectories. The relative entropy of coherence reaches vanishing value in the scalar field in the infinite acceleration limit, but non-vanishing value in the Dirac field. This suggests that in the Dirac field, the bipartite state possesses quantum coherence to some extent with the variation of the relative acceleration, and may lead to potential applications in quantum computation performed by observers in motion relatively.",16,[],6

A remarkable example of multi-partite correlations is exhibited by the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. In a GHZ state, three particles are correlated while no pairwise correlation is found. The manifestation of these strong correlations in an interferometric setting has been studied theoretically since 1990 but no three-photon GHZ interferometer has been realized experimentally. Here we demonstrate three-photon interference that does not originate from two-photon or single photon interference. We observe phase-dependent variation of three-photon coincidences with 90.5  5.0 % visibility in a generalized Franson interferometer using energy-time entangled photon triplets.

1608.02677,quant-ph,"We study theoretically the possibilities of coupling the quantum mechanical motion of a trapped charged particle (e.g. ion or electron) to quantum degrees of freedom of superconducting devices, nano-mechanical resonators and quartz bulk acoustic wave resonators. For each case, we estimate the coupling rate between the charged particle and its macroscopic counterpart and compare it to the decoherence rate, i.e. the rate at which quantum superposition decays. A hybrid system can only be considered quantum if the coupling rate significantly exceeds all decoherence rates. Our approach is to examine specific examples, using parameters that are experimentally attainable in the foreseeable future. We conclude that those hybrid quantum system considered involving an atomic ion are unfavorable, compared to using an electron, since the coupling rates between the charged particle and its counterpart are slower than the expected decoherence rates. A system based on trapped electrons, on the other hand, might have coupling rates which significantly exceed decoherence rates. Moreover it might have appealing properties such as fast entangling gates, long coherence and flexible electron interconnectivity topology. Realizing such a system, however, is technologically challenging, since it requires accommodating both trapping technology and superconducting circuitry in a compatible manner. We review some of the challenges involved, such as the required trap parameters, electron sources, electrical circuitry and cooling schemes in order to promote further investigations towards the realization of such a hybrid system.",16,[],6
1603.04346,quant-ph,"A universal and optimal method for the polarimetry of light with arbitrary photon statistics is presented. The method is based on the continuous maximum-likelihood positive operator-valued measure (ML-POVM) for pure polarization states over the surface of the Bloch sphere. The success probability and the mean fidelity are used as the figures of merit to show its performance. The POVM is found to attain the collective bound of polarization estimation with respect to the mean fidelity. As demonstrations, explicit results for the N photon Fock state, the phase-randomized coherent state (Poisson distribution), and the thermal light are obtained. It is found that the estimation performances for the Fock state and the Poisson distribution are almost identical, while that for the thermal light is much worse. This suggests that thermal light leaks less information to an eavesdropper and hence could potentially provide more security in polarization-encoded quantum communication protocols than a single-mode laser beam as customarily considered. Finally, comparisons against an optimal adaptive measurement with classical communications are made to show the better and more stable performance of the continuous ML-POVM.",16,[],6

1610.05384,quant-ph,"To the working physicist, anyon theory is meant to describe certain quasi-particle excitations occurring in two dimensional topologically ordered systems.

Although there is a powerful string-diagram notation that greatly assists these manipulations, we still appear to be operating on particles arranged on a one-dimensional line, algebraically ordered from left to right. The obvious question is, where is the other dimension? The topological framework for considering these anyons as truly living in a two dimensional space is known as a modular functor, or topological quantum field theory.

We showed that these correlations can be mapped on the longitudinal spin waves of the memory cell and be restored later in the readout light. The efficiencies of the writing and readout depend on the mode structure of the memory determined by a mechanism of the light-matter interaction under consideration (the non-resonance Raman interaction) and by the profile of the driving light field. We showed that like the initial light pulse train, the restored one can be represented by a set of squeezed supermodes. The mapping of the quantum multimode correlations on the material medium offers opportunities to manipulate the quantum states within the memory cell followed by the reading of the transformed state.",16,[],6

Our result is non-perturbative in the qubit-coupler coupling strengths and in the coupler nonlinearity. This can lead to significant departures from previous, linear theories for the inter-qubit coupling, including non-stoquastic and many-body interactions. Our analysis provides explicit and efficiently computable series for any term in the interaction Hamiltonian and can be applied to any superconducting qubit type.

For instance, when the light bounces on a movable mirror, its intensity is not perturbed (the effect is just seen on the phase of the radiation), but the radiation pressure allows to trace back its fluctuations by observing the mirror motion. In this work, we implement a cavity opto-mechanical experiment based on an oscillating micro-mirror, and we measure correlations between the output light intensity fluctuations and the mirror motion.

In the presence of this systematic error, the transformation produced by the non-adiabatic non-Abelian geometric gate is not unitary in the computational space, and the resulting gate infidelity is larger than that with the dynamical method.

Here, we develop an efficient iterative method capable of evaluating the probability of a graph being strongly connected. It is proven that random directed graphs with constant edge-establishing probability are typically strongly connected, i.e. any ordered pair of vertices is connected by a directed path. This typical topological property of directed random graphs is exploited to demonstrate universal features of the asymptotic evolution of large random qubit networks.

Here we present clean protocols for calculating the Inner Product of two equation-bit strings, showing that (in the absence of pre-shared entanglement) at most equation qubits or equation bits of communication are required. The quantum protocol provides inspiration for obtaining the optimal method to implement distributed CNOT gates in parallel whilst minimizing the amount of quantum communication.

With these restraints, one can find Laurent polynomials for various equation -- queries -- and equation -- database sizes -- thus finding larger recursive sets to solve the OSP and effectively reducing the upper bound. These polynomials are found to be convex functions, allowing one to make use of convex optimization to find an improvement on the known bounds. According to [A.

We find the domain in the control parameter space yielding (i) zero entanglement between the sender and receiver during the whole evolution period and (ii) non-vanishing informational correlation between the sender and receiver, thus showing that the informational correlation is responsible for the remote state creation. Among the control parameters, there are the strong parameters (which strongly effect the values of studied measures) and the weak ones (whose effect is negligible), therewith the eigenvalues of the initial state are given a privileged role.

1603.08718,quant-ph,"We consider a time dependent trap externally manipulated in such a way that one of its bound states is brought into an instant contact with the continuum threshold, and then down again. It is shown that, in the limit of slow evolution, the probability to remain in the bound state, equation tends to a universal limit, and is determined only by the manner in which the adiabatic bound state approaches and leaves the threshold. The task of evaluating the equation in the adiabatic limit can be reduced to studying the loss from a zero range well, and is performed numerically. Various types of trapping potentials are considered. Applications of the theory to cold atoms in traps, and to propagation of traversal modes in tapered wave guides are proposed.",16,[],6
1604.07141,quant-ph,"The quantum backflow effect is a counterintuitive behavior of the probability current of a free particle, which may be negative even for states with vanishing negative momentum component. Here we address the notion of nonclassicality arising from the backflow effect, i.e. from the negativity of the probability current, and analyze its relationships with the notion of nonclassicality based on the negativity of the Wigner function. Our results suggest that backflow is linked to a different, and in fact more restrictive, notion of nonclassicality, the negativity of the Wigner function being only a necessary prerequisite for its occurrence. This hierarchical structure may be confirmed by looking at the addition of thermal noise, which more easily destroys the negativity of the probability current than the negativity of the Wigner function itself.",16,[],6
1606.00029,quant-ph,"We describe a general approach to proving the impossibility of implementing a quantum channel by local operations and classical communication (LOCC), even with an infinite number of rounds, and find that this can often be demonstrated by solving a set of linear equations. The method also allows one to design an LOCC protocol to implement the channel whenever such a protocol exists in any finite number of rounds. Perhaps surprisingly, the computational expense for analyzing LOCC channels is not much greater than that for LOCC measurements. We apply the method to several examples, two of which provide numerical evidence that the set of quantum channels that are not LOCC is not closed and that there exist channels that can be implemented by LOCC either in one round or in three rounds that are on the boundary of the set of all LOCC channels.   Although every LOCC protocol must implement a separable quantum channel, it is a very difficult task to determine whether or not a given channel is separable. Fortunately, prior knowledge that the channel is separable is not required for application of our method.",16,[],6
1610.04524,quant-ph,"In this paper, we study theoretically the optomechanical interaction of an almost pure condensate of photons with an oscillating mechanical membrane in a micro-cavity. We show that in the Bogoliubov approximation, due to the large number of photons in the condensate phase, there is a linear strong effective coupling between the Bogoliubov mode of the photonic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and the mechanical motion of the membrane which depends on the nonlinear photon-photon scattering potential. This coupling leads to the cooling of the mechanical motion, the normal mode splitting (NMS), the squeezing of the output field and the entanglement between the excited mode of the cavity and the mechanical mode. We show that, in one hand, the nonlinearity of the photon gas increases the degree of the squeezing of the output field of the micro-cavity and the efficiency of the cooling process at high temperatures. In the other hand, it reduces NMS in the displacement spectrum of the oscillating membrane and the degree of the optomechanical entanglement. In addition, the temperature of the photonic BEC can be used to control the above-mentioned phenomena.",16,[],6
1605.02303,quant-ph,"Multimode entanglement is quintessential for the design and fabrication of quantum networks, which play a central role in quantum information processing and quantum metrology. However, an experimental setup is generally constructed with a specific network configuration in mind and therefore exhibits reduced versatility and scalability. The present work demonstrates an on-demand, reconfigurable quantum network simulator, using an intrinsically multimode quantum resource and a homodyne detection apparatus. Without altering either the initial squeezing source or experimen- tal architecture, we realize the construction of thirteen cluster states of various size and connectivity as well as the implementation of a secret sharing protocol.

1610.01056,quant-ph,"Proofs of the security of quantum key distribution are propositions about models written in the mathematical language of quantum mechanics, and the issue is the linking of such models to actual devices in an experiment on security.

We sketch concepts with which to think about models in relation to experiments, without assuming the experiments accord with any model included is a concept of one quantum-mechanical model enveloping another. For any model that agrees with given experimental results and implies the security of a key, there is an enveloping model that agrees with the same results while denying that security. As a result there is a gap between equations and the behavior recorded from devices in an experiment, a gap bridged only by resort to something beyond the reach of logic and measured data, well named by the word guesswork.   While this recognition of guesswork encourages eavesdropping, a related recognition of guesswork in the design of feedback loops can help a transmitter and receiver to reduce their vulnerability to eavesdropping.",16,[],6

This approach is clearly different from classical realism, but it does define a meaningful ""quantum realism"" from a general philosophical point of view. Consistently with Bell test experiments, this quantum realism embeds some form of non-locality, but does not contain any action at a distance, in agreement with quantum mechanics.",16,[],6
1610.09619,quant-ph,"In the early days of quantum mechanics, it was believed that the time energy uncertainty principle (TEUP) bounds the efficiency of energy measurements, relating the duration (equation) of the measurement, and its accuracy error (equation) by equation 1/2. In 1961 Y. Aharonov and Bohm gave a counterexample, whereas Aharonov, Massar and Popescu [2002] showed that under certain conditions the principle holds. Can we classify when and to what extent the TEUP is violated?   Our main theorem asserts that such violations are in one to one correspondence with the ability to ""fast forward"" the associated Hamiltonian, namely, to simulate its evolution for time equation using much less than equation quantum gates. This intriguingly links precision measurements with quantum algorithms. Our theorem is stated in terms of a modified TEUP, which we call the computational TEUP (cTEUP). In this principle the time duration (equation) is replaced by the number of quantum gates required to perform the measurement, and we argue why this is more suitable to study if one is to understand the totality of physical resources required to perform an accurate measurement. The inspiration for this result is a family of Hamiltonians we construct, based on Shor's algorithm, which exponentially violate the cTEUP (and the TEUP), thus allowing exponential fast forwarding.   We further show that commuting local Hamiltonians and quadratic Hamiltonians of fermions (e.g., Anderson localization model), can be fast forwarded. The work raises the question of finding a physical criterion for fast forwarding, in particular, can many body localization systems be fast forwarded? We rule out a general fast-forwarding method for all physically realizable Hamiltonians (unless BQP=PSPACE). Connections to quantum metrology and to Susskind's complexification of a wormhole's length are discussed.",16,[],6
1608.08192,quant-ph,"Quantum spin networks overcome the challenges of traditional charge-based electronics by encoding the information into spin degrees of freedom. Although beneficial for transmitting information with minimal losses when compared to their charge-based counterparts, the mathematical formalization of the information propagation in a spin(tronic) network is challenging due to its complicated scaling properties. In this paper, we propose a geometric approach---specific to finite networks---for unraveling the information-theoretic phenomena of spin chains and rings by abstracting them as weighted graphs, where the vertices correspond to the spin excitation states and the edges represent the information theoretic distance between pair of nodes. The weighted graph representation of the quantum spin network dynamics exhibits a complex self-similar structure (where subgraphs repeat to some extent over various space scales). To quantify this complex behavior, we develop a new box counting inspired algorithm which assesses the mono-fractal versus multi-fractal properties of quantum spin networks. Besides specific to finite networks, multi-fractality is further compounded by ""engineering"" or ""biasing"" the network for selective transfer, as selectivity makes the network more heterogeneous. To demonstrate criticality in finite size systems, we define a thermodynamics inspired framework for describing information propagation and show evidence that some spin chains and rings exhibit an informational phase transition phenomenon, akin to the metal-to-insulator phase transition in Anderson localization in finite media.",16,[],6
1603.09214,quant-ph,"In 1954, Dicke predicted that a system of quantum emitters confined to a subwavelength volume would produce a superradiant burst. For such a burst to occur, the emitters must be in the special Dicke state with zero dipole moment. We show that a superradiant burst may also arise for non-Dicke initial states with nonzero dipole moment. Both for Dicke and non-Dicke initial states, superradiance arises due to a decrease in the dispersion of the quantum phase of the emitter state. For non-Dicke states, the quantum phase is related to the phase of long-period envelopes which modulate the oscillations of the dipole moments. A decrease in dispersion of the quantum phase causes a decrease in the dispersion of envelope phases that results in constructive interference of the envelopes and the superradiant burst.",16,[],6

Two nonlinear optical crystals, positioned back-to-back in the waist of a pump beam, function as single-pass degenerate optical parametric amplifiers and produce single-mode squeezed vacuum states in orthogonal polarization modes, but in the same spatiotemporal mode. A subsequent pair of waveplates acts as a beam splitter, entangling the two polarization modes to generate the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen state. This technique takes advantage of the strong nonlinearity associated with type-I phase-matching configuration while at the same time eliminating the need for actively stabilizing the optical phase between the two squeezers, which typically arises if these squeezers are spatially separated.

When we require that all Grover iterations use the same crystal, and account for potential experimental limitations on crystal-length precision, our optimized conversion efficiencies reach unity for equation, after which they decrease monotonically for equation values up to 50, which is the upper limit of our numerical dynamics evaluations. Nevertheless, our conversion efficiencies remain higher than those for a conventional (no NSGs) down-converter.",16,[],6

Due to the gain of the optical parametric amplifier and the phase of the pump driving the optical parametric amplifier can simultaneously modulate the squeezing cavity field, the radiation pressure interaction between the cavity field and the oscillator is modulated accordingly. We find that there is competing effect between the radiation pressure interaction and the Coulomb interaction for the oscillator which these two interactions act on simultaneously. Therefore, the modulation of entanglement can be achieved with the assistance of Coulomb interaction. The results of numerical simulation show that the present scheme has stronger robustness against the temperature of environment compared with previous schemes in experimentally feasible regimes.",16,[],6

This is ideal for the faithful transmission of information, but prohibits an interaction between the photons as required for a plethora of applications in optical quantum information processing. The long-standing challenge here is to realise a deterministic photon-photon gate. This requires an interaction so strong that the two photons can shift each others phase by pi. For polarisation qubits, this amounts to the conditional flipping of one photon's polarisation to an orthogonal state. So far, only probabilistic gates based on linear optics and photon detectors could be realised, as ""no known or foreseen material has an optical nonlinearity strong enough to implement this conditional phase shift...""

1611.05411,quant-ph,"One of the main figures of merit for quantum memories and quantum communication devices is their quantum capacity. It has been studied for arbitrary kinds of quantum channels, but its practical estimation has so far been limited to devices that implement independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) quantum channels, where each qubit is affected by the same noise process. Real devices, however, typically exhibit correlated errors.   Here, we overcome this limitation by presenting protocols that estimate a channel's one-shot quantum capacity for the case where the device acts on (an arbitrary number of) qubits. The one-shot quantum capacity quantifies a device's ability to store or communicate quantum information, even if there are correlated errors across the different qubits.   We present a protocol which is easy to implement and which comes in two versions. The first version estimates the one-shot quantum capacity by preparing and measuring in two different bases, where all involved qubits are used as test qubits. The second version verifies on-the-fly that a channel's one-shot quantum capacity exceeds a minimal tolerated value while storing or communicating data, therefore combining test qubits and data qubits in one protocol.
