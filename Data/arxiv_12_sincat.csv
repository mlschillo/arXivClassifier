1211.3862,astro-ph,"We study the evolution of the Earth collision probability of asteroid 2008 TC3 using a short observational arc and small numbers of observations. To assess impact probability, we use techniques that rely on the orbital-element probability density function characterized using both Markov-chain Monte-Carlo orbital ranging and Monte-Carlo ranging. First, we evaluate the orbital uncertainties for the object from the night of discovery onwards and examine the collapse of the orbital-element distributions in time. Second, we examine the sensitivity of the results to the assumed astrometric noise. Each of the orbits obtained from the MCMC ranging method is propagated into the future (within chosen time bounds of the expected impact), and the collision probability is calculated as a weighted fraction of the orbits leading to a collision from the Earth. We compare the results obtained with both methods.",12,[],1
1203.0344,astro-ph,"From H\alpha narrow band observations, we identified three H\alpha emitting regions in the direction of Magellanic Stream IV (MS IV). They consist of three parallel filaments with 2 arcmin width and 6 -- 30 arcmin length at 12 arcmin intervals. The mean surface brightness of them is equation erg sequation cmequation arcsecequation. Because of their low surface brightness, the regions were not detected in previous H\alpha surveys. In HI map, the position of the filaments overlap MS, suggesting that they are parts of MS, but there also exists a local HI structure. If the filaments associate with MS, the sizes are 30 pc equation 100 -- 500 pc. The filaments lie at the leading edge of a downstream cloud, which supports a shock heating and its propagation (shock cascade) model for the ionizing source. If they are local objects, on the other hand, Fossil Stromgren Trails of more than two stars is a possible interpretation, and the sizes would be 0.1 pc equation 0.3 -- 1.5 pc at 180 pc distance. The positional information of the H\alpha filaments presented in this letter enables us future spectroscopic observations to clarify their nature.",12,[],1
1204.6359,astro-ph,"Time delay in galaxy gravitational lensing systems has been used to determine the value of Hubble constant. As in other dynamical phenomena at the scale of galaxy, dark matter is often invoked in gravitational lensing to account for the ""missing mass"" (the apparent discrepancy between the dynamical mass and the luminous mass). Alternatively, modified gravity can be used to explain the discrepancy. In this paper we adopt the Tensor-Vector-Scalar gravity (TeVeS), a relativistic version of MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), to study gravitational lensing phenomena and derive the formulae needed to evaluate the Hubble constant. We test our method on quasar lensing by elliptical galaxies in the literature. We focus on double-image systems with time delay measurement. Three candidates are suitable for our study: HE 2149-2745, FBQ J09512635 and SBS 0909532. The Hubble constant obtained is consistent with the value used in fitting the CMB result in neutrino cosmological model.",12,[],1
1210.4827,astro-ph,"Via joint analysis of a calibrated telescopic survey, which found scattering Kuiper Belt objects, and models of their expected orbital distribution, we measure the form of the scattering object's size distribution. Ruling out a single power-law at greater than 99% confidence, we constrain the form of the size distribution and find that, surprisingly, our analysis favours a very sudden decrease (a divot) in the number distribution as diameters decrease below 100 km, with the number of smaller objects then rising again as expected via collisional equilibrium. Extrapolating at this collisional equilibrium slope produced enough kilometer-scale scattering objects to supply the nearby Jupiter-Family comets. Our interpretation is that this divot feature is a preserved relic of the size distribution made by planetesimal formation, now ""frozen in"" to portions of the Kuiper Belt sharing a ""hot"" orbital inclination distribution, explaining several puzzles in Kuiper Belt science. Additionally, we show that to match today's scattering-object inclination distribution, the supply source that was scattered outward must have already been vertically heated to of order 10 degrees.",12,[],1
1210.1641,astro-ph,"In the era of precision cosmology the Virgo cluster takes on a new role in the cosmic distance scale. Its traditional role of testing the consistency of secondary distance indicators is replaced by an ensemble of distance measurements within the Local Supercluster united by a velocity field model obtained from redshift survey based reconstruction. WMAP leads us to see the Hubble Constant as one of six parameters in a standard model of cosmology with considerable covariance between parameters. Independent experiments, such as WMAP and the HST Key Project (and their successors) constrain these parameters.",12,[],1
1209.3858,astro-ph,"We have developed a multi-pixel beamformer technique, which can be used for enhancing the capabilities for studying pulsars using an interferometric array. Using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), we illustrate the application of this efficient technique, which combines the enhanced sensitivity of a coherent array beamformer with the wide field-of-view seen by an incoherent array beamformer. Multi-pixel beamformer algorithm is implemented using the recorded base-band data. With the optimisations in multi-pixelisation described in this paper, it is now possible to form 16 directed beams in real-time. We discuss a special application of this technique, where we use continuum imaging followed by the multi-pixel beamformer to obtain the precise locations of newly discovered millisecond pulsars with the GMRT. Accurate positions measured with single observations enable highly sensitive follow-up studies using coherent array beamformer and rapid follow up at higher radio frequencies and other wavelengths. Normally, such accurate positions can only be obtained from a long-term pulsar timing program. The multi-pixel beamformer technique can also be used for highly sensitive targeted pulsar searches in extended supernova remnants. In addition this method can provide optimal performance for the large scale pulsar surveys using multi-element arrays.",12,[],1
1204.0310,astro-ph,"We show that an upper limit on the maximum brightness temperature for a self-absorbed incoherent synchrotron radio source is obtained from the size of its gyro orbits, which in turn must lie well within the confines of the total source extent. These temperature limits are obtained without recourse to inverse Compton effects or the condition of equipartition of energy between magnetic fields and relativistic particles. For radio variables, the intra-day variability (IDV) implies brightness temperatures equation K in the co-moving rest frame of the source. This, if interpreted purely due to an incoherent synchrotron emission, would imply gyro radii equation cm, the size of the universe, while from the causality arguments the inferred maximum size of the source in such a case is equation cm. Such high brightness temperatures are sometimes modeled in the literature as some coherent emission process where bunches of non-thermal particles are somehow formed that radiate in phase. We show that, unlike in case of curvature radiation models proposed in pulsars, in the synchrotron radiation mechanism the oppositely charged particles would contribute together to the coherent phenomenon without the need to form separate bunches of the opposite charges. At the same time we show that bunches would disperse over dimensions larger than a wavelength in time shorter than the gyro orbital period (equation sec). Therefore a coherent emission by bunches cannot be a plausible explanation of the high brightness temperatures inferred in extragalactic radio sources showing variability over a few hours or longer.",12,[],1
1209.1898,astro-ph,"Collapse and fragmentation of primordial filamentary clouds under isotropic dissociation radiation is investigated with one-dimensional hydrodynamical calculations. We investigate the effect of dissociation photon on the filamentary clouds with calculating non-equilibrium chemical reactions. With the external radiation assumed to turn on when the filamentary cloud forms, the filamentary cloud with low initial density (equation) suffers photodissociation of hydrogen molecules. In such a case, since main coolant is lost, temperature increases adiabatically enough to suppress collapse. As a result, the filamentary cloud fragments into very massive clouds (equation). On the other hand, the evolution of the filamentary clouds with high initial density (equation) is hardly affected by the external radiation. This is because the filamentary cloud with high initial density shields itself from the external radiation. It is found that the external radiation increases fragment mass. This result is consistent with previous results with one-zone models. It is also found that fragment mass decreases owing to the external dissociation radiation in the case with sufficiently large line mass.",12,[],1
1206.1177,astro-ph,"We report the discovery of WASP-78b and WASP-79b, two highly-bloated Jupiter-mass exoplanets orbiting F-type host stars. WASP-78b orbits its V=12.0 host star (TYC 5889-271-1) every 2.175 days and WASP-79b orbits its V=10.1 host star (CD-30 1812) every 3.662 days. Planetary parameters have been determined using a simultaneous fit to WASP and TRAPPIST transit photometry and CORALIE radial-velocity measurements. For WASP-78b a planetary mass of 0.89 /- 0.08 MJup and a radius of 1.70 /- 0.11 RJup is found. The planetary equilibrium temperature of TP = 2350 /- 80 K for WASP-78b makes it one of the hottest of the currently known exoplanets. WASP-79b its found to have a planetary mass of 0.90 /- 0.08 MJup, but with a somewhat uncertain radius due to lack of sufficient TRAPPIST photometry. The planetary radius is at least 1.70 /- 0.11 RJup, but could be as large as 2.09 /- 0.14 RJup, which would make WASP-79b the largest known exoplanet.",12,[],1
1210.0318,astro-ph,"We review the current status of studies of disc atmospheres and winds in low mass X-ray binaries. We discuss the possible wind launching mechanisms and compare the predictions of the models with the existent observations. We conclude that a combination of thermal and radiative pressure (the latter being relevant at high luminosities) can explain the current observations of atmospheres and winds in both neutron star and black hole binaries. Moreover, these winds and atmospheres could contribute significantly to the broad iron emission line observed in these systems.",12,[],1
1203.3582,astro-ph,"GRS 1915105 is a widely studied black hole binary, well known because of its extremely fast and complex variability. Flaring periods of high variability alternate with ""stable"" phases (the plateaux) when the flux is low, the spectra are hard and the timing properties of the source are similar to those of a number of black hole candidates in hard spectral state. In the plateaux the power density spectra are dominated by a low frequency quasi periodic oscillation (LFQPO) superposed onto a band limited noise continuum and accompanied by at least one harmonic. In this paper we focus on three plateaux, presenting the analysis of the power density spectra and in particular of the LFQPO and its harmonics. While plotting the LFQPO and all the harmonics together on a frequency-width plane, we found the presence of a positive trend of broadening when the frequency increases. This trend can shed light in the nature of the harmonic content of the LFQPO and challenges the usual interpretation of these timing features.",12,[],1
1207.6223,astro-ph,"We review the evidence behind recent claims of spatial variation in the fine structure constant deriving from observations of ionic absorption lines in the light from distant quasars. To this end we expand upon previous non-Bayesian analyses limited by the assumptions of an unbiased and strictly Normal distribution for the ""unexplained errors"" of the benchmark quasar dataset. Through the technique of reverse logistic regression we estimate and compare marginal likelihoods for three competing hypotheses---(i) the null hypothesis (no cosmic variation), (ii) the monopole hypothesis (a constant Earth-to-quasar offset), and (iii) the monopoledipole hypothesis (a cosmic variation manifest to the Earth-bound observer as a North-South divergence)---under a variety of candidate parametric forms for the unexplained error term. Our analysis reveals weak support for a skeptical interpretation in which the apparent dipole effect is driven solely by systematic errors of opposing sign inherent in measurements from the two telescopes employed to obtain these observations. Throughout we seek to exemplify a 'best practice' approach to Bayesian model selection with prior-sensitivity analysis; in a companion paper we extend this methodology to a semi-parametric framework using the infinite-dimensional Dirichlet process.",12,[],1
1202.4461,astro-ph,"The evolutionary properties of the old metal-rich Galactic open cluster NGC6791 are assessed, based on deep UB photometry and 2Mass JK data. For 4739 stars in the cluster, bolometric luminosity and effective temperature have been derived from theoretical (U-B) and (J-K) color fitting. The derived H-R diagram has been matched with the UVBLUE grid of synthetic stellar spectra to obtain the integrated SED of the system, together with a full set UV (Fanelli) and optical (Lick) narrow-band indices. The cluster appears to be a fairly good proxy of standard elliptical galaxies, although with significantly bluer infrared colors, a shallower 4000A Balmer break, and a lower Mg2 index. The confirmed presence of a dozen hot stars, along their EHB evolution, leads the cluster SED to consistently match the properties of the most active UV-upturn galaxies, with 1.7/-0.4% of the total bolometric luminosity emitted shortward of 2500A.   The cluster Helium abundance results Y=0.30 /-0.04, while the Post-MS implied stellar lifetime from star number counts fairly agrees with the theoretical expectations from both the Padova and BASTI stellar tracks. A Post-MS fuel consumption of 0.43 /- 0.01 Msun is found for NGC6791 stars, in close agreement with the estimated mass of cluster He-rich white dwarfs. Such a tight figure may lead to suspect that a fraction of the cluster stellar population does actually not reach the minimum mass required to effectively ignite He in the stellar core.",12,[],1
1210.3067,astro-ph,"While clusters of galaxies are considered one of the most important cosmological probes, the standard spherical modelling of the dark matter and the intracluster medium is only a rough approximation. Indeed, it is well established both theoretically and observationally that galaxy clusters are much better approximated as triaxial objects. However, investigating the asphericity of galaxy clusters is still in its infancy. We review here this topic which is currently gathering a growing interest from the cluster community. We begin by introducing the triaxial geometry. Then we discuss the topic of deprojection and demonstrate the need for combining different probes of the cluster's potential. We discuss the different works that have been addressing these issues. We present a general parametric framework intended to simultaneously fit complementary data sets (X-ray, Sunyaev Zel'dovich and lensing data). We discuss in details the case of Abell 1689 to show how different models/data sets lead to different haloe parameters. We present the results obtained from fitting a 3D NFW model to X-ray, SZ, and lensing data for 4 strong lensing clusters. We argue that a triaxial model generally allows to lower the inferred value of the concentration parameter compared to a spherical analysis. This may alleviate tensions regarding, e.g. the over-concentration problem. However, we stress that predictions from numerical simulations rely on a spherical analysis of triaxial halos. Given that triaxial analysis will have a growing importance in the observational side, we advocate the need for simulations to be analysed in the very same way, allowing reliable and meaningful comparisons. Besides, methods intended to derive the three dimensional shape of galaxy clusters should be extensively tested on simulated multi-wavelength observations.",12,[],1
1203.4787,astro-ph,"We have carried out an analysis of the HST STIS archival spectra of the magnetic white dwarf in the Hyades eclipsing-spectroscopic, post-common envelope binary V471 Tauri, time resolved on the orbit and on the X-ray rotational phase of the magnetic white dwarf. An HST STIS spectrum obtained during primary eclipse reveals a host of transition region/chromospheric emission features including N V (1238, 1242), Si IV (1393, 1402), C IV (1548, 1550) and He II (1640). The spectroscopic characteristics and emission line fluxes of the transition region/chromosphere of the very active, rapidly rotating, K2V component of V471 Tauri, are compared with the emission characteristics of fast rotating K dwarfs in young open clusters. We have detected a number of absorption features associated with metals accreted onto the photosphere of the magnetic white dwarf from which we derive radial velocities. All of the absorption features are modulated on the 555s rotation period of the white dwarf with maximum line strength at rotational phase 0.0 when the primary magnetic accretion region is facing the observer. The photospheric absorption features show no clear evidence of Zeeman splitting and no evidence of a correlation between their variations in strength and orbital phase. We report clear evidence of a secondary accretion pole. We derive C and Si abundances from the Si IV and C III features. All other absorption lines are either interstellar or associated with a region above the white dwarf and/or with coronal mass ejection events illuminated as they pass in front of the white dwarf.",12,[],1
1206.4585,astro-ph,"Steady accretion of a radiating gas onto a central mass point is described and compared to classic Bondi accretion. Radiation losses are essential for accretion flows to be observed. Unlike Bondi flows, radiating Bondi flows pass through a sonic point at a finite radius and become supersonic near the center. The morphology of all radiating Bondi flows is described by a single dimensionless parameter. In radiating Bondi flows the mass accretion rate varies approximately as the first power of the central mass -- this differs significantly from the quadratic dependence on the central mass in classical Bondi flows. Mass accretion rates onto galaxy or cluster-centered black holes estimated from traditional and radiating Bondi flows are significantly different. In radiating Bondi flows the gas temperature increases at large radii, as in the cores of many galaxy groups and clusters, allowing radiating Bondi flows to merge naturally with gas arriving from their cluster environments. Some radiating flows cool completely before reaching the center of the flow, and this also occurs in cooling site flows in which there is no central gravitating mass.",12,[],1
1211.7266,astro-ph,"Among dozens young pulsar wind nebulae, some have been detected in TeV letter-rays (TeV PWNe), while others have not (non-TeV PWNe). The TeV emission detectability is not correlated either with the spin-down power or with the characteristic age of their central pulsars, and it is an open problem what determines the detectability. To study this problem, we investigate spectral evolution of five young non-TeV PWNe, 3C58, G310.6-1.6, G292.01.8, G11.2-0.3 and SNR B0540-69.3. We use a spectral evolution model which has been developed to be applied to young TeV PWNe in our previous works. TeV letter-ray flux upper limits of non-TeV PWNe give upper or lower limits on parameters, such as the age of the PWN and the fraction of the spin-down power going to the magnetic energy injection (the fraction parameter). Combined with other independent observational and theoretical studies, we can guess a plausible value of the parameters for each object. For 3C58, we prefer the parameters with an age of 2.5 kyr old and the fraction parameter of 3.0x10-3, although the spectral modeling alone does not rule out a shorter age and a higher fraction parameter. The fraction parameter of 3.0x10-3 is also consistent for other non-TeV PWNe and then the value is regarded as common to young PWNe including TeV PWNe. Moreover, we find that the intrinsic properties of the central pulsars are similar, 1048-50erg for the initial rotational energy and 1042-44erg for the magnetic energy (2x1012 - 3x1013G for the dipole magnetic field strength at their surfaces). The TeV detectability is correlated with the total injected energy and the energy density of the interstellar radiation field around PWNe. Except for G292.01.8, a broken power-law injection of the particles well reproduces the broadband emission from non-TeV PWNe.",12,[],1
1207.2160,astro-ph,"We provide new constraints on the connection between galaxies in the local universe, identified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and dark matter halos and their constituent substructures in the equationCDM model using WMAP7 cosmological parameters. Predictions for the abundance and clustering properties of dark matter halos, and the relationship between dark matter hosts and substructures, are based on a high-resolution cosmological simulation, the Bolshoi simulation. We associate galaxies with halos and subhalos using subhalo abundance matching, performing a comprehensive analysis which investigates the underlying assumptions of this technique including (a) which halo property is most closely associated with galaxy stellar masses and luminosities, (b) how much scatter is in this relationship, and (c) how much subhalos can be stripped before their galaxies are destroyed. The models are jointly constrained by new measurements of the projected two-point galaxy clustering and the observed conditional stellar mass function of galaxies in groups. The data put tight constraints on the satellite fraction of galaxies as a function of galaxy stellar mass, on the scatter between halo and galaxy properties, and on the underlying conditional stellar mass function. These data rule out several halo properties commonly used in abundance matching, largely because the satellite fractions in the models disagree with those data. We show that an abundance matching model that associates galaxies with the peak circular velocity of their halos is in good agreement with the data, when scatter of equation dex in stellar mass at a given peak velocity is included. This will yield important constraints for galaxy formation models, and also provides encouraging indications that the galaxy--halo connection can be modeled with sufficient fidelity for future precision studies of the dark Universe.",12,[],1
1209.5580,astro-ph,"Observational growth rate data had been derived from observations of redshift distortions in galaxy redshift surveys. Here we use the growth rate data to place constraints on the dark energy model parameters. By performing a joint analysis with the Type Ia supernova, baryon acoustic oscillation and cosmic microwave background data, it is found that the growth rate data are useful for improving the constraints. The joint constraints show that the equationCDM model is still in good agreement with current observations, although a time-variant dark energy still cannot be ruled out. It is argued that the growth rate data are helpful for understanding the dark energy. With more accurate data available in the future, we will have a powerful tool for constraining the cosmological and dark energy parameters.",12,[],1
1211.2232,astro-ph,"We develop and demonstrate an acceleration of the Liu & Tegmark quadratic estimator formalism for inverse variance foreground subtraction and power spectrum estimation in 21 cm tomography from O(N3) to O(N log N), where N is the number of voxels of data. This technique makes feasible the megavoxel scale analysis necessary for current and upcoming radio interferometers by making only moderately restrictive assumptions about foreground models and survey geometry. We exploit iterative and Monte Carlo techniques and the symmetries of the foreground covariance matrices to quickly estimate the 21 cm brightness temperature power spectrum, P(kparallel, kperpendicular), the Fisher information matrix, the error bars, the window functions, and the bias. We also extend the Liu & Tegmark foreground model to include bright point sources with known positions in a way that scales as O[(N log N)(N point sources)] < O(N5/3). As a first application of our method, we forecast error bars and window functions for the upcoming 128-tile deployment of the Murchinson Widefield Array, showing that 1000 hours of observation should prove sufficiently sensitive to detect the power spectrum signal from the Epoch of Reionization.",12,[],1
1210.4476,astro-ph,"We present results from a study of the globular cluster (GC) systems of four spiral and S0 galaxies imaged as part of an ongoing wide-field survey of the GC systems of giant galaxies. The target galaxies -- the SB0 galaxy NGC1023, the SBb galaxy NGC1055, and an isolated pair comprised of the Sbc galaxy NGC7339 and the S0 galaxy NGC7332 -- were observed in BVR filters with the WIYN 3.5-m telescope and Minimosaic camera. For two of the galaxies, we combined the WIYN imaging with previously-published data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Keck Observatory to help characterize the GC distribution in the central few kiloparsecs. We determine the radial distribution (surface density of GCs versus projected radius) of each galaxy's GC system and use it to calculate the total number of GCs (NGC). We find NGC = 490/-30, 210/-40, 175/-15, and 75/-10 for NGC1023, NGC1055, NGC7332, and NGC7339, respectively. We also calculate the GC specific frequency (NGC normalized by host galaxy luminosity or mass) and find values typical of those of the other spiral and E/S0 galaxies in the survey. The two lenticular galaxies have sufficient numbers of GC candidates for us to perform statistical tests for bimodality in the GC color distributions. We find evidence at a high confidence level (>95%) for two populations in the B-R distribution of the GC system of NGC1023. We find weaker evidence for bimodality (>81% confidence) in the GC color distribution of NGC7332. Finally, we identify eight GC candidates that may be associated with the Magellanic dwarf galaxy NGC1023A, a satellite of NGC1023.",12,[],1

1209.2623,astro-ph,"Radial velocity measurements can be used to constrain the dynamical state of a stellar cluster. However, for clusters with velocity dispersions smaller than a few km/s the observed radial velocity distribution tends to be dominated by the orbital motions of binaries rather than the stellar motions through the potential well of the cluster. Our goal is to characterize the intrinsic velocity distribution of a cluster from a single epoch of radial velocity data, even for a cluster with a velocity dispersion of a fraction of a km/s, using a maximum likelihood procedure. Assuming a period, mass ratio, and eccentricity distribution for the binaries in the observed cluster this procedure fits a dynamical model describing the velocity distribution for the single stars and center of masses of the binaries, simultaneously with the radial velocities caused by binary orbital motions, using all the information available in the observed velocity distribution. We find that the fits to the intrinsic velocity distribution depend only weakly on the binary properties assumed, so the uncertainty in the fitted parameters tends to be dominated by statistical uncertainties. Based on Monte Carlo simulations we provide an estimate of how these statistical uncertainties vary with the velocity dispersion, binary fraction, and the number of observed stars, which can be used to estimate the sample size needed to reach a specific accuracy. Finally we test the method on the well-studied open cluster NGC 188, showing that it can reproduce a velocity dispersion of only 0.5 km/s using a single epoch of the multi-epoch radial velocity data. If the binary period, mass ratio, and eccentricity distribution of the observed stars are roughly known, this procedure can be used to correct for the effect of binary orbital motions on an observed velocity distribution.

1203.5514,astro-ph,"Photospheric magnetic fields were studied using the Kitt Peak synoptic maps for 1976-2003. Only strong magnetic fields (B>100 G) of the equatorial region were taken into account. The north-south asymmetry of the magnetic fluxes was considered as well as the imbalance between positive and negative fluxes. The north-south asymmetry displays a regular alternation of the dominant hemisphere during the solar cycle: the northern hemisphere dominated in the ascending phase, the southern one in the descending phase during Solar Cycles 21-23. The sign of the imbalance did not change during the 11 years from one polar-field reversal to the next and always coincided with the sign of the Sun's polar magnetic field in the northern hemisphere. The dominant sign of leading sunspots in one of the hemispheres determines the sign of the magnetic-flux imbalance. The sign of the north-south asymmetry of the magnetic fluxes and the sign of the imbalance of the positive and the negative fluxes are related to the quarter of the 22-year magnetic cycle where the magnetic configuration of the Sun remains constant (from the minimum where the sunspot sign changes according to Hale's law to the magnetic-field reversal and from the reversal to the minimum). The sign of the north-south asymmetry for the time interval considered was determined by the phase of the 11-year cycle (before or after the reversal); the sign of the imbalance of the positive and the negative fluxes depends on both the phase of the 11-year cycle and on the parity of the solar cycle. The results obtained demonstrate the connection of the magnetic fields in active regions with the Sun's polar magnetic field in the northern hemisphere.",12,[],1
1201.2896,astro-ph,"Modern X-ray observatories yield unique insight into the astrophysical time domain. Each X-ray photon can be assigned an arrival time, an energy and a sky position, yielding sensitive, energy-dependent light curves and enabling time-resolved spectra down to millisecond time-scales. Combining those with multiple views of the same patch of sky (e.g., in the Chandra and XMM-Newton deep fields) so as to extend variability studies over longer baselines, the spectral timing capacity of X-ray observatories then stretch over 10 orders of magnitude at spatial resolutions of arcseconds, and 13 orders of magnitude at spatial resolutions of a degree. A wealth of high-energy time-domain data already exists, and indicates variability on timescales ranging from microseconds to years in a wide variety of objects, including numerous classes of AGN, high-energy phenomena at the Galactic centre, Galactic and extra-Galactic X-ray binaries, supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, stellar flares, tidal disruption flares, and as-yet unknown X-ray variables. This workshop explored the potential of strategic X-ray surveys to probe a broad range of astrophysical sources and phenomena.

1205.1612,astro-ph,"Relativistic jets propagating through an ambient medium must produce some observational effects along their side boundaries because of interactions across the large velocity gradient. One possible effect of such an interaction would be a sheared magnetic field structure at the jet boundaries, leading to a characteristic radio polarization pattern. As proposed by Ostrowski, another effect can come from the generation of a high energy cosmic ray component at the boundary, producing dynamic effects on the medium surrounding the jet and forming a cocoon dominated by cosmic rays with a decreased thermal gas emissivity. We selected this process for our first attempt to look for the effects of this type of interaction. We analyzed the Chandra X-ray data for the radio galaxy M87 in order to verify if the expected regions of diminished emissivity may be present near the spectacular X-ray jet in this source. The detailed analysis of the data, merged from 42 separate observations, shows signatures of lower emissivity surrounding the jet. In particular we detect an intensity dip along the part of the jet, which would be approximately 150 pc x 2 kpc in size, if situated along the jet which is inclined toward us. Due to a highly non-uniform X-ray background in the central region we are not able to claim the discovery of a cosmic ray cocoon around the M87 jet: we only have demonstrated that the data show morphological structures which could be accounted for if a cosmic ray cocoon exists.",12,[],1
1203.5528,astro-ph,"The winds from a non-accreting pulsar and a massive star in a binary system collide forming a bow-shaped shock structure. The Coriolis force induced by orbital motion deflects the shocked flows, strongly affecting their dynamics. We study the evolution of the shocked stellar and pulsar winds on scales in which the orbital motion is important. Potential sites of non-thermal activity are investigated. Relativistic hydrodynamical simulations in two dimensions, performed with the code PLUTO and using the adaptive mesh refinement technique, are used to model interacting stellar and pulsar winds on scales ~80 times the distance between the stars. The hydrodynamical results suggest the suitable locations of sites for particle acceleration and non-thermal emission. In addition to the shock formed towards the star, the shocked and unshocked components of the pulsar wind flowing away from the star terminate by means of additional strong shocks produced by the orbital motion. Strong instabilities lead to the development of turbulence and an effective two-wind mixing in both the leading and trailing sides of the interaction structure, which starts to merge with itself after one orbit. The adopted moderate pulsar-wind Lorentz factor already provides a good qualitative description of the phenomena involved in high-mass binaries with pulsars, and can capture important physical effects that would not appear in non-relativistic treatments. Simulations show that shocks, instabilities, and mass-loading yield efficient mass, momentum, and energy exchanges between the pulsar and the stellar winds. This renders a rapid increase in the entropy of the shocked structure, which will likely be disrupted on scales beyond the simulated ones. Several sites of particle acceleration and low- and high-energy emission can be identified. Doppler boosting will have significant and complex effects on radiation.",12,[],1
1201.4052,astro-ph,"One of the methods for studying the highest energy cosmic rays is to measure the fluorescence light emitted by the extensive air showers induced by them. To reconstruct a shower cascade curve from measurements of the number of photons arriving from the subsequent shower track elements it is necessary to take into account the multiple scatterings that photons undergo on their way from the shower to the detector. In contrast to the earlier Monte-Carlo work, we present here an analytical method to treat the Rayleigh and Mie scatterings in the atmosphere. The method consists in considering separately the consecutive 'generations' of the scattered light. Starting with a point light source in a uniform medium, we then examine a source in a real atmosphere and finally - a moving source (shower) in it. We calculate the angular distributions of the scattered light superimposed on the not scattered light registered from a shower at a given time. The analytical solutions (although approximate) show how the exact numerical results should be parametrised what we do for the first two generations (the contribution of the higher ones being small). Not allowing for the considered effect may lead to an overestimation of shower primary energy by ~15% and to an underestimation of the primary particle mass.",12,[],1
1201.2789,astro-ph,"We present twenty-three transit light curves and seven occultation light curves for the ultra-short period planet WASP-43 b, in addition to eight new measurements of the radial velocity of the star. Thanks to this extensive data set, we improve significantly the parameters of the system. Notably, the largely improved precision on the stellar density (2.41-0.08 rhosun) combined with constraining the age to be younger than a Hubble time allows us to break the degeneracy of the stellar solution mentioned in the discovery paper. The resulting stellar mass and size are 0.717-0.025 Msun and 0.667-0.011 Rsun. Our deduced physical parameters for the planet are 2.034-0.052 Mjup and 1.036-0.019 Rjup. Taking into account its level of irradiation, the high density of the planet favors an old age and a massive core. Our deduced orbital eccentricity, 0.0035(-0.0025,0.0060), is consistent with a fully circularized orbit. We detect the emission of the planet at 2.09 microns at better than 11-sigma, the deduced occultation depth being 1560-140 ppm. Our detection of the occultation at 1.19 microns is marginal (790-320 ppm) and more observations are needed to confirm it. We place a 3-sigma upper limit of 850 ppm on the depth of the occultation at ~0.9 microns. Together, these results strongly favor a poor redistribution of the heat to the night-side of the planet, and marginally favor a model with no day-side temperature inversion.",12,[],1
1211.1395,astro-ph,"Feedback from supernovae is an essential aspect of galaxy formation. In order to improve subgrid models of feedback we perform a series of numerical experiments to investigate how supernova explosions power galactic winds. We use the Flash hydrodynamic code to model a simplified ISM, including gravity, hydrodynamics, radiative cooling above 10,000 K, and star formation that reproduces the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. By simulating a small patch of the ISM in a tall box perpendicular to the disk, we obtain sub-parsec resolution allowing us to resolve individual supernova events and we investigate how the wind properties depend on those of the ISM and the galaxy. We find that outflows are more efficient in disks with lower surface densities or gas fractions. A simple model in which the warm cloudy medium is the barrier that limits the expansion of blast waves reproduces the scaling of outflow properties with disk parameters at high star formation rates. The scaling we find sets the investigation of galaxy winds on a new footing, providing a physically motivated sub-grid description of winds that can be implemented in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and phenomenological models.

1206.4875,astro-ph,"In the last years several exoplanets have been discovered that orbit one component of a compact binary system (separation < 50 astronomical units), the probably best-known case is gamma-Cephei. So far, all attempts to explain the in-situ formation of these planets has been unsuccessful, in part because of the strong gravitational perturbations of the secondary star on any initial planetesimal swarm. Here we test whether planetary bodies in compact binaries, in particular gamma-Cephei, could have originated from a close encounter with a passing star, assuming initial configurations for the stellar system suitable for planetary formation. In other words, we analyze whether the orbital configuration of the current binary system might have been generated after the formation of the planet, and as a consequence of a close encounter with a third star in hyperbolic orbit. We performed a series of time-reverse N-body simulations of stellar scattering events in which the present-day configuration of gamma-Cephei was used as the initial condition plus a hypothetical third star as an impactor. We analyzed which configurations and system parameters could have given birth to the current system. Depending on the maximum impact velocity allowed for accretional collisions, we find that between 1% and 5% of stellar encounters correspond to an ""original"" system in which planetary formation around the primary star is not inhibited by the secondary, but is acceptable within the classical core-accretion scenario. Thus, although not highly probable, it is plausible that stellar encounters may have played a significant role in shaping these types of exoplanetary systems.",12,[],1
1207.0969,astro-ph,"The Chromosphere and Prominence Magnetometer (ChroMag) is conceived with the goal of quantifying the intertwined dynamics and magnetism of the solar chromosphere and in prominences through imaging spectro-polarimetry of the full solar disk. The picture of chromospheric magnetism and dynamics is rapidly developing, and a pressing need exists for breakthrough observations of chromospheric vector magnetic field measurements at the true lower boundary of the heliospheric system. ChroMag will provide measurements that will enable scientists to study and better understand the energetics of the solar atmosphere, how prominences are formed, how energy is stored in the magnetic field structure of the atmosphere and how it is released during space weather events like flares and coronal mass ejections. An integral part of the ChroMag program is a commitment to develop and provide community access to the ""inversion"" tools necessary for the difficult interpretation of the measurements and derive the magneto-hydrodynamic parameters of the plasma.

1201.5149,astro-ph,"We present a spectroscopic survey of 21 young massive clusters and complexes and one tidal dwarf galaxy candidate (TDG) in Stephan's Quintet, an interacting compact group of galaxies. All of the selected targets lie outside the main galaxies of the system and are associated with tidal debris. We find clusters with ages between a few and 125 Myr and confirm the ages estimated through HST photometry by Fedotov et al. (2011), as well as their modelled interaction history of the Quintet. Many of the clusters are found to be relatively long-lived, given their spectrosopically derived ages, while their high masses suggest that they will likely evolve to eventually become intergalactic clusters. One cluster, T118, is particularly interesting, given its age (\sim 125 Myr), high mass (\sim 2\times106 M\odot) and position in the extreme outer end of the young tidal tail. This cluster appears to be quite extended (Reff \sim 12 - 15 pc) compared to clusters observed in galaxy disks (Reff \sim 3 - 4 pc), which confirms an effect we previously found in the tidal tails of NGC 3256, where clusters are similarly extended. We find that star and cluster formation can proceed at a continuous pace for at least \sim 150 Myr within the tidal debris of interacting galaxies. The spectrum of the TDG candidate is dominated by a young population (\sim 7 Myr), and assuming a single age for the entire region, has a mass of at least 106 M\odot.",12,[],1
1203.5049,astro-ph,"Weak gravitational lensing has the potential to constrain cosmological parameters to high precision. However, as shown by the Shear TEsting Programmes (STEP) and GRavitational lEnsing Accuracy Testing (GREAT) Challenges, measuring galaxy shears is a nontrivial task: various methods introduce different systematic biases which have to be accounted for. We investigate how pixel noise on the image affects the bias on shear estimates from a Maximum-Likelihood forward model-fitting approach using a sum of co-elliptical S\'ersic profiles, in complement to the theoretical approach of an an associated paper. We evaluate the bias using a simple but realistic galaxy model and find that the effects of noise alone can cause biases of order 1-10% on measured shears, which is significant for current and future lensing surveys. We evaluate a simulation-based calibration method to create a bias model as a function of galaxy properties and observing conditions. This model is then used to correct the simulated measurements. We demonstrate that this method can effectively reduce noise bias so that shear measurement reaches the level of accuracy required for estimating cosmic shear in upcoming lensing surveys.",12,[],1
1207.1560,astro-ph,"Gamma-ray catalogs contain a considerable amount of unidentified sources. Many of these are located out of the Galactic plane and therefore may have extragalactic origin. Here we assume that the formation of massive black holes in galactic nuclei proceeds through a quasi-star stage and consider the possibility of jet production by such objects. Those jets would be the sources of collimated synchrotron and Compton emission, extending from radio to gamma rays. The expected lifetimes of quasi-stars are of the order of million of years while the jet luminosities, somewhat smaller than that of quasar jets, are sufficient to account for the unidentified gamma-ray sources. The jet emission dominates over the thermal emission of a quasi-star in all energy bands, except when the jet is not directed towards an observer. The predicted synchrotron emission peaks in the IR band, with the flux close to the limits of the available IR all sky surveys. The ratio of the equation-ray flux to the IR flux is found to be very large (equation), much larger than in BL Lac objects but reached by some radio-loud quasars. On the other hand, radio-loud quasars show broad emission lines while no such lines are expected from quasi-stars. Therefore the differentiation between various scenarios accounting for the unidentified gamma-ray sources will be possible at the basis of the photometry and spectroscopy of the IR/optical counterparts.",12,[],1
1212.6910,astro-ph,"Magnetic field observations of low-mass stars reveal an increase of magnetic activity with increasing rotation rate. The so-called activity-rotation relation is usually attributed to changes in the underlying dynamo processes generating the magnetic field. We examine the dependence of the field strength on rotation in global numerical dynamo models and interpret our results on the basis of energy considerations. In agreement with the scaling law proposed by Christensen & Aubert (2006), the field strength in our simulations is set by the fraction of the available power used for the magnetic field generation. This is controlled by the dynamo efficiency calculated as the ratio of Ohmic to total dissipation in our models. The dynamo efficiency grows strongly with increasing rotation rate at a Rossby number of 0.1 until it reaches its upper bound of one and becomes independent of rotation. This gain in efficiency is related to the strong rotational dependence of the mean electromotive force in this parameter regime. For multipolar models at Rossby numbers clearly larger than 0.1, on the other hand, we do not find a systematic dependence of the field strength on rotation. Whether the enhancement of the dynamo efficiency found in our dipolar models explains the observed activity-rotation relation needs to be further assessed.",12,[],1

However, the ion (HCO) and neutral (HCN) species used in such studies may not be necessarily co-evolving at every scale and density and may thus not trace the same regions. Here, we use coupled chemical/dynamical models of evolving prestellar molecular cloud cores including non-equilibrium chemistry, with and without magnetic fields, to study the spatial distribution of HCO and HCN, which have been used in observations of spectral linewidth differences to date. In addition, we seek new ion-neutral pairs that are good candidates for such observations because they have similar evolution and are approximately co-spatial in our models. We identify three such good candidate pairs: HCO/NO, HCO/CO, and NO/NO.",12,[],1
1206.4905,astro-ph,"Many chemical models of dense interstellar clouds predict that the majority of gas-phase elemental nitrogen should be present as N2, with an abundance approximately five orders of magnitude less than that of hydrogen. As a homonuclear diatomic molecule, N2 is difficult to detect spectroscopically through infrared or millimetre-wavelength transitions so its abundance is often inferred indirectly through its reaction product N2H. Two main formation mechanisms each involving two radical-radical reactions are the source of N2 in such environments. Here we report measurements of the low temperature rate constants for one of these processes, the N  CN reaction down to 56 K. The effect of the measured rate constants for this reaction and those recently determined for two other reactions implicated in N2 formation are tested using a gas-grain model employing a critically evaluated chemical network. We show that the amount of interstellar nitrogen present as N2 depends on the competition between its gas-phase formation and the depletion of atomic nitrogen onto grains. As the reactions controlling N2 formation are inefficient, we argue that N2 does not represent the main reservoir species for interstellar nitrogen. Instead, elevated abundances of more labile forms of nitrogen such as NH3 should be present on interstellar ices, promoting the eventual formation of nitrogen-bearing organic molecules.",12,[],1
1202.4964,astro-ph,"TYC 4110-01037-1 has a low-mass stellar companion, whose small mass ratio and short orbital period are atypical amongst solar-like (Teff ~< 6000 K) binary systems. Our analysis of TYC 4110-01037-1 reveals it to be a moderately aged (~<5 Gyr) solar-like star having a mass of 1.07 /- 0.08 MSun and radius of 0.99 /- 0.18 RSun. We analyze 32 radial velocity measurements from the SDSS-III MARVELS survey as well as 6 supporting radial velocity measurements from the SARG spectrograph on the 3.6m TNG telescope obtained over a period of ~2 years. The best Keplerian orbital fit parameters were found to have a period of 78.994 /- 0.012 days, an eccentricity of 0.1095 /- 0.0023, and a semi-amplitude of 4199 /- 11 m/s. We determine the minimum companion mass (if sin i = 1) to be 97.7 /- 5.8 MJup. The system's companion to host star mass ratio, >0.087 /- 0.003, places it at the lowest end of observed values for short period stellar companions to solar-like (Teff ~< 6000 K) stars. One possible way to create such a system would be if a triple-component stellar multiple broke up into a short period, low q binary during the cluster dispersal phase of its lifetime. A candidate tertiary body has been identified in the system via single-epoch, high contrast imagery. If this object is confirmed to be co-moving, we estimate it would be a dM4 star.

1205.5033,astro-ph,"(Abridged) We combine published photometry for the nuclear star clusters (NSCs) and stellar spheroids of 51 low-mass, early-type galaxies in the Virgo cluster with empirical mass-to-light ratios, in order to complement previous studies that explore the dependence of NSC masses (MNSC) on various properties of their host galaxies. We confirm a roughly linear relationship between MNSC and luminous host spheroid mass (MSph), albeit with considerable scatter (0.57 dex). We estimate velocity dispersions from the virial theorem, assuming all galaxies in our sample share a common DM fraction and are dynamically relaxed. We then find that MNSC \sim letter2.73 0.29, with a slightly reduced scatter of 0.54 dex.   This confirms recent results that the shape of the MCMO - letter relation is different for NSCs and super-massive black holes (SMBHs). We discuss this result in the context of the generalized idea of ""central massive objects"" (CMOs).   In order to assess which physical parameters drive the observed NSC masses, we also carry out a joint multi-variate power-law fit to the data. In this, we allow MNSC to depend on MSph and RSph (and hence implicitly on letter), as well as on the size of the globular cluster reservoir. When considered together, the dependences on MSph and RSph are roughly consistent with the virial theorem, and hence MNSC \propto letter2. However, the only statistically significant correlation is a linear scaling between MNSC and MSph.   We compare MNSC with predictions for two popular models for NSC formation, namely i) globular cluster infall due to dynamical friction, and ii) in-situ formation during the early phases of galaxy formation that is regulated via momentum feedback from stellar winds and/or supernovae. Neither model can directly predict the observations, and we discuss possible interpretations of our findings.",12,[],1
1209.0265,astro-ph,"We present near-infrared (2.5-5.0 letterm) spectral studies of shocked H2 gas in the two supernova remnants IC 443 and HB 21, which are well known for their interactions with nearby molecular clouds. The observations were performed with Infrared Camera (IRC) aboard the AKARI satellite. At the energy range 7000 K <= E(v,J) <= 20000 K, the shocked H2 gas in IC 443 shows an ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) of 2.40.3-0.2, which is significantly lower than the equilibrium value 3, suggesting the existence of non-equilibrium OPR. The shocked gas in HB 21 also indicates a potential non-equilibrium OPR in the range of 1.8-2.0. The level populations are well described by the power-law thermal admixture model with a single OPR, where the temperature integration range is 1000-4000 K. We conclude that the obtained non-equilibrium OPR probably originates from the reformed H2 gas of dissociative J-shocks, considering several factors such as the shock combination requirement, the line ratios, and the possibility that H2 gas can form on grains with a non-equilibrium OPR. We also investigate C-shocks and partially-dissociative J-shocks for the origin of the non-equilibrium OPR. However, we find that they are incompatible with the observed ionic emission lines for which dissociative J-shocks are required to explain. The difference in the collision energy of H atoms on grain surfaces would make the observed difference between the OPRs of IC 443 and HB 21, if dissociative J-shocks are responsible for the H2 emission. Our study suggests that dissociative J-shocks can make shocked H2 gas with a non-equilibrium OPR.",12,[],1
1204.1578,astro-ph,"We have examined the ratio between the integrated luminosity of massive young stellar objects detected by the Red MSX Source (RMS) survey and the mass of molecular clouds in the Galactic Ring Survey region, as a function of Galactocentric radius. The results indicate that 60--80% of the observed increases in the star-formation rate density associated with spiral-arm features are due to source crowding within the arms. Of the remainder, most of the increase in the inner Sagittarius arm is due to an enhancement in the simple star-formation efficiency, i.e. in the number of RMS sources per unit molecular gas mass. In the inner Perseus arm, the residual increase is due to a higher than average mean source luminosity, which implies a top-heavy IMF, and this is entirely due to the presence, in the GRS region, of the W49 star-forming complex, which appears to be exceptional in its nature. The results also suggest that there is little or no increase in the star-formation efficiency on kiloparsec scales in the Scutum tangent region which includes W43. We discuss the possible role played by the spiral arms in influencing the star-formation efficiency and conclude that the most likely mechanisms are related to orbit crowding within the arms.",12,[],1
1207.5805,astro-ph,"We report our multiwavelength study of the 2011 outburst evolution of the newly discovered black hole candidate X-ray binary Swift J1357.2-0933. We analysed the Swift X-ray telescope and Ultraviolet/Optical telescope (UVOT) data taken during the ~7 months duration of the outburst. It displayed a 2-10 keV X-ray peak luminosity of ~1E35(D/1.5 kpc)2 erg s-1 which classifies the source as a very faint X-ray transient. We found that the X-ray spectrum at the peak was consistent with the source being in the hard state, but it softened with decreasing luminosity, a common behaviour of black holes at low luminosities or returning to quiescence from the hard state. The correlations between the simultaneous X-ray and ultraviolet/optical data suggest a system with a black hole accreting from a viscous disc that is not irradiated. The UVOT filters provide the opportunity to study these correlations up to ultraviolet wavelengths a regime so far unexplored.

1207.4536,astro-ph,"We report on a pilot study on identifying metal-poor stars pre-enriched by Pair-Instability Supernovae (PISNe). Very massive, first generation (Population III) stars (140M\odot \leq M \leq 260M\odot) end their lives as PISNe, which have been predicted by theories, but no relics of PISNe have been observed yet. Among the distinct characteristics of the yields of PISN, as predicted by theoretical calculations, are a strong odd-even effect, and a strong overabundance of Ca with respect to iron and the Solar ratio. We use the latter characteristic to identify metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo that have been pre-enriched by PISN, by comparing metallicites derived from strong, co-added Fe lines detected in low-resolution (i.e., R \sim 2000) spectra of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), with metallicities determined by the SDSS Stellar Parameters Pipeline (SSPP). The latter are based on the strength of the Ca II K line and assumptions on the Ca/Fe abundance ratio. Stars are selected as candidates if their metallicity derived from Fe lines is significantly lower than the SSPP metallicities. In a sample of 12,300 stars for which SDSS spectroscopy is available, we have identified 18 candidate stars. Higher resolution and signal-to-noise ratio spectra of these candidates are being obtained with the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory and the XSHOOTER spectrograph, to determine their abundance patterns, and to verify our selection method.

However, the 1.1 mm observations resolved the individual disks of GV Tau N and GV Tau S and allowed us to study their chemistry. We detected the HCN 3->2 line only towards the individual disk of GV Tau N, and the emission of the HCO 3->2 line towards GV Tau S. Simple calculations indicate that the 3->2 line of HCN is formed in the inner R<12 AU of the disk around GV Tau N where the HCN/HCO abundance ratio is >300. On the contrary, this ratio is <1.6 in the disk around GV Tau S.

1212.2190,astro-ph,"The contribution of the quiet Sun to solar irradiance variability, due either to changes of the solar effective temperature or to the presence of unresolved magnetic field, is still poorly understood. In this study we investigate spectral line diagnostics that are sensitive to both temperature variations and the presence of small scale unresolved magnetic features in these areas of the solar atmosphere. Specifically we study the dependence on the magnetic flux density of three parameters describing the shape of two magnetically sensitive FeI lines, at 630.2 nm and 617.3 nm, namely the line core intensity (IC), full width at half maximum (FWHM), and the equivalent width (EQW). To this aim we analyze observations of active region NOAA 11172, acquired with IBIS at the Dunn Solar Telescope, as well as results from numerical synthesis. Our results show that IC is sensitive to both temperature and magnetic flux density variations, FWHM is mostly affected by magnetic field changes, and EQW is mostly sensitive to temperature. Variations of a few percent of the measured line parameters are found in observational data that was spatially degraded to represent quiet-Sun, disk-centre, medium resolution observations. It is therefore possible to disentangle magnetic from pure thermodynamic effects by comparison of temporal variations of the EQW and the FWHM of either the two FeI lines.",12,[],1
1208.4667,astro-ph,"As telescopes get larger, the size of a seeing-limited spectrograph for a given resolving power becomes larger also, and for ELTs the size will be so great that high resolution instruments of simple design will be infeasible. Solutions include adaptive optics (but not providing full correction for short wavelengths) or image slicers (which give feasible but still large instruments). Here we develop the solution proposed by Bland-Hawthorn and Horton: the use of diffraction-limited spectrographs which are compact even for high resolving power. Their use is made possible by the photonic lantern, which splits a multi-mode optical fiber into a number of single-mode fibers. We describe preliminary designs for such spectrographs, at a resolving power of R ~ 50,000. While they are small and use relatively simple optics, the challenges are to accommodate the longest possible fiber slit (hence maximum number of single-mode fibers in one spectrograph) and to accept the beam from each fiber at a focal ratio considerably faster than for most spectrograph collimators, while maintaining diffraction-limited imaging quality. It is possible to obtain excellent performance despite these challenges.

In the Turbulent Extreme Multi-Zone (TEMZ) model being developed by the author, much of the optical and high-energy radiation in a blazar is emitted near the 43 GHz core of the jet as seen in VLBA images, parsecs from the central engine, as indicated by observations of a number of blazars. The model creates simulated light curves through numerical calculations that approximate the behavior of turbulent plasma - modulated by random fluctuations of the jet flow - crossing a cone-shaped standing shock system that compresses the plasma and accelerates electrons to highly relativistic energies. A standing shock oriented transverse to the jet axis (Mach disk) at the vertex of the conical shock can create a variable nonthermal seed photon field that is highly blueshifted in the frame of the faster jet plasma, leading to highly luminous, rapidly variable gamma-ray emission.",12,[],1

We performed the radial velocity (RV) measurement of the system with the Subaru 8.2 m telescope on August 10, 2012 (UT), covering a complete transit of KOI-94.01 for equation hours. The resulting RV variation due to the RM effect spectroscopically confirms that KOI-94.01 is indeed the transiting planet, and implies that its orbital axis is well aligned with the stellar spin axis; the projected spin-orbit angle equation is estimated as equation deg. This is the first measurement of the RM effect for a multiple transiting system. Remarkably, the archived Kepler lightcurve around BJD=2455211.5 (date in UT January 14/15, 2010) indicates a ""ouble transit"" event of KOI-94.01 and KOI-94.03, in which the two planets transit the stellar disk simultaneously. Moreover, the two planets partially overlap each other, and exhibit a ""planet-planet eclipse"" around the transit center. This provides a rare opportunity to put tight constraints on the configuration of the two transiting planets by joint analysis with our Subaru RM measurement.

1201.3329,astro-ph,"(Abridged) Processes driving mass assembly are expected to evolve on different timescales along cosmic time. A transition might happen around z ~ 1 as the cosmic star formation rate starts its decrease. Identifying the dynamical nature of galaxies on a representative sample is necessary to infer and compare the mass assembly mechanisms across cosmic time. We present an analysis of the kinematics properties of 50 galaxies with 0.9 < z < 1.6 from the MASSIV sample observed with SINFONI/VLT with 4.5x109 Msun < M < 1.7x1011 Msun and 6 Msun/yr < SFR < 300 Msun/yr. This is the largest sample with 2D-kinematics in this redshift range. We provide a classification based on kinematics as well as on close galaxy environment. We find that 29% of galaxies are experiencing merging or have close companions that may be gravitationally linked. This is placing a lower limit on the fraction of interacting galaxies. We find that at least 44% of the galaxies display ordered rotation whereas at least 35% are non-rotating objects. All rotators except one are compatible with rotation-dominated (Vmax/sigma > 1) systems. Non-rotating objects are mainly small objects (Re < 4 kpc). Combining our sample with other 3D-spectroscopy samples, we find that the local velocity dispersion of the ionized gas component decreases continuously from z ~ 3 to z = 0. The proportion of disks also seems to be increasing in star-forming galaxies when the redshift decreases. The number of interacting galaxies seems to be at a maximum at z ~ 1.2. These results draw a picture in which cold gas accretion may still be efficient at z ~ 1.2 but in which mergers may play a much more significant role at z ~ 1.2 than at higher redshift. From a dynamical point of view, the redshift range 1 < z < 2 therefore appears as a transition period in the galaxy mass assembly process.",12,[],1
1207.5800,astro-ph,"The cosmological peculiar velocity field (deviations from the pure Hubble flow) of matter carries significant information on dark energy, dark matter and the underlying theory of gravity on large scales. Peculiar motions of galaxies introduce systematic deviations between the observed galaxy redshifts z and the corresponding cosmological redshifts zcos. A novel method for estimating the angular power spectrum of the peculiar velocity field based on observations of galaxy redshifts and apparent magnitudes m (or equivalently fluxes) is presented. This method exploits the fact that a mean relation between zcos and m of galaxies can be derived from all galaxies in a redshift-magnitude survey. Given a galaxy magnitude, it is shown that the zcos(m) relation yields its cosmological redshift with a 1-sigma error of sigmaz~0.3 for a survey like Euclid (~109 galaxies at z<~2), and can be used to constrain the angular power spectrum of z-zcos(m) with a high signal-to-noise ratio. At large angular separations corresponding to l<~15, we obtain significant constraints on the power spectrum of the peculiar velocity field. At 15<~l<~60, magnitude shifts in the zcos(m) relation caused by gravitational lensing magnification dominate, allowing us to probe the line-of-sight integral of the gravitational potential.

In the model, black hole (BH) mass is linearly related to galaxy mass, and galaxies are connected to dark matter halos via empirically constrained relations. A simple ""scattered"" light bulb model for quasars is adopted, wherein BHs shine at a fixed fraction of the Eddington luminosity during accretion episodes, and Eddington ratios are drawn from a lognormal distribution that is redshift-independent. This model has two free, physically meaningful parameters at each redshift: the normalization of the Mbh-Mgal relation and the quasar duty cycle; these parameters are fit to the observed quasar luminosity function (LF) over the interval 0.5<z<6. This simple model provides an excellent fit to the LF at all epochs, and also successfully predicts the observed projected two-point correlation of quasars from 0.5<z<2.5. It is significant that a single quasar duty cycle at each redshift is capable of reproducing the extant observations. The data are therefore consistent with a scenario wherein quasars are equally likely to exist in galaxies, and therefore dark matter halos, over a wide range in masses. The knee in the quasar LF is a reflection of the knee in the stellar mass-halo mass relation. Future constraints on the quasar LF and quasar clustering at high redshift will provide strong constraints on the model. In the model, the autocorrelation function of quasars becomes a strong function of luminosity only at the very highest luminosities, and will be difficult to observe because such quasars are so rare. Cross-correlation techniques may provide useful constraints on the bias of such rare objects.",12,[],1
1211.6743,astro-ph,"We present ALMA continuum and spectral line observations of the young Brown Dwarf rho-Oph 102 at about 0.89 mm and 3.2 mm. We detect dust emission from the disk at these wavelengths and derive an upper limit on the radius of the dusty disk of ~ 40 AU. The derived variation of the dust opacity with frequency in the mm provides evidence for the presence of mm-sized grains in the disk outer regions. This result demonstrates that mm-grains are found even in the low density environments of Brown Dwarf disks and challenges our current understanding of dust evolution in disks. The CO map at 345 GHz clearly reveals molecular gas emission at the location of the Brown Dwarf, indicating a gas-rich disk as typically found for disks surrounding young pre-Main Sequence stars. We derive a disk mass of ~ 0.3-1% of the mass of the central Brown Dwarf, similar to the typical values found for disks around more massive young stars.",12,[],1
1204.6059,astro-ph,"Swift J1749.4-2807 is a transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary that contains an accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar spinning at 518 Hz. It is the first of its kind that displays X-ray eclipses, which holds significant promise to precisely constrain the mass of the neutron star. We report on a ~105 ks long XMM-Newton observation performed when Swift J1749.4-2807 was in quiescence. We detect the source at a 0.5-10 keV luminosity of ~1E33(D/6.7 kpc)2 erg/s. The X-ray light curve displays three eclipses that are consistent in orbital phase and duration with the ephemeris derived during outburst. Unlike most quiescent neutron stars, the X-ray spectrum is best described with a simple power law, while a pure-hydrogen atmosphere model does not fit the data. We place an upper limit on the 0.01-100 keV thermal luminosity of the cooling neutron star of <2E33 erg/s and constrain its temperature to be <0.1 keV (for an observer at infinity). Timing analysis does not reveal evidence for X-ray pulsations near the known spin frequency of the neutron star or its first overtone with a fractional rms of <34% and <28%, respectively. We discuss the implications of our findings for dynamical mass measurements, the thermal state of the neutron star and the origin of the quiescent X-ray emission.",12,[],1
1209.5797,astro-ph,"A sequence of apparently coupled eruptions was observed on 2010 August 1-2 by SDO and STEREO. The eruptions were closely synchronized with one another, even though some of them occurred at widely separated locations. In an attempt to identify a plausible reason for such synchronization, we study the large-scale structure of the background magnetic configuration. The coronal field was computed from the photospheric magnetic field observed at the appropriate time period by using the potential field source-surface model.   We investigate the resulting field structure by analyzing the so-called squashing factor calculated at the photospheric and source-surface boundaries, as well as at different coronal cross-sections. Using this information as a guide, we determine the underlying structural skeleton of the configuration, including separatrix and quasi-separatrix surfaces. Our analysis reveals, in particular, several pseudo-streamers in the regions where the eruptions occurred. Of special interest to us are the magnetic null points and separators associated with the pseudo-streamers. We propose that magnetic reconnection triggered along these separators by the first eruption likely played a key role in establishing the assumed link between the sequential eruptions. The present work substantiates our recent simplified magnetohydrodynamic model of sympathetic eruptions and provides a guide for further deeper study of these phenomena. Several important implications of our results for the S-web model of the slow solar wind are also addressed.",12,[],1
1204.0275,astro-ph,"We present a model for the evolution of the magnetic properties of habitable terrestrial planets and their effects on the protection of planetary atmosphere against the erosive action of stellar wind. Using up-to-date thermal evolution models and dynamo scaling laws we predict the evolution of the planetary dipole moment as a function of planetary mass and rotation rate. Combining these results with models for the evolution of the stellar wind, stellar XUV fluxes and planetary exosphere characteristics, we determine the properties of the magnetosphere and the exobase radius in order to estimate the level of atmospheric mass losses. We use this model to evaluate the magnetic protection of the potentially habitable super-Earths GJ 667Cc, Gl 581d and HD 85512b. We confirm that Earth-like planets, even under the highest attainable magnetic field strengths, will lose a significant fraction of their atmospheric volatiles if they are tidally locked in the habitable zone of dM stars, or even if having N/O-rich atmospheres they are in habitable zones closer than equation 0.8 AU. Similar mass-dependent inner limits have been found for super-Earths equation that in any case seem to have better chances of preserving their atmospheres even if they are tidally locked. We predict that the atmosphere of GJ 667Cc has probably already been obliterated and it is presently uninhabitable. On the other hand, our model predicts that the atmospheres of Gl 581d and HD 85512b would be well protected by intrinsic magnetic fields, even under the worst expected conditions of stellar aggression.

1202.4870,astro-ph,"We summarize the principles and fundamental ingredients of evolutionary synthesis models, which are stellar evolution, stellar atmospheres, the IMF, star-formation histories, nebular emission, and also attenuation from the ISM and IGM. The chapter focusses in particular on issues of importance for predictions of metal-poor and Population III dominated galaxies.   We review recent predictions for the main physical properties and related observables of star-forming galaxies based on up-to-date inputs. The predicted metallicity dependence of these quantities and their physical causes are discussed. The predicted observables include in particular the restframe UV-to-optical domain with continuum emission from stars and the ionized ISM, as well as emission lines from H, He, and metals.   Based on these predictions we summarize the main observational signatures (emission line strengths, colors etc.), which can be used to distinguish ""normal"" stellar populations from very metal-poor objects or even Pop III.   Evolutionary synthesis models provide an important and fundamental tool for studies of galaxy formation and evolution, from the nearby Universe back to first galaxies.

1204.4633,astro-ph,"We analyse a large number (equation) pointed RXTE observations of Cyg X-1 and model the spectrum of each one. A subset of the observations for which there is simultaneous reliable measure of the hardness ratio by the All Sky Monitor, shows that the sample covers nearly all the spectral shapes of Cyg X-1. The relative strength, width of the Iron line and the reflection parameter are in general correlated with the high energy photon spectral index equation. This is broadly consistent with a geometry where for the hard state (low equation) there is a hot inner Comptonizing region surrounded by a truncated cold disk. The inner edge of the disk moves inwards as the source becomes softer till finally in the soft state (high equation) the disk fills the inner region and active regions above the disk produce the Comptonized component. However, the reflection parameter shows non-monotonic behaviour near the transition region (equation), suggestive of a more complex geometry or physical state of the reflector. Additionally, the inner disk temperature, during the hard state, is on the average higher than in the soft one, albeit with large scatter. These inconsistencies could be due to limitations in the data and the empirical model used to fit them. The flux of each spectral component is well correlated with equation which shows that unlike some other black hole systems, Cyg X-1 does not show any hysteresis behaviour. In the soft state, the flux of the Comptonized component is always similar to the disk one, which confirms that the ultra-soft state (seen in other brighter black hole systems) is not exhibited by Cyg X-1. The rapid variation of the Compton Amplification factor with equation, naturally explains the absence of spectra with equation, despite a large number having equation.",12,[],1
1208.6234,astro-ph,"Several independent measurements have confirmed the existence of fluctuations (equation at equation) up to degree angular scales in the source-subtracted Near InfraRed Background (NIRB) whose origin is unknown. By combining high resolution cosmological N-body/hydrodynamical simulations with an analytical model, and by matching galaxy Luminosity Functions (LFs) and the constraints on reionization simultaneously, we predict the NIRB absolute flux and fluctuation amplitude produced by high-equation (equation) galaxies (some of which harboring Pop III stars, shown to provide a negligible contribution). This strategy also allows us to make an empirical determination of the evolution of ionizing photon escape fraction: we find equation at equation, decreasing to equation at equation. In the wavelength range equation, the predicted cumulative flux is equation. However, we find that the radiation from high-equation galaxies (including those undetected by current surveys) is insufficient to explain the amplitude of the observed fluctuations: at equation, the fluctuation level due to equation galaxies is equation, with a relative wavelength-independent amplitude equation%. The source of the missing power remains unknown. This might indicate that an unknown component/foreground, with a clustering signal very similar to that of high-equation galaxies, dominates the source-subtracted NIRB fluctuation signal.",12,[],1
1204.4469,astro-ph,"Galactic black hole coronae are composed of a hot, magnetized plasma. The spectral energy distribution produced in this component of X-ray binaries can be strongly affected by different interactions between locally injected relativistic particles and the matter, radiation and magnetic fields in the source. We study the non-thermal processes driven by the injection of relativistic particles into a strongly magnetized corona around an accreting black hole. We compute in a self-consistent way the effects of relativistic bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton scattering, synchrotron radiation, and the pair-production/annihilation of leptons, as well as hadronic interactions. Our goal is to determine the non-thermal broadband radiative output of the corona. The set of coupled kinetic equations for electrons, positrons, protons, and photons are solved and the resulting particle distributions are computed self-consistently. The spectral energy distributions of transient events in X-ray binaries are calculated, as well as the neutrino production. We show that the application to Cygnus X-1 of our model of non-thermal emission from a magnetized corona yields a good fit to the observational data. Finally, we show that the accumulated signal produced by neutrino bursts in black hole coronae might be detectable for sources within a few kpc on timescales of years. Our work leads to predictions for non-thermal photon and neutrino emission generated around accreting black holes, that can be tested by the new generation of very high energy gamma-ray and neutrino instruments.",12,[],1
1212.2999,astro-ph,"We present results from a study to determine whether relations, established in the local Universe, between the mass of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies are in place at higher redshifts. We establish a well-constructed sample of 18 X-ray-selected, broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South - Survey with 0.5 < z < 1.2. This redshift range is chosen to ensure that HST imaging is available with at least two filters that bracket the 4000 Angstrom break thus providing reliable stellar mass estimates of the host galaxy by accounting for both young and old stellar populations. We compute single-epoch, virial black hole masses from optical spectra using the broad MgII emission line. For essentially all galaxies in our sample, their total stellar mass content agrees remarkably well, given their BH masses, with local relations of inactive galaxies and active SMBHs. We further decompose the total stellar mass into bulge and disk components separately with full knowledge of the HST point-spread-function. We find that ~80% of the sample is consistent with the local MBH - MBulge relation even with 72% of the host galaxies showing the presence of a disk. In particular, bulge dominated hosts are more aligned with the local relation than those with prominent disks. We further discuss the possible physical mechanisms that are capable building up the stellar mass of the bulge from an extended disk of stars over the subsequent eight Gyrs.",12,[],1
1201.1961,astro-ph,"We investigate the effect of photodesorption on the snow line position at the surface of a protoplanetary disk around a Herbig Ae/Be star, motivated by the detection of water ice particles at the surface of the disk around HD142527 by Honda et al. For this aim, we obtain the density and temperature structure in the disk with a 11D radiative transfer and determine the distribution of water ice particles in the disk by the balance between condensation, sublimation, and photodesorption. We find that photodesorption induced by the far-ultraviolet radiation from the central star depresses the ice-condensation front toward the mid-plane and pushes the surface snow line outward significantly when the stellar effective temperature exceeds a certain critical value. This critical effective temperature depends on the stellar luminosity and mass, the water abundance in the disk, and the yield of photodesorption. We present an approximate analytic formula for the critical temperature. We separate Herbig Ae/Be stars into two groups on the HR diagram according to the critical temperature; one is the disks where photodesorption is effective and from which we may not find ice particles at the surface, and the other is the disks where photodesorption is not effective. We estimate the snow line position at the surface of the disk around HD142527 to be 100--300 AU which is consistent with the water ice detection at >140 AU in the disk. All results depend on the dust grain size by a complex way and this point requires more work in future.",12,[],1

After the initial canonical X-ray hard state, the outburst evolved into a hard intermediate state and then went back to the hard state. The existing RATAN-600 radio monitoring observations revealed that it was variable on a timescale of days and had a flat or inverted spectrum, consistent with optically thick synchrotron emission, possibly from a self-absorbed jet in the vicinity of the central compact object. We observed the transient in the hard state near the end of the X-ray outburst with the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 5 GHz and the Chinese VLBI Network (CVN) at 2.3 and 8.3 GHz. The 8.3 GHz observations were carried out at a recording rate of 2048 Mbps using the newly-developed Chinese VLBI data acquisition system (CDAS), twice higher than the recording rate used in the other observations.

1205.4835,astro-ph,"We study the effect of turbulent drift of a large-scale magnetic field that results from the interaction of helical convective motions and differential rotation in the solar convection zone. The principal direction of the drift corresponds to the direction of the large-scale vorticity vector. Thus, the effect produces a latitudinal transport of the large-scale magnetic field in the convective zone wherever the angular velocity has a strong radial gradient. The direction of the drift depends on the sign of helicity and it is defined by the Parker-Yoshimura rule. The analytic calculations are done within the framework of mean-field magnetohydrodynamics using the minimal letter-approximation. We estimate the magnitude of the drift velocity and find that it can be several m/s near the base of the solar convection zone. The implications of this effect for the solar dynamo are illustrated on the basis of an axisymmetric mean-field dynamo model with a subsurface shear layer. We find that the helicity--vorticity pumping effect can have an influence on the features of the sunspot time--latitude diagram, producing a fast drift of the sunspot activity maximum at the rise phase of the cycle and a slow drift at the decay phase of the cycle.",12,[],1
1208.6352,astro-ph,"We develop a general framework for quantifying the many different contributions to the noise budget of an image made with an array of dishes or aperture array stations. Each noise contribution to the visibility data is associated with a relevant correlation timescale and frequency bandwidth so that the net impact on a complete observation can be assessed. All quantities are parameterised as function of observing frequency and the visibility baseline length. We apply the resulting noise budget analysis to a wide range of existing and planned telescope systems that will operate between about 100 MHz and 5 GHz to ascertain the magnitude of the calibration challenges that they must overcome to achieve thermal noise limited performance. We conclude that calibration challenges are increased in several respects by small dimensions of the dishes or aperture array stations. It will be more challenging to achieve thermal noise limited performance using 15 m class dishes rather than the 25 m dishes of current arrays. Some of the performance risks are mitigated by the deployment of phased array feeds and more with the choice of an (alt,az,pol) mount, although a larger dish diameter offers the best prospects for risk mitigation. Many improvements to imaging performance can be anticipated at the expense of greater complexity in calibration algorithms. However, a fundamental limitation is ultimately imposed by an insufficient number of data constraints relative to calibration variables. The upcoming aperture array systems will be operating in a regime that has never previously been addressed, where a wide range of effects are expected to exceed the thermal noise by two to three orders of magnitude. Achieving routine thermal noise limited imaging performance with these systems presents an extreme challenge. The magnitude of that challenge is inversely related to the aperture array station diameter.",12,[],1
1209.1640,astro-ph,"Using the wide multi-band photometry available in the COSMOS field we explore the host galaxy properties of a large sample of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) obtained by combining X-ray and optical spectroscopic selections. Based on a careful study of their Spectral Energy Distribution (SED), which has been parametrized using a 2-component (AGNgalaxy) model fit, we derived dust-corrected rest-frame magnitudes, colors, stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs). We find that AGN hosts span a large range of stellar masses and SFRs. No color-bimodality is seen at any redshift in the AGN hosts, which are found to be mainly massive, red galaxies. Once accounting for the color-mass degeneracy in well defined mass-matched samples, we find a residual marginal enhancement of AGN incidence in redder galaxies with lower specific star formation rates, and we argue that this result might emerge because of our ability to properly account for AGN light contamination and dust extinction. Interestingly, we find that the probability for a galaxy to host a black hole growing at any given ""specific accretion rate"" (i.e. the ratio of X-ray luminosity to the host stellar mass) is almost independent of the host galaxy mass, while it decreases as a power-law with Lx/M. By analyzing the normalization of such probability distribution, we show how the incidence of AGN increases with redshift as rapidly as (1z)4, in close resemblance with the overall evolution of the specific star formation rate of the entire galaxy population. Although AGN activity and star formation in galaxies do appear to have a common triggering mechanism, at least in a statistical sense, within the COSMOS sample we do not find strong evidence of any 'smoking gun' signaling powerful AGN influence on the star-forming properties of their hosts galaxies.",12,[],1

1208.4657,astro-ph,"Most star formation in our galaxy occurs within embedded clusters, and these background environments can affect the star and planet formation processes occurring within them. In turn, young stellar members can shape the background environment and thereby provide a feedback mechanism. This work explores one aspect of stellar feedback by quantifying the background X-ray radiation fields produced by young stellar objects. Specifically, the distributions of X-ray luminosities and X-ray fluxes produced by cluster environments are constructed as a function of cluster membership size equation. Composite flux distributions, for given distributions of cluster sizes equation, are also constructed. The resulting distributions are wide and the X-ray radiation fields are moderately intense, with the expected flux levels exceeding the cosmic and galactic X-ray backgrounds by factors of equation (for energies 0.2 -- 15 keV). For circumstellar disks that are geometrically thin and optically thick, the X-ray flux from the background cluster dominates that provided by a typical central star in the outer disk where equation AU. In addition, the expectation value of the ionization rate provided by the cluster X-ray background is equation sequation, about 4 -- 8 times larger than the canonical value of the ionization rate from cosmic rays. These elevated flux levels in clusters indicate that X-rays can affect ionization, chemistry, and heating in circumstellar disks and in the material between young stellar objects.",12,[],1

The strain-induced modulation of the magnetic anisotropy can play the role of a high frequency varying effective magnetic field leading to ultrasonic tuning of electronic and magnetic properties of nanostructured materials, eventually integrated in semiconductor technology. Here, we report about the opportunity to employ surface acoustic waves to trigger magnetocaloric effect in MnAs(100nm)/GaAs(001) thin films. During the MnAs magnetostructural phase transition, in an interval range around room temperature (0\degC - 60\degC), ultrasonic waves (170 MHz) are strongly attenuated by the phase coexistence (up to 150 dB/cm). We show that the giant magnetocaloric effect of MnAs is responsible of the observed phenomenon.

1203.4055,cond-mat,"We address the cross effects between mechanical strains and magnetic fields on the plastic response of magnetoelastic amorphous solids. It is well known that plasticity in non-magnetic amorphous solids under external strain equation is dominated by the co-dimension 1 saddle-node bifurcation in which an eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix vanishes at equation like equation. This square-root singularity determines much of the statistical physics of elasto-plasticity, and in particular that of the stress-strain curves under athermal-quasistatic conditions. In this Letter we discuss the much richer physics that can be expected in magnetic amorphous solids. Firstly, magnetic amorphous solids exhibit co-dimension 2 plastic instabilities, when an external strain and an external magnetic field are applied simultaneously.

The band gaps shows red shift with doping and the width of localized states shows an increasing tendency with doping concentration. It is due to the formation of impurity band and trapping of Mn atoms, which leads to the generation of the defect states within the forbidden band. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra shows gradual decrease of intensity of exitonic and defect related peaks with increasing Mn doping. Defect mediated intrinsic ferromagnetism has been observed even at room temperaturenfor 5at% Mn doped ZnO film. The strong presence of antiferromagnetic (AFM) interaction reduces the observed ferromagnetic moments.",12,[],8

The magnetic excitation spectrum obtained from the inelastic neutron scattering experiments exhibits three modes at energy transfers of equation, 1.35, and 1.6 meV. We show that the energy, momentum, and temperature dependences of the inelastic neutron scattering data and equation can be well reproduced by an effective spin Hamiltonian consisted of intra-molecule exchange interactions, a single-ionic anisotropy, biquadratic interactions, and Zeeman term. Under a hydrostatic pressure, the bulk magnetization decreases with increasing pressure, which along with the biquadratic term indicates spin-lattice coupling present in this system.",12,[],8
1211.2695,cond-mat,"The correlation between structural distortion and emergence of magnetism in graphene containing a single vacancy was investigated using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Our results have shown that a local distortion is formed around the vacancy, with reconstruction of two atomic bonds and with a dangling bond remaining at the third atom adjacent to the vacancy. A systematic investigation of the possible out-of-plane displacement of this third atom was then carried out, in order to ascertain its effects on the magnetic features of the system. The ground state was definitely found to be magnetic and planar, with spin-resolved equation and equation bands contributing to the total magnetic moment. However, we have also found that metastable solutions can be achieved if an initial shift of the third atom above a minimum threshold from the graphene plane is provided, which leads to a non-planar geometry and a non-magnetic state.",12,[],8
1207.7145,cond-mat,"BaRuO3 having five different crystal structures has been synthesized by varying the pressure while sintering. Contrary to the other phases being nonmagnetic, the cubic perovskite phase synthesized recently shows an itinerant ferromagnetic character. We investigated this ferromagnetic BaRuO3 using first principles calculations. A few van Hove singularities appear around the Fermi energy, causing unusually high magnetovolume effects of equation ~ 4.3 equation/\AA as well as a Stoner instability [IN(0) ~ 1.2]. At the optimized lattice parameter a, the magnetic moment M is 1.01 equation in the local spin density approximation. When spin-orbit coupling is included, the topologies of some Fermi surfaces are altered, and the net moment is reduced by 10% to a value very close to the experimentally observed value of ~ 0.8 equation. Our results indicate that this ferromagnetism is induced by the Stoner instability, but the combined effects of the p-d hybridization, the magnetovolume, and the spin-orbit coupling determine the net moment. In addition, we briefly discuss the results of the tight-binding Wannier function technique.",12,[],8

1201.0751,cond-mat,"The thickness vibrations of a finitely deformed infinite periodic laminate made out of two layers of dielectric elastomers is studied. The laminate is pre-stretched by inducing a bias electric field perpendicular the the layers. Incremental time-harmonic fields superimposed on the initial finite deformation are considered next. Utilizing the Bloch-Floquet theorem along with the transfer matrix method we determine the dispersion relation which relates the incremental fields frequency and the phase velocity.   Ranges of frequencies at which waves cannot propagate are identified whenever the Bloch-parameter is complex. These band-gaps depend on the phases properties, their volume fraction, and most importantly on the electric bias field. Our analysis reveals how these band-gaps can be shifted and their width can be modified by changing the bias electric field. This implies that by controlling the electrostatic bias field desired frequencies can be filtered out. Representative examples of laminates with different combinations of commercially available dielectric elastomers are examined.",12,[],8
1211.1756,cond-mat,"Structural transformations at interfaces are of profound fundamental interest as complex examples of phase transitions in low-dimensional systems. Despite decades of extensive research, no compelling evidence exists for structural transformations in high-angle grain boundaries in elemental systems. Here we show that the critical impediment to observations of such phase transformations in atomistic modeling has been rooted in inadequate simulation methodology. The proposed new methodology allows variations in atomic density inside the grain boundary and reveals multiple grain boundary phases with different atomic structures. Reversible first-order transformations between such phases are observed by varying temperature or injecting point defects into the boundary region. Due to the presence of multiple metastable phases, grain boundaries can absorb significant amounts of point defects created inside the material by processes such as irradiation. We propose a novel mechanism of radiation damage healing in metals which may guide further improvements in radiation resistance of metallic materials through grain boundary engineering.",12,[],8

This same field-to-current scaling is shown to hold in both the slow thermally activated and fast near-flow regimes of DW motion. The current-induced torque decreases with 4 \AA of Pt decorating the Co/GdOx interface and vanishes entirely with Pt replacing GdOx, suggesting that the Co/GdOx interface contributes directly to highly efficient current-driven DW motion.",12,[],8
1210.0409,cond-mat,"It is known from self-energy calculations in the electron gas and sp materials based on the GW approximation that a typical quasiparticle renormalization factor (Z factor) is approximately 0.7-0.8. Band narrowing in electron gas at rs = 4 due to correlation effects, however, is only approximately 10%, significantly smaller than the Z factor would suggest. The band narrowing is determined by the frequency-dependent self-energy, giving the Z factor, and the momentum-dependent or nonlocal self-energy. The results for the electron gas point to a strong cancellation between the effects of frequency- and momentum-dependent self-energy. It is often assumed that for systems with a nar- row band the self-energy is local. In this work we show that even for narrow-band materials, such as SrVO3, the nonlocal self-energy is important.",12,[],8

In agreement with a simple geometrical model, the solid fraction is found to decrease linearly for increasing confinement no matter the grain shape. Furthermore, this decrease remains valid for bidisperse sphere packings although the gradient seems to reduce significantly when the proportion of small particles reaches 40% by volume.

1201.4309,cond-mat,"Using Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling, we investigate the XY antiferromagnet on the triangular, Union Jack and bisected-hexagonal lattices, and in each case find both Ising and Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. As is well-known, on the triangular lattice, as the temperature decreases the system develops chiral order for temperatures equation, and then quasi-long-range magnetic order on its sublattices when equation, with equation. The behavior equation is predicted by theoretical arguments due to Korshunov, based on the unbinding of kink-antikink pairs. On the Union Jack and bisected-hexagonal lattices, by contrast, we find that as equation decreases the magnetizations on some of the sublattices become quasi-long-range ordered at a temperature equation, before chiral order develops. In some cases, the sublattice spins then undergo a second transition, of Ising type, separating two quasi-long-range ordered phases. On the Union Jack lattice, the magnetization on the degree-4 sublattice remains disordered until equation and then undergoes an Ising transition to a quasi-long-range ordered phase.",12,[],8
1211.3084,cond-mat,"The long-range proximity effect in superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) hybrid nano-structures is observed if singlet Cooper pairs from the superconductor are converted into triplet pairs which can diffuse into the fer- romagnet over large distances. It is commonly believed that this happens only in the presence of magnetic inhomogeneities. We show that there are other sources of the long-range triplet component (LRTC) of the con- densate and establish general conditions for their occurrence. As a prototypical example we consider first a system where the exchange field and spin-orbit coupling can be treated as time and space components of an effective SU(2) potential. We derive a SU(2) covariant diffusive equation for the condensate and demonstrate that an effective SU(2) electric field is responsible for the long-range proximity effect. Finally, we extend our analysis to a generic ferromagnet and establish a universal condition for the LRTC. Our results open a new avenue in the search for such correlations in S/F structures and make a hitherto unknown connection between the LRTC and Yang-Mills electrostatics.",12,[],8

The first order phase transition for equation between dimer and plaquette phase is compatible with previous series expansion results. iPEPS predicts a weak first-order phase transition between plaquette and N\'eel phase occurring for equation.

1210.0245,cond-mat,"The small wavenumber equation behavior of the structure factor equation of overcompressed amorphous hard-sphere configurations was previously studied for a wide range of densities up to the maximally random jammed state, which can be viewed as a prototypical glassy state [A. Hopkins, F. H. Stillinger and S. Torquato, Phys. Rev. E, 86, 021505 (2012)]. It was found that a precursor to the glassy jammed state was evident long before the jamming density was reached as measured by a growing nonequilibrium length scale extracted from the volume integral of the direct correlation function equation, which becomes long-ranged as the critical jammed state is reached. The present study extends that work by investigating via computer simulations two different atomic models: the single-component Z2 Dzugutov potential in three dimensions and the binary-mixture Kob-Andersen potential in two dimensions. Consistent with the aforementioned hard-sphere study, we demonstrate that for both models a signature of the glass transition is apparent well before the transition temperature is reached as measured by the length scale determined from from the volume integral of the direct correlation function in the single-component case and a generalized direct correlation function in the binary-mixture case. The latter quantity is obtained from a generalized Orstein-Zernike integral equation for a certain decoration of the atomic point configuration. We also show that these growing length scales, which are a consequence of the long-range nature of the direct correlation functions, are intrinsically nonequilibrium in nature as determined by an index equation that is a measure of deviation from thermal equilibrium. It is also demonstrated that this nonequilibrium index, which increases upon supercooling, is correlated with a characteristic relaxation time scale.",12,[],8

We expand this action up to the second order with respect to the magnetization field, which allows to describe nonequilibrium interacting quantum dots at low temperatures and weak electron-electron interactions,up to the contacts-dot coupling energy. Besides its simplicity, an additional advantage of the theory is that it correctly describes the unitary limit giving the correct result for the conductance maximum.

While these developments prove particularly useful in the calculation of transient response and finite temperature Green's functions of quantum impurity models, they may also be used to calculate thermodynamic properties. In this paper, we assess the FDM approach to thermodynamic properties by applying it to the Anderson impurity model. We compare the results for the susceptibility and specific heat to both the conventional approach within NRG and to exact Bethe ansatz results. We also point out a subtlety in the calculation of the susceptibility (in a uniform field) within the FDM approach.

By combining thermodynamic measurements with electron spin resonance (ESR), we demonstrate that this is a new SC transition. Structural analysis unambiguously reveals two phases coexisting in the crystals, which are responsible respectively for the SC transitions at 30 and 44 K. The structural experiments and first-principles calculations consistently indicate that the 44 K SC phase is close to a 122 structure, but with an unexpectedly large c-axis of 18.10 \AA.

At low temperatures, all the ex-situ junctions showed coherence peaks in their conductance spectra, but imbedded robust zero bias conductance peaks were observed only in junctions with a metallic or a metal to insulator transition below equation of the NbN electrode. The in-situ junctions which had about two orders of magnitude lower resistance at low temperatures, generally showed flat conductance spectra at low bias, with no coherence or broad Andreev peaks, since the critical current of the NbN electrode was reached first, at voltage bias below the energy gap of the superconductor. A weak zero bias conductance peak however, was observed in one of these junctions. We conclude that significant tunneling barriers, as in the ex-situ prepared junctions, are essential for the observation of coherence peaks and the zero energy bound states. The later seem to originate in the equation-NbN interface, as they are absent in reference Au-NbN junctions without the topological layer sandwiched in between.",12,[],8
1208.6526,cond-mat,"We present a lumped model for the rotational modes induced by the rotational motion of individual scatterers in two-dimensional phononic crystals comprised of square arrays of solid cylindrical scatterers in solid hosts. The model provides a physical interpretation of the origin of the rotational modes, reveals the important role played by the rotational motion in the band structure, and reproduces the dispersion relations. The model increases the possibilities of wave manipulation in phononic crystals. In particular, expressions, derived from the model, for eigen-frequencies at high symmetry points unambiguously predict the presence of a new type of Dirac-like cone at the Brillouin center, which is found to be the result of accidental degeneracy of the rotational and dipolar modes.",12,[],8

Particular attention is given to the time of exponential relaxation and ferromagnetic resonance linewidth which are derived in analytic form from the equation of magnetization energy loss and Gabor uncertainty relation between the full-width-at-half-maximum in resonance-shaped line and lifetime of resonance excitation.

The master equation satisfying detailed balance can be mapped onto a quantum Hamiltonian which has an exact zero-energy ground state representing the thermal equilibrium. The largest relaxation time equation governing the convergence towards this Boltzmann equilibrium in finite-size systems is determined by the lowest non-vanishing eigenvalue equation of the quantum Hamiltonian equation. We introduce and study a real-space renormalization procedure for the quantum Hamiltonian associated to the single-spin-flip dynamics of Ising ferromagnets near zero temperature. We solve explicitly the renormalization flow for two cases.

1212.2203,cond-mat,"The quantum spin Hall (QSH) state is a genuinely new state of matter characterized by a non-trivial topology of its band structure. Its key feature is conducting edge channels whose spin polarization has potential for spintronic and quantum information applications. The QSH state was predicted and experimentally demonstrated to exist in HgTe quantum wells. The existence of the edge channels has been inferred from the fact that local and non-local conductance values in sufficiently small devices are close to the quantized values expected for ideal edge channels and from signatures of the spin polarization. The robustness of the edge channels in larger devices and the interplay between the edge channels and a conducting bulk are relatively unexplored experimentally, and are difficult to assess via transport measurements. Here we image the current in large Hallbars made from HgTe quantum wells by probing the magnetic field generated by the current using a scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). We observe that the current flows along the edge of the device in the QSH regime, and furthermore that an identifiable edge channel exists even in the presence of disorder and considerable bulk conduction as the device is gated or its temperature is raised. Our results represent a versatile method for the characterization of new quantum spin Hall materials systems, and confirm both the existence and the robustness of the predicted edge channels.",12,[],8

The results show, small clusters up to equation stabilize in the 2D ring shape geometries while the larger clusters prefer the 3D cage like structures. The ring to cage structural cross over in ZnO clusters is studied by investigating the behavior of the Zn-O-Zn bond angle, the Zn-O bond strength, and the number of bonds in the systems. It is argued that 12 is the lowest magic number of ZnO clusters at ground state, while finite temperature vibrational excitations enhance the relative stability of the (ZnO)equation cluster and make it a magic system at temperatures above about 170 K. The obtained electronic structure of ZnO clusters before and after applying the many-body GW corrections evidence a size induced red shift originated from the ring to cage structural cross over in these systems. The behavior of the extremal points of electron density of the clusters along with the extrapolated cluster binding energies at very large sizes may be evidences for existence of a metastable structure for large ZnO nanostructures, different with the bulk ZnO structure.",12,[],8
1206.4387,cond-mat,"We numerically study the thermoelectric and thermal transport in trilayer graphene with different stacking orders in the presence of interlayer bias under a strong perpendicular magnetic field. In biased ABA-stacked case, we find that the thermoelectric conductivity displays different asymptotic behaviors with the varying of the temperature, similar to that of monolayer graphene. In the high temperature regime, the transverse thermoelectric conductivity equation saturates to a universal value equation at the center of each LL, while it displays a linear temperature dependence at low temperatures limit. The calculated transverse thermal conductivity equation exhibits two plateaus away from the band center. The transition between the two plateaus is continuous, which is accompanied by a pronounced peak in the longitudinal thermal conductivity equation. In biased ABC-stacked case, it is found that both the thermoelectric conductivity and thermal conductivity have similar properties to the biased bilayer graphene, which is consistent with the behavior of a band insulator.

A band gap energy of 3.270.03 eV was estimated for the material with higher sodium content while a value of 2.810.02 eV was inferred for the most protonated material, which therefore exhibits an absorption edge in the near visible region. The point of zero charge of the materials was determined and the influence of the sodium content on the adsorption of both cationic and anionic organic dyes was studied.

1203.1351,cond-mat,"With a view towards optimizing gas storage and separation in crystalline and disordered nanoporous carbon-based materials, we use ab initio density functional theory calculations to explore the effect of chemical functionalization on gas binding to exposed edges within model carbon nanostructures. We test the geometry, energetics, and charge distribution of in-plane and out-of-plane binding of CO2 and CH4 to model zigzag graphene nanoribbons edge-functionalized with COOH, OH, NH2, H2PO3, NO2, and CH3. Although different choices for the exchange-correlation functional lead to a spread of values for the binding energy, trends across the functional groups are largely preserved for each choice, as are the final orientations of the adsorbed gas molecules. We find binding of CO2 to exceed that of CH4 by roughly a factor of two. However, the two gases follow very similar trends with changes in the attached functional group, despite different molecular symmetries. Our results indicate that the presence of NH2, H2PO3, NO2, and COOH functional groups can significantly enhance gas binding with respect to a hydrogen-passivated edge, making the edges potentially viable binding sites in materials with high concentrations of edge carbons. To first order, in-plane binding strength correlates with the larger permanent and induced dipole moments on these groups. Implications for tailoring carbon structures for increased gas uptake and improved CO2/CH4 selectivity are discussed.",12,[],8

This paper addresses the issue of a possible thermodynamic characterization of the adlayer under reactive conditions and at the steady state. In turn, this implies to tackle the question of determining the temperature of the ad-atoms. This is done by means of a nonequilibrium statistical thermodynamic approach, by exploiting a suitable definition of the entropy. The interplay between reaction rate, vibrational temperature of the ad-atoms and adsorbed quantities is highlighted. It is shown that the vibrational temperature depends on reaction rate logarithmically and exhibits a non-linear scaling on physical quantities linked to the energetics of the reaction, namely the adsorption energy and the binding energy of the molecule.

The field also increases stripe correlations between the planes, which can result in an enhanced frustration of the interlayer Josephson coupling.

1207.3145,cond-mat,"Exotic superconductivity has often been discovered in materials with a layered (two-dimensional) crystal structure. The low dimensionality can affect the electronic structure and can realize high transition temperatures (Tc) and/or unconventional superconductivity mechanisms. As standard examples, we now have two types of high-Tc superconductors. The first group is the Cu-oxide superconductors whose crystal structure is basically composed of a stacking of spacer (blocking) layers and superconducting CuO2 layers.1-4 The second group is the Fe-based superconductors which also possess a stacking structure of spacer layers and superconducting Fe2An2 (An = P, As, Se, Te) layers.5-13 In both systems, dramatic enhancements of Tc are achieved by optimizing the spacer layer structure, for instance, a variety of composing elements, spacer thickness, and carrier doping levels with respect to the superconducting layers. In this respect, to realize higher-Tc superconductivity, other than Cu-oxide and Fe-based superconductors, the discovery of a new prototype of layered superconductors needs to be achieved. Here we show superconductivity in a new bismuth-oxysulfide layered compound Bi4O4S3. Crystal structure analysis indicates that this superconductor has a layered structure composed of stacking of Bi4O4(SO4)1-x and Bi2S4 layers; the parent compound (x = 0) is Bi6O8S5. Band calculation suggests that Bi4O4S3 (x = 0.5) is metallic while Bi6O8S5 (x = 0) is a band insulator with Bi3. Furthermore, the Fermi level for Bi4O4S3 is just on the peak position of the partial density of states of the Bi 6p orbital within the BiS2 layer.

1204.4132,cond-mat,"The `system-plus-reservoir' (SPR) model is the most common and effective approach to study quantum dissipative effects. Indeed, it makes quantization possible by considering the whole energy-conserving system, while the reservoir's degrees of freedom, assumed to be harmonic, can be `traced out' by the path-integral technique, leading to a formulation that only includes the system of interest. In the standard SPR model the environment is only coupled with the system's coordinate and turns out to quench its quantum fluctuations. However, there are physical systems coupled with an environment whose `coordinates' and `momenta' can be completely interchangeable (e.g., magnets), so an SPR coupling must symmetrically affect both canonical variables. In this paper such a general environmental coupling is studied in the case of a harmonic oscillator. It is found that quantum fluctuations are generally enhanced by environmental coupling, with an unexpected nonmonotonic behavior. This leads one to speculate about the possibility that spin-lattice coupling could drive the 2D Heisenberg antiferromagnet to reach its quantum-critical point.",12,[],8

1211.5747,cs,"Dynamic network reconfiguration is described as the process of replacing one routing function with another while the network keeps running. The main challenge is avoiding deadlock anomalies while keeping limitations on message injection and forwarding minimal. Current approaches, whose complexity is so high that their practical applicability is limited, either require the existence of extra network resources like virtual channels, or they affect the performance of the network during the reconfiguration process. In this paper we present a simple, fast and efficient mechanism for dynamic network reconfiguration which is based on regressive deadlock recoveries instead of avoiding deadlocks. The mechanism which is referred to as DBR guarantees a deadlock-free reconfiguration based on wormhole switching (WS) and it does not require additional resources. In this approach, the need for a reliable message transmission has led to a modified WS mechanism which includes additional flits or control signals. DBR allows cycles to be formed and in such conditions when a deadlock occurs, the messages suffer from time-out. Then, this method releases the buffers and channels from the current node and thus the source retransmits the message after a random time gap. Evaluating results reveal that the mechanism shows substantial performance improvements over the other methods and it works efficiently in different topologies with various routing algorithms.",12,[],7

One issue that remains to be addressed in behavioral networks is node co-operation in forwarding packets. Nodes might behave selfishly (due to bandwidth preservation, energy /power constraints) or maliciously by dropping packets or not forwarding them to other nodes based on profile similarity. In both cases the net result is degradation in the performance of the network. It is our goal to show that the performance of the behavioral network can be improved by employing self-policing scheme that would detect node misbehavior and then decide how to tackle them in order to ensure node cooperation or so that the overall performance does not fall below a certain threshold.

We model this scenario by an influence game, a cooperative simple game in which a team (or coalition) of players succeeds if it is able to convince enough agents to participate in the task (to vote in favor of a decision). We take the linear threshold model as the influence model. We show first the expressiveness of influence games showing that they capture the class of simple games. Then we characterize the computational complexity of various problems on influence games, including measures (length and width), values (Shapley-Shubik and Banzhaf) and properties (of teams and players). Finally, we analyze those problems for some particular extremal cases, with respect to the propagation of influence, showing tighter complexity characterizations.",12,[],7

Current systems are coarse-grained and provide consumers very little actual control over their data. Herein, we propose an alternative system for managing the use of healthcare information. This novel system is finer grained, allows for data mining and repackaging, and gives users more control over their data, allowing it to be distributed to their specifications. In this paper, we outline the characteristics of such a system in different contexts, present relevant background information and research leading to the system design, and cover specific usage scenarios supported by this system that are difficult to control using simpler access control strategies.",12,[],7
1205.0668,cs,"Using the CD-ROM version of the Science Citation Index 2010 (N = 3,705 journals), we study the (combined) effects of (i) fractional counting on the impact factor (IF) and (ii) transformation of the skewed citation distributions into a distribution of 100 percentiles and six percentile rank classes (top-1%, top-5%, etc.). Do these approaches lead to field-normalized impact measures for journals? In addition to the two-year IF (IF2), we consider the five-year IF (IF5), the respective numerators of these IFs, and the number of Total Cites, counted both as integers and fractionally. These various indicators are tested against the hypothesis that the classification of journals into 11 broad fields by PatentBoard/National Science Foundation provides statistically significant between-field effects. Using fractional counting the between-field variance is reduced by 91.7% in the case of IF5, and by 79.2% in the case of IF2. However, the differences in citation counts are not significantly affected by fractional counting. These results accord with previous studies, but the longer citation window of a fractionally counted IF5 can lead to significant improvement in the normalization across fields.",12,[],7

The new automata recognize languages of data words (instead of normal words), which beside each its letter from a finite alphabet have a data value from an infinite alphabet. Those data values can be loaded to the stack of the automaton, and later compared with some farther data values on the input. Our main purpose for introducing these automata is that they may help in analyzing normal automata (without data). As an example, we give a proof that deterministic automata with collapse can recognize more languages than deterministic automata without collapse. This proof is simpler than in the no-data case. We also state a hypothesis how the new automaton model can be related to the original model of higher-order pushdown automata.",12,[],7
1201.6282,cs,"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is a multi-user version of the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmission technique, which divides a wideband channel into a number of orthogonal narrowband subchannels, called subcarriers. An OFDMA system takes advantage of both frequency diversity (FD) gain and frequency-selective scheduling (FSS) gain. A FD gain is achieved by allocating a user the subcarriers distributed over the entire frequency band whereas a FSS gain is achieved by allocating a user adjacent subcarriers located within a subband of a small bandwidth having the most favorable channel conditions among other subbands in the entire frequency band. Multi-User Multiple Input Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) is a promising technology to increase spectral efficiency. A well-known MU-MIMO mode is Space-Division Multiple Access (SDMA) which can be used in the downlink direction to allow a group of spatially separable users to share the same time/frequency resources. In this paper, we study the gain from FSS in SDMA-OFDMA systems using the example of WiMAX. Therefore, a complete SDMA-OFDMA MAC scheduling solution supporting both FD and FSS is proposed. The proposed solution is analyzed in a typical urban macro-cell scenario by means of system-level packet-based simulations, with detailed MAC and physical layer abstractions. By explicitly simulating the MAC layer overhead (MAP) which is required to signal every packed data burst in the OFDMA frame we can present the overall performance to be expected at the MAC layer. Our results show that in general the gain from FSS when applying SDMA is low. However, under specific conditions, small number of BS antennas or large channel bandwidth, a significant gain can be achieved from FSS.",12,[],7
1207.6732,cs,"In the advent of large-scale multi-hop wireless technologies, such as MANET, VANET, iThings, it is of utmost importance to devise efficient distributed protocols to maintain network architecture and provide basic communication tools. One of such fundamental communication tasks is broadcast, also known as a 1-to-all communication. We propose several new efficient distributed algorithms and evaluate their time performance both theoretically and by simulations. First randomized algorithm accomplishes broadcast in O(Dlog(1/d)) rounds with probability at least 1-d on any uniform-power network of n nodes and diameter D, when equipped with local estimate of network density. Additionally, we evaluate average performance of this protocols by simulations on two classes of generated networks - uniform and social - and compare the results with performance of exponential backoff heuristic. Ours is the first provably efficient and well-scalable distributed solution for the (global) broadcast task. The second randomized protocol developed in this paper does not rely on the estimate of local density, and achieves only slightly higher time performance O((Dlog(1/d))log n). Finally, we provide a deterministic algorithm achieving similar time O(D log2 n), supported by theoretical analysis.",12,[],7
1207.4167,cs,"Modeling dynamical systems, both for control purposes and to make predictions about their behavior, is ubiquitous in science and engineering. Predictive state representations (PSRs) are a recently introduced class of models for discrete-time dynamical systems. The key idea behind PSRs and the closely related OOMs (Jaeger's observable operator models) is to represent the state of the system as a set of predictions of observable outcomes of experiments one can do in the system. This makes PSRs rather different from history-based models such as nth-order Markov models and hidden-state-based models such as HMMs and POMDPs. We introduce an interesting construct, the systemdynamics matrix, and show how PSRs can be derived simply from it. We also use this construct to show formally that PSRs are more general than both nth-order Markov models and HMMs/POMDPs. Finally, we discuss the main difference between PSRs and OOMs and conclude with directions for future work.",12,[],7

1209.3253,cs,"In this paper we present a generic framework for the asymptotic performance analysis of subspace-based parameter estimation schemes. It is based on earlier results on an explicit first-order expansion of the estimation error in the signal subspace obtained via an SVD of the noisy observation matrix. We extend these results in a number of aspects. Firstly, we derive an explicit first-order expansion of the Higher- Order SVD (HOSVD)-based subspace estimate. Secondly, we show how to obtain explicit first-order expansions of the estimation error of ESPRIT-type algorithms and provide the expressions for matrix-based and tensor-based Standard ESPRIT and Unitary ESPRIT. Thirdly, we derive closed-form expressions for the mean square error (MSE) and show that they only depend on the second-order moments of the noise. Hence, we only need the noise to be zero mean and possess finite second order moments. Fourthly, we investigate the effect of using Structured Least Squares (SLS) to solve the overdetermined shift invariance equations in ESPRIT and provide an explicit first-order expansion as well as a closed-form MSE expression. Finally, we simplify the MSE for the special case of a single source and compute the asymptotic efficiency of the investigated ESPRIT-type algorithms in compact closed-form expressions which only depend on the array size and the effective SNR. Our results are more general than existing results on the performance analysis of ESPRIT-type algorithms since (a) we do not need any assumptions about the noise except for the mean to be zero and the second-order moments to be finite (in contrast to earlier results that require Gaussianity or second-order circular symmetry); (b) our results are asymptotic in the effective SNR, i.e., we do not require the number of samples to be large; (c) we present a framework that incorporates various ESPRIT-type algorithms in one unified manner.",12,[],7
1201.4899,cs,"A central problem in e-commerce is determining overlapping communities among individuals or objects in the absence of external identification or tagging. We address this problem by introducing a framework that captures the notion of communities or clusters determined by the relative affinities among their members. To this end we define what we call an affinity system, which is a set of elements, each with a vector characterizing its preference for all other elements in the set. We define a natural notion of (potentially overlapping) communities in an affinity system, in which the members of a given community collectively prefer each other to anyone else outside the community. Thus these communities are endogenously formed in the affinity system and are ""self-determined"" or ""self-certified"" by its members.   We provide a tight polynomial bound on the number of self-determined communities as a function of the robustness of the community. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for enumerating these communities. Moreover, we obtain a local algorithm with a strong stochastic performance guarantee that can find a community in time nearly linear in the of size the community.   Social networks fit particularly naturally within the affinity system framework -- if we can appropriately extract the affinities from the relatively sparse yet rich information from social networks, our analysis then yields a set of efficient algorithms for enumerating self-determined communities in social networks. In the context of social networks we also connect our analysis with results about equation-clusters introduced by Mishra, Schreiber, Stanton, and Tarjan \citemsst. In contrast with the polynomial bound we prove on the number of communities in the affinity system model, we show that there exists a family of networks with superpolynomial number of equation-clusters.",12,[],7

1211.3233,cs,"In this study, we consider the use of seismic sensors for footstep localization in indoor environments. A popular strategy of localization is to use the measured differences in arrival times of source signals at multiple pairs of receivers. In the literature, most algorithms that are based on time differences of arrival (TDOA) assume that the propagation velocity is a constant as a function of the source position, which is valid for air propagation or even for narrow band signals. However a bounded medium such as a concrete slab (encountered in indoor environement) is usually dispersive and damped. In this study, we demonstrate that under such conditions, the concrete slab can be assimilated to a thin plate; considering a Kelvin-Voigt damping model, we introduce the notion of \em perceived propagation velocity, which decreases when the source-sensor distance increases. This peculiar behaviour precludes any possibility to rely on existing localization methods in indoor environment. Therefore, a new localization algorithm that is adapted to a damped and dispersive medium is proposed, using only on the sign of the measured TDOA (SO-TDOA). A simulation and some experimental results are included, to define the performance of this SO-TDOA algorithm.",12,[],7

They describe a wide range of scenarios but make the restrictive assumption that the goal is reachable from any state, i.e., that dead-end states do not exist. Because of this, SSPs are unable to model various scenarios that may have catastrophic events (e.g., an airplane possibly crashing if it flies into a storm). Even though MDP algorithms have been used for solving problems with dead ends, a principled theory of SSP extensions that would allow dead ends, including theoretically sound algorithms for solving such MDPs, has been lacking. In this paper, we propose three new MDP classes that admit dead ends under increasingly weaker assumptions.

1206.5941,cs,"We introduce the cross-composition framework for proving kernelization lower bounds. A classical problem L AND/OR-cross-composes into a parameterized problem Q if it is possible to efficiently construct an instance of Q with polynomially bounded parameter value that expresses the logical AND or OR of a sequence of instances of L. Building on work by Bodlaender et al. (ICALP 2008) and using a result by Fortnow and Santhanam (STOC 2008) with a refinement by Dell and van Melkebeek (STOC 2010), we show that if an NP-hard problem OR-cross-composes into a parameterized problem Q then Q does not admit a polynomial kernel unless NP \subseteq coNP/poly and the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Similarly, an AND-cross-composition for Q rules out polynomial kernels for Q under Bodlaender et al.'s AND-distillation conjecture.   Our technique generalizes and strengthens the recent techniques of using composition algorithms and of transferring the lower bounds via polynomial parameter transformations. We show its applicability by proving kernelization lower bounds for a number of important graphs problems with structural (non-standard) parameterizations, e.g., Clique, Chromatic Number, Weighted Feedback Vertex Set, and Weighted Odd Cycle Transversal do not admit polynomial kernels with respect to the vertex cover number of the input graphs unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses, contrasting the fact that these problems are trivially fixed-parameter tractable for this parameter.   After learning of our results, several teams of authors have successfully applied the cross-composition framework to different parameterized problems. For completeness, our presentation of the framework includes several extensions based on this follow-up work. For example, we show how a relaxed version of OR-cross-compositions may be used to give lower bounds on the degree of the polynomial in the kernel size.",12,[],7
1203.2393,cs,"Accurate estimation of licensed channel Primary User's (PU) temporal statistics is important for Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) systems. With accurate estimation of the mean duty cycle, u, and the mean off- and on-times of PUs, DSA systems can more efficiently assign PU resources to its subscribers, thus, increasing channel utilization. This paper presents a mathematical analysis of the accuracy of estimating u, as well as the PU mean off- and on-times, where the estimation accuracy is expressed as the mean squared estimation error. The analysis applies for the traffic model assuming exponentially distributed PU off- and on-times, which is a common model in traffic literature. The estimation accuracy is quantified as a function of the number of samples and observation window length, hence, this work provides guidelines on traffic parameters estimation for both energy-constrained and delay-constrained applications. For estimating u, we consider uniform, non-uniform, and weighted sample stream averaging, as well as maximum likelihood estimation. The estimation accuracy of the mean PU off- and on-times is studied when maximum likelihood estimation is employed. Furthermore, we develop algorithms for the blind estimation of the traffic parameters based on the derived theoretical estimation accuracy expressions. We show that the estimation error for all traffic parameters is lower bounded for a fixed observation window length due to the correlation between the traffic samples. Moreover, we prove that for estimating u, maximum likelihood estimation can yield the same estimation error as weighted sample averaging using only half the observation window length.",12,[],7

Resolving this question is known to require non-black-box techniques.   We consider non-black-box techniques for zero-knowledge based on knowledge assumptions, a line of thinking initiated by the work of Hada and Tanaka (CRYPTO 1998). Prior to our work, it was not known whether knowledge assumptions could be used for achieving security in the concurrent setting, due to a number of significant limitations that we discuss here. Nevertheless, we obtain the following results:   1. We obtain the first constant round concurrent zero-knowledge argument for \textbfNP in the plain model based on a new variant of knowledge of exponent assumption. Furthermore, our construction avoids the inefficiency inherent in previous non-black-box techniques such that those of Barak (FOCS 2001); we obtain our result through an efficient protocol compiler.   2. Unlike Hada and Tanaka, we do not require a knowledge assumption to argue the soundness of our protocol. Instead, we use a discrete log like assumption, which we call Diffie-Hellman Logarithm Assumption, to prove the soundness of our protocol.   3. We give evidence that our new variant of knowledge of exponent assumption is in fact plausible. In particular, we show that our assumption holds in the generic group model.   4.

Our features include both the original driver factors as well as some derived features. We evaluated our features on the imbalance corrected dataset, i.e. under-sampled dataset and compare a large number of existing machine learning tools, especially decision tree-based classifiers, for predicting the churners and win-backs. In general, we find RandomForest and SimpleCart learning algorithms generally perform well and tend to provide us with highly competitive prediction performance. Among the top-15 driver factors that signal the churn behavior, we find that the service utilization, e.g. last two months' download and upload volume, last three months' average upload and download, and the payment related factors are the most indicative features for predicting if churn will happen soon. Such features can collectively tell discrepancies between the service plans, payments and the dynamically changing utilization needs of the customers.

1207.6630,cs,"A fundamental problem in the delay and backlog analysis across multi-hop paths in wireless networks is how to account for the random properties of the wireless channel. Since the usual statistical models for radio signals in a propagation environment do not lend themselves easily to a description of the available service rate on a wireless link, the performance analysis of wireless networks has resorted to higher-layer abstractions, e.g., using Markov chain models. In this work, we propose a network calculus that can incorporate common statistical models of fading channels and obtain statistical bounds on delay and backlog across multiple nodes. We conduct the analysis in a transfer domain, which we refer to as the `SNR domain', where the service process at a link is characterized by the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver. We discover that, in the transfer domain, the network model is governed by a dioid algebra, which we refer to as (min,x)-algebra. Using this algebra we derive the desired delay and backlog bounds.

To avoid these limitations, we introduce a new methodology for constructing classification systems at the level of individual publications. In the proposed methodology, publications are clustered into research areas based on citation relations. The methodology is able to deal with very large numbers of publications. We present an application in which a classification system is produced that includes almost ten million publications. Based on an extensive analysis of this classification system, we discuss the strengths and the limitations of the proposed methodology. Important strengths are the transparency and relative simplicity of the methodology and its fairly modest computing and memory requirements.

1208.2478,cs,"Recent work in commerce search has shown that understanding the semantics in user queries enables more effective query analysis and retrieval of relevant products. However, due to lack of sufficient domain knowledge, user queries often include terms that cannot be mapped directly to any product attribute. For example, a user looking for \tt designer handbags might start with such a query because she is not familiar with the manufacturers, the price ranges, and/or the material that gives a handbag designer appeal. Current commerce search engines treat terms such as \tt designer as keywords and attempt to match them to contents such as product reviews and product descriptions, often resulting in poor user experience.   In this study, we propose to address this problem by reformulating queries involving terms such as \tt designer, which we call \emphmodifiers, to queries that specify precise product attributes. We learn to rewrite the modifiers to attribute values by analyzing user behavior and leveraging structured data sources such as the product catalog that serves the queries. We first produce a probabilistic mapping between the modifiers and attribute values based on user behavioral data.

1208.4877,cs,"Access control to data in traditional enterprises is typically enforced through reference monitors. However, as more and more enterprise data is outsourced, trusting third party storage servers is getting challenging. As a result, cryptography, specifically Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is getting popular for its expressiveness. The challenge of ABE is revocation.   To address this challenge, we propose PIRATTE, an architecture that supports fine-grained access control policies and dynamic group membership. PIRATTE is built using attribute-based encryption; a key and novel feature of our architecture, however, is that it is possible to remove access from a user without issuing new keys to other users or re-encrypting existing ciphertexts. We achieve this by introducing a proxy that participates in the decryption process and enforces revocation constraints. The proxy is minimally trusted and cannot decrypt ciphertexts or provide access to previously revoked users. We describe the PIRATTE construction and provide a security analysis along with performance evaluation.We also describe an architecture for online social network that can use PIRATTE, and prototype application of PIRATTE on Facebook.",12,[],7

1204.2718,cs,"Novel research in the field of Linked Data focuses on the problem of entity summarization. This field addresses the problem of ranking features according to their importance for the task of identifying a particular entity. Next to a more human friendly presentation, these summarizations can play a central role for semantic search engines and semantic recommender systems. In current approaches, it has been tried to apply entity summarization based on patterns that are inherent to the regarded data.   The proposed approach of this paper focuses on the movie domain. It utilizes usage data in order to support measuring the similarity between movie entities. Using this similarity it is possible to determine the k-nearest neighbors of an entity. This leads to the idea that features that entities share with their nearest neighbors can be considered as significant or important for these entities. Additionally, we introduce a downgrading factor (similar to TF-IDF) in order to overcome the high number of commonly occurring features. We exemplify the approach based on a movie-ratings dataset that has been linked to Freebase entities.",12,[],7
1206.6426,cs,"In spite of their superior performance, neural probabilistic language models (NPLMs) remain far less widely used than n-gram models due to their notoriously long training times, which are measured in weeks even for moderately-sized datasets. Training NPLMs is computationally expensive because they are explicitly normalized, which leads to having to consider all words in the vocabulary when computing the log-likelihood gradients.   We propose a fast and simple algorithm for training NPLMs based on noise-contrastive estimation, a newly introduced procedure for estimating unnormalized continuous distributions. We investigate the behaviour of the algorithm on the Penn Treebank corpus and show that it reduces the training times by more than an order of magnitude without affecting the quality of the resulting models. The algorithm is also more efficient and much more stable than importance sampling because it requires far fewer noise samples to perform well.

It seems therefore advisable to use machine-learning algorithms to create the rules automatically or semi-automatically. The results obtained seem to corroborate my initial hypothesis that symbolic machine learning algorithms can be useful for acquiring new rules for grammar checking. It turns out, however, that for practical uses, error corpora cannot be the sole source of information used in grammar checking. I suggest therefore that only by using different approaches, grammar-checkers, or more generally, computer-aided proofreading tools, will be able to cover most frequent and severe mistakes and avoid false alarms that seem to distract users.",12,[],7

In this paper, we also model the mind as a place where a circuit grows, starting as a collection of primitive components at birth and then builds up incrementally in a bottom up fashion. A new node is formed by a simple composition of prior nodes when we undergo a repeated experience that can be described by that composition.

1203.4698,cs,"The Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are composed of resource starved sensor nodes that are deployed to sense, process and communicate vital information to the base station. Due to the stringent constraints on the resources in the sensor nodes on one hand and due to the communications costs being always significantly higher than the data processing costs, the WSNs typically, employ in-network processing, which aims at reducing effectively, the total number of packets eventually transmitted to the base station. Such innetwork processing largely employs data aggregation operations that aggregate the data into a compact representation for further transmission. However, due to the ubiquitous & pervasive deployment, heavier resource demands of the security protocols and due to the stringent resource constraints in WSN nodes, the security concerns in WSNs are even otherwise critical. These concerns assume alarming proportions when using data aggregation in which the output of the data aggregator nodes depends on that of various other nodes.

1208.6057,cs,"Objective: Spinal cord injury (SCI) often leaves affected individuals unable to ambulate. Electroencephalogramme (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) controlled lower extremity prostheses may restore intuitive and able-body-like ambulation after SCI. To test its feasibility, the authors developed and tested a novel EEG-based, data-driven BCI system for intuitive and self-paced control of the ambulation of an avatar within a virtual reality environment (VRE).   Approach: Eight able-bodied subjects and one with SCI underwent the following 10-min training session: subjects alternated between idling and walking kinaesthetic motor imageries (KMI) while their EEG were recorded and analysed to generate subject-specific decoding models. Subjects then performed a goal-oriented online task, repeated over 5 sessions, in which they utilised the KMI to control the linear ambulation of an avatar and make 10 sequential stops at designated points within the VRE.   Main results: The average offline training performance across subjects was 77.2 /- 9.5%, ranging from 64.3% (p = 0.00176) to 94.5% (p = 6.26*10-23), with chance performance being 50%. The average online performance was 8.4 /- 1.0 (out of 10) successful stops and 303 /- 53 sec completion time (perfect = 211 sec). All subjects achieved performances significantly different than those of random walk (p < 0.05) in 44 of the 45 online sessions.   Significance: By using a data-driven machine learning approach to decode users' KMI, this BCIVRE system enabled intuitive and purposeful self-paced control of ambulation after only a 10-minute training. The ability to achieve such BCI control with minimal training indicates that the implementation of future BCI-lower extremity prosthesis systems may be feasible.",12,[],7

1210.1649,cs,"Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a well-known problem solving approach based on nonmonotonic logic programs and efficient solvers. To enable access to external information, HEX-programs extend programs with external atoms, which allow for a bidirectional communication between the logic program and external sources of computation (e.g., description logic reasoners and Web resources). Current solvers evaluate HEX-programs by a translation to ASP itself, in which values of external atoms are guessed and verified after the ordinary answer set computation. This elegant approach does not scale with the number of external accesses in general, in particular in presence of nondeterminism (which is instrumental for ASP). In this paper, we present a novel, native algorithm for evaluating HEX-programs which uses learning techniques. In particular, we extend conflict-driven ASP solving techniques, which prevent the solver from running into the same conflict again, from ordinary to HEX-programs. We show how to gain additional knowledge from external source evaluations and how to use it in a conflict-driven algorithm. We first target the uninformed case, i.e., when we have no extra information on external sources, and then extend our approach to the case where additional meta-information is available. Experiments show that learning from external sources can significantly decrease both the runtime and the number of considered candidate compatible sets.",12,[],7

This operation is applied to punctured versions of this square code obtained by picking a subset   equation of the whole set of columns.

1209.2376,cs,"Two way buffer system is a system that exhibits transfer of data using two buffers concurrently. It includes processes that synchronize to exchange data with each other along with executing certain delays between these synchronizations. In existing Tiny Two Way Buffer System, both generators produce packets in half duplex manner in no time, deterministic time, and non deterministic time. Analysis of the model for above time options leads the model in deadlock. The model can be out of the deadlock if timings in the model is incorporated in alternative fashion. The generators produce packets after a delay of 10 seconds. However, generator one has an initial shift of 5 seconds after which it begins sending a packet every 10 seconds. Hence, initial delay for generator one is 15 seconds and for generator two it is 10 seconds. Due to this initial shift, both generators produce packets alternatively and is deadlock free as the packets do not meet at the same time instant. Moreover, the existing system model is not concurrent and hence takes more time for packet transfer in every iteration. In this paper we have proposed a model of buffer system using an additional dummy buffer for transfer of data packets, we thus checking the model with various time models as no time, deterministic time and non deterministic time. The results of proposed model under above time models are in deadlock. We achieve deadlock free situation by introducing appropriate delay in various buffers of the proposed system, the delay timing is nondeterministic time. The new approach speeds up the transfer of packets, as a result the transfer of data becomes concurrent, deadlock free and hence the model proposed is time efficient. Simulation results shows that the proposed two way buffer system is fully concurrent and time efficient as compared to the existing buffer system.",12,[],7
1204.4111,cs,"In resource buying games a set of players jointly buys a subset of a finite resource set E (e.g., machines, edges, or nodes in a digraph). The cost of a resource e depends on the number (or load) of players using e, and has to be paid completely by the players before it becomes available. Each player i needs at least one set of a predefined family Si in 2E to be available. Thus, resource buying games can be seen as a variant of congestion games in which the load-dependent costs of the resources can be shared arbitrarily among the players. A strategy of player i in resource buying games is a tuple consisting of one of i's desired configurations Si together with a payment vector pi in RE indicating how much i is willing to contribute towards the purchase of the chosen resources. In this paper, we study the existence and computational complexity of pure Nash equilibria (PNE, for short) of resource buying games. In contrast to classical congestion games for which equilibria are guaranteed to exist, the existence of equilibria in resource buying games strongly depends on the underlying structure of the Si's and the behavior of the cost functions.

We analyse the examples provided by Friedmann in terms of complexity measures for directed graphs such as treewidth, DAG-width, Kelly-width, entanglement, directed pathwidth, and cliquewidth. It is known that for every class of parity games on which one of these parameters is bounded, the winning regions can be efficiently computed. It turns out that with respect to almost all of these measures, the complexity of Friedmann's counterexamples is bounded, and indeed in most cases by very small numbers. This analysis strengthens in some sense Friedmann's results and shows that the discrete strategy improvement algorithm is even more limited than one might have thought. Not only does it require super-polynomial running time in the general case, where the problem of polynomial-time solvability is open, it even has super-polynomial lower time bounds on natural classes of parity games on which efficient algorithms are known.",12,[],7
1211.1056,cs,"Linear sketches are powerful algorithmic tools that turn an n-dimensional input into a concise lower-dimensional representation via a linear transformation. Such sketches have seen a wide range of applications including norm estimation over data streams, compressed sensing, and distributed computing. In almost any realistic setting, however, a linear sketch faces the possibility that its inputs are correlated with previous evaluations of the sketch. Known techniques no longer guarantee the correctness of the output in the presence of such correlations. We therefore ask: Are linear sketches inherently non-robust to adaptively chosen inputs? We give a strong affirmative answer to this question. Specifically, we show that no linear sketch approximates the Euclidean norm of its input to within an arbitrary multiplicative approximation factor on a polynomial number of adaptively chosen inputs. The result remains true even if the dimension of the sketch is d = n - o(n) and the sketch is given unbounded computation time. Our result is based on an algorithm with running time polynomial in d that adaptively finds a distribution over inputs on which the sketch is incorrect with constant probability. Our result implies several corollaries for related problems including lp-norm estimation and compressed sensing. Notably, we resolve an open problem in compressed sensing regarding the feasibility of l2/l2-recovery guarantees in the presence of computationally bounded adversaries.",12,[],7

1207.2604,cs,"In duty-cycled wireless sensor networks, deployed sensor nodes are usually put to sleep for energy efficiency according to sleep scheduling approaches. Any sleep scheduling scheme with its supporting protocols ensures that data can always be routed from source to sink. In this paper, we investigate a problem of multi-hop broadcast and routing in random sleep scheduling scheme, and propose a novel protocol, called DQSB, by quasi-synchronization mechanism to achieve reliable broadcast and less latency routing. DQSB neither assumes time synchronization which requires all neighboring nodes wake up at the same time, nor assumes duty-cycled awareness which makes it difficult to use in asynchronous WSNs. Furthermore, the benefit of quasi-synchronized mechanism for broadcast from sink to other nodes is the less latency routing paths for reverse data collection to sink because of no or less sleep waiting time. Simulation results show that DQSB outperforms the existing protocols in broadcast times performance and keeps relative tolerant broadcast latency performance, even in the case of unreliable links. The proposed DQSB protocol, in this paper, can be recognized as a tradeoff between broadcast times and broadcast latency.

We parameterize the belief distribution as a Gaussian mixture, and use the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to approximate the belief update. Since the EKF is a first-order filter, we can marginalize over the observations analytically. By using feedback control and state estimation during policy execution, we recover a behavior that is effectively conditioned on incoming observations despite the unconditioned planning. Local optimization provides no guarantees of global optimality, but it allows us to tackle domains that are at least an order of magnitude larger than the current state-of-the-art.

1207.5601,gr-qc,"We offer a new, physically transparent argument for the existence of the critical, universal maximum matter density in loop quantum cosmology for the case of a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmology with scalar matter. The argument is based on the existence of a sharp exponential ultraviolet cutoff in momentum space on the eigenfunctions of the quantum cosmological dynamical evolution operator (the gravitational part of the Hamiltonian constraint), attributable to the fundamental discreteness of spatial volume in loop quantum cosmology. The existence of the cutoff is proved directly from recently found exact solutions for the eigenfunctions for this model. As a consequence, the operators corresponding to the momentum of the scalar field and the spatial volume approximately commute. The ultraviolet cutoff then implies that the scalar momentum, though not a bounded operator, is in effect bounded on subspaces of constant volume, leading to the upper bound on the expectation value of the matter density. The maximum matter density is universal (i.e. independent of the quantum state) because of the linear scaling of the cutoff with volume. These heuristic arguments are supplemented by a new proof in the volume representation of the existence of the maximum matter density. The techniques employed to demonstrate the existence of the cutoff also allow us to extract the large volume limit of the exact eigenfunctions, confirming earlier numerical and analytical work showing that the eigenfunctions approach superpositions of the eigenfunctions of the Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of the same model.

The horizon fluxes from perturbative simulations and the EOB-resummed expression agree at the level of a few percent down to the late plunge. An upgrade of the EOB model for nonspinning binaries that includes horizon absorption of angular momentum as an additional term in the resummed radiation reaction is then discussed. The effect of this term on the waveform phasing for binaries with mass ratios spanning 1 to 1000 is investigated. We confirm that for comparable and intermediate-mass-ratio binaries horizon absorbtion is practically negligible for detection with advanced LIGO and the Einstein Telescope (faithfulness greater than or equal to 0.997).",12,[],13
1207.7263,gr-qc,"Within the context of the Ashtekar variables, the Hamiltonian constraint of four-dimensional pure General Relativity with cosmological constant, equation, is reexpressed as an affine algebra with the commutator of the imaginary part of the Chern-Simons functional, equation, and the positive-definite volume element. This demonstrates that the affine algebra quantization program of Klauder can indeed be applicable to the full Lorentzian signature theory of quantum gravity with non-vanishing cosmological constant; and it facilitates the construction of solutions to all of the constraints. Unitary, irreducible representations of the affine group exhibit a natural Hilbert space structure, and coherent states and other physical states can be generated from a fiducial state. It is also intriguing that formulation of the Hamiltonian constraint or Wheeler-DeWitt equation as an affine algebra requires a non-vanishing cosmological constant; and a fundamental uncertainty relation of the form equation (wherein equation is the total volume) may apply to all physical states of quantum gravity.",12,[],13

1207.5167,gr-qc,"In numerical simulations of black hole binaries, Pretorius and Khurana [Class. Quant. Grav. \bf 24, S83 (2007)] have observed critical behaviour at the threshold between scattering and immediate merger. The number of orbits scales as equation along any one-parameter family of initial data such that the threshold is at equation. Hence they conjecture that in ultrarelavistic collisions almost all the kinetic energy can be converted into gravitational waves if the impact parameter is fine-tuned to the threshold. As a toy model for the binary, they consider the geodesic motion of a test particle in a Kerr black hole spacetime, where the unstable circular geodesics play the role of critical solutions, and calculate the critical exponent equation. Here, we incorporate radiation reaction into this model using the self-force approximation. The critical solution now evolves adiabatically along a sequence of unstable circular geodesic orbits under the effect of the self-force. We confirm that almost all the initial energy and angular momentum are radiated on the critical solution. Our calculation suggests that, even for infinite initial energy, this happens over a finite number of orbits given by equation, where equation is the (small) mass ratio. We derive expressions for the time spent on the critical solution, number of orbits and radiated energy as functions of the initial energy and impact parameter.",12,[],13

1201.4400,gr-qc,"Broadband noise in gravitational wave (GW) detectors, also known as triggers, can often be a deterrant to the efficiency with which astrophysical search pipelines detect sources. It is important to understand their instrumental or environmental origin so that they could be eliminated or accounted for in the data. Since the number of triggers is large, data mining approaches such as clustering and classification are useful tools for this task. Classification of triggers based on a handful of discrete properties has been done in the past. A rich information content is available in the waveform or 'shape' of the triggers that has had a rather restricted exploration so far. This paper presents a new way to classify triggers deriving information from both trigger waveforms as well as their discrete physical properties using a sequential combination of the Longest Common Sub-Sequence (LCSS) and LCSS coupled with Fast Time Series Evaluation (FTSE) for waveform classification and the multidimensional hierarchical classification (MHC) analysis for the grouping based on physical properties. A generalized k-means algorithm is used with the LCSS (and LCSSFTSE) for clustering the triggers using a validity measure to determine the correct number of clusters in absence of any prior knowledge. The results have been demonstrated by simulations and by application to a segment of real LIGO data from the sixth science run.",12,[],13
1201.5806,gr-qc,"This is the second of the two related papers analysing origins and possible explanations of a paradoxical phenomenon of the quantum potential (QP). It arises in quantum mechanics'(QM) of a particle in the Riemannian equation-dimensional configurational space obtained by various procedures of quantization of the non-relativistic natural Hamilton systems. Now, the two questions are investigated: 1)Does QP appear in the non-relativistic QM generated by the quantum theory of scalar field (QFT) non-minimally coupled to the space-time metric? 2)To which extent is it in accord with quantization of the natural systems? To this end, the asymptotic non-relativistic equation for the particle-interpretable wave functions and operators of canonical observables are obtained from the primary QFT objects. It is shown that, in the globally-static space-time, the Hamilton operators coincide at the origin of the quasi-Euclidean space coordinates in the both altenative approaches for any constant of non-minimality equation, but a certain requirement of the Principle of Equivalence to the quantum field propagator distinguishes the unique value equation. Just the same value had the constant equation in the quantum Hamiltonians arising from the traditional quantizations of the natural systems: the DeWitt canonical, Pauli-DeWitt quasiclassical, geometrical and Feynman ones, as well as in the revised Schrodinger variational quantization. Thus, QP generated by mechanics is tightly related to non-minimality of the quantum scalar field. Meanwhile, an essential discrepancy exists between the non-relativistic QMs derived from the two altenative approaches: QFT generate a scalar QP, whereas various quantizations of natural mechanics, lead to PQs depending on choice of space coordinates as physical observables and non-vanishing even in the flat space if the coordinates are curvilinear.",12,[],13
1203.5709,gr-qc,"The primary aim of this paper is to provide a simple and concrete interpretation of Cartan geometry in terms of the mathematics of idealized waywisers. Waywisers, also called hodometers, are instruments traditionally used to measure distances. The mathematical representation of an idealized waywiser consists of a choice of symmetric space called a \em model space and represents the `wheel' of the idealized waywiser. The geometry of a manifold is then completely characterized by a pair of variables equation, each of which admit simple interpretations: equation is the point of contact between the waywiser's idealized wheel and the manifold whose geometry one wishes to characterize, and equation is a connection one-form dictating how much the idealized wheel of the waywiser has rotated when rolled along the manifold. The familiar objects from differential geometry (e.g. metric equation, affine connection equation, co-tetrad equation, torsion equation, spin-connection equation, Riemannian curvature equation) can be seen as compound objects made out of the waywiser variables equation. We then generalize this waywiser approach to relativistic spacetimes and exhibit action principles for General Relativity in terms of the waywiser variables for two choices of model spacetimes: De Sitter and anti-De Sitter spacetimes.",12,[],13

When the curvature is sufficiently large the additional higher order terms, affect the evolution of the whole system. Since high curvature characterizes the region when the critical behavior takes place this critical behavior is destroyed. Both the self similarity and the mass scaling relation disappear. Instead we find a different behavior near the black hole threshold, which depends on the coupling constant of the higher order terms.

The acceleration and angular velocity can be chosen either aligned or perpendicular, and in the latter case the angular velocity can be chosen equal or smaller than than the acceleration. We start reviewing the classical Euler's and Chasles' theorems both in the Lie algebra and group versions. We recall the relativistic generalization of Euler's theorem and observe that every (infinitesimal) transformation can be recovered from information of algebraic and geometric type, the former being identified with the conjugacy class and the latter with some additional geometric ingredients (the screw axis in the usual non-relativistic version). Then the proper orthochronous inhomogeneous Lorentz Lie group is studied in detail. We prove its exponentiality and identify a causal semigroup and the corresponding Lie cone. Through the identification of new Ad-invariants we classify the conjugacy classes, and show that those which admit a causal representative have special physical significance.

For a equation cold-atom BEC with a particle density equation we find a fractional shift of order equation, but this can be much larger for even more dilute BECs. We discuss the possibility of planning specific experiments with BECs that might provide phenomenological constraints on Planck-scale physics.

1201.5244,gr-qc,"Continuous gravitational waves (CW) are expected from spinning neutron stars with non-axisymmetric deformations. A network of interferometric detectors (LIGO, Virgo and GEO600) is looking for these signals. They are predicted to be very weak and retrievable only by integration over long observation times. One of the standard methods of CW data analysis is the multi-detector F-statistic. In a typical search, the F-statistic is computed over a range in frequency, spin-down and sky position, and the candidates with highest F values are kept for further analysis. However, this detection statistic is susceptible to a class of noise artifacts, strong monochromatic lines in a single detector. By assuming an extended noise model - standard Gaussian noise plus single-detector lines - we can use a Bayesian odds ratio to derive a generalized detection statistic, the line veto (LV-) statistic. In the absence of lines, it behaves similarly to the F-statistic, but it is more robust against line artifacts. In the past, ad-hoc post-processing vetoes have been implemented in searches to remove these artifacts. Here we provide a systematic framework to develop and benchmark this class of vetoes.

The historically established but causally unsatisfactory solution to this problem due to Eckart is shown to be based on an ansatz that is interpretable as postulating a most unnatural relation between the (particle and entropy) velocities and their associated momenta, which accounts for the well known bad behaviour of that model which has recently been shown to have very pathological mixed-elliptic-hyperbolic comportments. The newer (and more elegant) solution of Landau and Lifshitz has a more mathematically respectable parabolic-hyperbolic comportment, but is still compatible with a well posed initial value problem only in such a restricted limit-case such as that of linearised perturbations of a static background. For mathematically acceptable behaviour undermore general circumstances, and a fortiori for the physically motivated requirement of subluminal signal propagation, only strictly hyperbolic behaviour is acceptable. Attention is drawn here to the availability of a more modern ""regular"" solution which, is fully satisfactory as far as all these requirements are concerned.

Such a drift would be possible to measure using devices that are under construction; the required time of monitoring would be equation years. This effect is zero in the FLRW models, so it provides a measure of inhomogeneity of the Universe. In the Szekeres models, the condition for zero drift is zero shear.

We exclude, at the 95% C.L., two regions: 100<mH<106 GeV/c2, and 147<mH<179 GeV/c2. We expect to exclude the regions 100<mH<119 GeV/c2 and 141<mH<184 GeV/c2. There is an excess of data events with respect to the background estimation in the mass range 115<mH<135 GeV/c2 which causes our limits to not be as stringent as expected. At mH=120 GeV/c2, the p-value for a background fluctuation to produce this excess is ~3.5 x 10-3, corresponding to a local significance of 2.7 standard deviations. The global significance for such an excess anywhere in the full mass range is approximately 2.2 standard deviations. We also combine separately searches for H->bbbar and H->WW-, and find that the excess is concentrated in the H->bbbar channel, although the results in the H->WW- channel are also consistent with the possible presence of a low-mass Higgs boson.",12,[],12

Primary channels rely on the associate production with a vector boson (WH or ZH) and the H->bbbar decay channel (favored for MH<135 GeV/c2). Event selection is based on the leptonic decay of the vector boson and the identification of b-hadron enriched jets. Each individual channel is sensitive, for MH=115 GeV/c2, to less than 5 times the SM expected cross section and the most sensitive channels can exclude a production cross section of 2.3 x sigmaH SM.

The fixed point regime must be in the TeV region to solve the unitarity problem in the elastic scattering of W bosons. We find that the unification scale is at about 1014 GeV.

1205.2486,hep-ph,"We examine the implications of singlet-doublet Higgs mixing on the properties of a Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs boson within the Peccei-Quinn invariant extension of the NMSSM (PQ-NMSSM). The SM singlet added to the Higgs sector connects the PQ and visible sectors through a PQ-invariant non-renormalizable Kahler potential term, making the model free from the tadpole and domain-wall problems. For the case that the lightest Higgs boson is dominated by the singlet scalar, the Higgs mixing increases the mass of a SM-like Higgs boson while reducing its signal rate at collider experiments compared to the SM case. The Higgs mixing is important also in the region of parameter space where the NMSSM contribution to the Higgs mass is small, but its size is limited by the experimental constraints on the singlet-like Higgs boson and on the lightest neutralino constituted mainly by the singlino whose Majorana mass term is forbidden by the PQ symmetry. Nonetheless the Higgs mixing can increase the SM-like Higgs boson mass by a few GeV or more even when the Higgs signal rate is close to the SM prediction, and thus may be crucial for achieving a 125 GeV Higgs mass, as hinted by the recent ATLAS and CMS data. Such an effect can reduce the role of stop mixing.",12,[],2

At collider energies, supersymmetry breaking can be parameterised by soft supersymmetry breaking parameters. Several mechanisms for supersymmetry breaking have been proposed, which are all characterised by patterns in the high scale values of these parameters. Therefore, looking for such patterns will give us important clues about the way supersymmetry has been broken in Nature. In this master thesis, we study an approach to find these patterns using Renormalisation Group invariants. We construct sum rules that test properties of the spectrum at the scale of supersymmetry breaking, provided that the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is a good description of Nature at collider energies and all soft mass parameters and gauge couplings have been determined.

Because of the Dirichlet boundary condition for fermion at the positions of point interactions, profiles of chiral fermion zero modes are split and localized, and then we can realize three generations from each five-dimensional Dirac fermion. Our model allows fermion flavor mixing but the form of non-diagonal elements of fermion mass matrices is found to be severely restricted due to geometry of the extra dimension. The Robin boundary condition for a scalar leads to an extra coordinate-dependent vacuum expectation value, which can naturally explain the fermion mass hierarchy.",12,[],2

The minimal framework is however inadequate in the lepton sector due to the strong constraint from letter\ to e letter. This tension can be efficiently alleviated by realizing Partial Compositeness within Supersymmetry. The resulting models can saturate the CP asymmetry in D decays for superpartner masses close to the TeV scale and somewhat large A-terms. The supersymmetric realization of Partial Compositeness also offers a predictive and phenomenologically viable organizing principle for R-Parity violation, and may result in very distinctive signatures at hadron colliders.

In this note we consider the situation for models which do not attempt to solve the flavour problem. To treat them on equal footing, we consider the combined fine-tuning arising from electroweak symmetry breaking as well as from fulfilling flavour constraints. We also consider CP.

Taking into account the experimental constraints from previous direct searches, flavour physics, electroweak measurements as well as theoretical considerations, we find that a Higgs signal in the two photon channel with a rate equal to, or above, the SM prediction is viable over the full mass range equation, both in the MSSM and the NMSSM. We find that besides the interpretation of a possible signal at about equation in terms of the lightest equation-even Higgs boson, both the MSSM and the NMSSM permit also a viable interpretation where an observed state at about equation would correspond to the second-lightest equation-even Higgs boson in the spectrum, which would be accompanied by another light Higgs with suppressed couplings to equation and equation bosons.

We find that the equation production from the weak vector boson fusion process and the Drell-Yan process associated with equation are useful in testing the custodial symmetry of the Higgs sector at the LHC.

1207.5522,hep-ph,"Within the context of supersymmetric theories, explaining a 125 GeV Higgs motivates a consideration of a broader range of models. We consider a simple addition to the MSSM of a ""Sister Higgs"" (equation), a Higgs field that participates in electroweak symmetry breaking but does not give any direct masses to Standard Model matter fields. While a relatively minor addition, the phenomenological implications can be important. Such a field can be naturally charged under an additional symmetry group equation. If gauged, the Higgs mass is naturally much larger than in the MSSM through an NMSSM-type interaction, but with equation playing the role of equation. The addition of the sister Higgs allows new R-parity violating operators equation, which are less constrained than conventional leptonic R-parity violation. Considerations of unification motivates the presence of colored equation-charged fields. Production of these G-quarks can lead to new b-rich final states and modifications to decays of gluinos, as well as new opportunities for R-parity violation. Unlike a conventional fourth generation, G-quarks dominantly decay into a light jet and a scalar (potentially the Higgs), which then generally decays to b-jets. The presence of additional sister charges allows the possibilities that lightest sister-charged particle (LSiP) could be stable.

The LSP of this model is an XWIMP (extremely weak interaction particle). We have studied its relic density in the cases in which there is mixing with the neutralinos of the MSSM and in the case in which there is not such mixing. We have showed that this extended model can satisfy the WMAP data. To perform this calculation we have modified the DarkSUSY package.,12,[],2
1206.2318,hep-ph,The proton structure function F2 is studied in the low x regime using BFKL evolution. The next to leading logarithmic (NLL) analysis requires the inclusion of running coupling effects which lead to off-diagonal terms in the evolution kernel.

We treat the equation-quark in the heavy quark limit and the energetic light (equation) quarks within a variant of Large Energy Effective Theory combined with an extension of chiral quark models. Our calculated amplitude for equation is suppressed by a factor of order equation with respect to the factorized amplitude, as it should according to QCD-factorization. Further, for reasonable values of the (model dependent) gluon condensate and the constituent quark mass, the calculated nonfactorizable amplitude for equation can easily accomodate the experimental value. Unfortunately, the color suppressed amplitude is very sensitive to the values of these model dependent parameters.

1212.5989,hep-ph,"The recent result of the higgs search at the LHC experiment has lead to more attention to the supersymmetric standard models with heavy sfermions. Among them, the models with the almost pure wino being the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) have been widely discussed due to their success in providing a consistent dark matter candidate. The notable phenomenological feature of the wino LSP is the degeneracy with its charged SU(2)L partner (the charged wino) in mass. The tiny mass splitting makes the charged wino long-lived, which allows us to detect the wino production at the LHC experiment by searching for the disappearing charged tracks inside the detectors. Since the reach of the experiment is sensitive to the mass splitting, it is mandatory to estimate it very precisely. We therefore perform a full calculation of the mass splitting at two-loop level, and find that the splitting is reduced by a few MeV compared to the one-loop calculation. This reduction leads to about a 30 % longer lifetime of the charged wino, with which the current constraint on the wino mass by the ATLAS experiment is improved by about 10 %.",12,[],2

In order to reproduce the second texture, we find that the flavor symmetry should be equation, while for the first pattern the flavor symmetry should be extended to equation with equation and equation of different parity. Explicit models for both mixing patterns are constructed based on the flavor symmetries equation and equation.

1209.5488,hep-ph,"We ponder about neutrino oscillations; a particle without a clear identity, a neutrino of a given flavor in fact does not satisfy the Dirac equation (which is used to define the mass eigen-states and mass eigen-values). This alters the basic treatment of neutrino oscillations, in that the Dirac spinors are defined as the mass eigen-states while the flavor states can only be given as linear combinations of the mass eigen-states (of Dirac equations). Even though neutrino masses are tiny, the impacts of several neutrino masses in a single reaction or a single decay, such as possible violation of the energy-momentum conservation, should not be overlooked.   Among those sources of oscillating neutrinos, we point out that the ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECR's) such as the proton of energy equation or higher, used to think of being rather stable, can capture, in the matter media, an electron to convert into an electron-like neutrino and a spectator neutron.

The stringent minimal-survival-based estimates of the B-L scale are shown to be relaxed by as much as four orders of magnitude, thus admitting for a consistent implementation of the standard seesaw mechanism even without excessive fine-tuning implied by the previous studies.

If the new boson is the Higgs boson, the diphoton signal strength is 1.5 - 1.8 times larger than the Standard Model (SM) prediction, while the WW and ZZ signal strengths are in agreement with the SM one. In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), overall consistency can be achieved by a light stau and the large left-right mixing of staus. However, a light stau and large left-right mixing of staus may suffer from vacuum instability. We first apply the vacuum meta-stability condition to the Higgs to diphoton decay rate in the MSSM. We show that the vacuum meta-stablity severely constrains the enhancement to the Higgs to diphoton rate.

In this paper the addition of an S-wave within the equation system of equation and the subsequent impact of this on the angular distribution of the final state particles is explored. The inclusion of the S-wave causes a distinction between the values of the angular observables obtained from counting experiments and those obtained from fits to the angular distribution. The effect of a non-zero S-wave on an angular analysis of equation is assessed as a function of dataset size and the relative size of the S-wave amplitude.

Any future experimental analysis of the equation final state will have to take the S-wave contribution into account.",12,[],2
1210.4317,hep-ph,"While the modification of jets by a medium as created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions is often thought of as a phenomenon affecting a hard near on-shell parton and hence treated as partonic energy loss, a more realistic view is to think of the medium effect as a relatively small correction to the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) vacuum radiation pattern which reduces the initial high virtuality of hard partons and leads to the development of a shower. The uncertainty relation can be used to argue that a significant part of this shower is developed even before a medium can be formed. The initial virtuality of a shower-initiating parton is reflected in the final state in the measured invariant mass of a jet - high mass jets are characterized by more branchings, higher multiplicity and a wider angular structure. Since most of this structure is determined before the medium affects the jet, selecting a particular jet mass range strongly biases the partonic configuration that enters the medium, and thus the medium is expected to modify high mass jets more strongly than low mass jets. In this work, this scenario is explored using the in-medium shower evolution code YaJEM and a possible strategy for a measurement is suggested.",12,[],2

1212.3526,hep-ph,"We survey the expected polarization of the top produced in the decay of a scalar top quark, equation. The phenomenology is quite interesting, since the expected polarization depends both on the mixing in the stop and neutralino sectors and on the mass differences between the stop and the neutralino.

After a discussion on the expected top polarization from the decay of a scalar top quark, we focus on the interplay of polarization and kinematics at the LHC. We discuss different probes of the top polarization in terms of lab-frame observables. We find that these observables faithfully reflect the polarization of the parent top-quark, but also have a non-trivial dependence on the kinematics of the stop production and decay process. In addition, we illustrate the effect of top polarization on the energy and transverse momentum of the decay lepton in the laboratory frame. Our results show that both spectra are softened substantially in case of a negatively polarized top, particularly for a large mass difference between the stop and the neutralino. Thus, the search strategies, and the conclusions that can be drawn from them, depends not just on the mass difference equation due to the usual kinematic effects but also on the effects of top polarization on the decay kinematics the extent of which depends in turn on the said mass difference.",12,[],2

Here, we consider the impact of these recent LHC results on several variants of the CMSSM with a primary focus on obtaining a Higgs mass of ~125 GeV. In particular, we consider the one- and two-parameter extensions of the CMSSM with one or both of the Higgs masses set independently of the common sfermion mass, m0 (the NUHM1,2). We also consider the one-parameter extension of the CMSSM in which the input universality scale Min is below the GUT scale (the sub-GUT CMSSM). We find that when Min < MGUT large regions of parameter space open up where the relic density of neutralinos can successfully account for dark matter with a Higgs boson mass ~125 GeV. In some of these regions essential roles are played by coannihilation processes that are usually less important in the CMSSM with Min = MGUT. Finally, we reconsider mSUGRA models with sub-GUT universality, which have the same number of parameters as the CMSSM.

An assumed non-vanishing mass of every ultralight neutrino and the observed non-decoupling of any neutrino generation allow a maximum of four zeros in the Yukawa coupling matrix equation in family space. There are seventy two such textures. We show that the requirement of an exact equation symmetry, coupled with the observational constraints, reduces these seventy two allowed textures to only four corresponding to just two different forms of the light neutrino mass matrix equation, resulting in an inverted/normal mass ordering. The effect of each of these on measurable quantities can be described, apart from an overall factor of the neutrino mass scale, in terms of two real parameters and a phase angle all of which are within very constrained ranges. The masses and Majorana phases of ultralight neutrinos are predicted within definite ranges with equation laboratory and cosmological observational inputs. The rate for equation decay, though generally below the reach of planned experiments, could approach it in some parameteric regions. Within the same framework, we also study Yukawa textures with a fewer number of zeros, but with exact equation symmetry.

However some of the D7-brane embeddings have no CME, after applying alpha'-correction, they find a non-zero value for the CME. As a result the number of solutions with a non-zero CME increases.

1205.0176,hep-th,"Non-compact symmetries of extended 4d supergravities involve duality rotations of vectors and thus are not manifest off-shell invariances in standard ""second-order"" formulation.

Using a ""doubled"" formulation, where fields and their momenta are treated on an equal footing and the duality becomes a manifest symmetry of the action (at the expense of Lorentz symmetry), we argue that the corresponding on-shell quantum effective action or S-matrix are duality symmetric as well as Lorentz invariant. The simplest case of discrete Z2 duality corresponds to a symmetry of the S-matrix under flipping the sign of the negative-chirality scalars in 2 dimensions or phase rotations of chiral (definite-helicity) parts of vectors in 4 dimensions.

1205.3847,hep-th,"When matter falls past the horizon of a large black hole, the expectation from string theory is that the configuration thermalizes and the information in the probe is rather quickly scrambled away. The traditional view of a classical unique spacetime near a black hole horizon conflicts with this picture. The question then arises as to what spacetime does the probe actually see as it crosses a horizon, and how does the background geometry imprint its signature onto the thermal properties of the probe. In this work, we explore these questions through an extensive series of numerical simulations of D0 branes. We determine that the D0 branes quickly settle into an incompressible symmetric state -- thermalized within a few oscillations through a process driven entirely by internal non-linear dynamics. Surprisingly, thermal background fluctuations play no role in this mechanism. Signatures of the background fields in this thermal state arise either through fluxes, i.e. black hole hair; or if the probe expands to the size of the horizon -- which we see evidence of. We determine simple scaling relations for the D0 branes' equilibrium size, time to thermalize, lifetime, and temperature in terms of their number, initial energy, and the background fields. Our results are consistent with the conjecture that black holes are the fastest scramblers as seen by Matrix theory.",12,[],4

The latest lattice results favor the decoupling solutions. In this contribution, after giving a brief overview of the present status of analytical and semi-analytical approaches to the infrared regime of Landau gauge Yang-Mills theory, we will show how Callan-Symanzik renormalization group equations in an epsilon expansion reproduce both types of solutions and single out the decoupling solutions as the infrared-stable ones for space-time dimensions greater than two, in agreement with the lattice calculations.",12,[],4

The computation is based on the saddle point method. This allows to find an analytic expression for the Nf = 4, U(2) instanton twisted superpotential and, in turn, to sum up the 4-point classical block. It is well known that the critical value of the Liouville action functional is the generating function of the accessory parameters. This statement and the factorization property of the 4-point action allow to express the unknown accessory parameter as the derivative of the 4-point classical block with respect to the modular parameter of the 4-punctured sphere. It has been found that this accessory parameter is related to the sum of all rescaled column lengths of the so-called 'critical' Young diagram extremizing the instanton 'free energy'.

This is generalized to all the higher levels in this paper. An interacting theory of an infinite tower of massive higher spins is obtained. They appear as a compactification of a massless theory in one higher dimension. The compactification and consequent mass is essential for writing the interaction terms. Just as for spin 2 and spin 3, the interactions are in terms of gauge invariant field strengths and the gauge transformations are the same as for the free theory. This theory can then be truncated in a gauge invari- ant way by removing one oscillator of the extra dimension to match the field content of BRST string (field) theory. The truncation has to be done level by level and results are given explicitly for level 4. At least up to level 5, the truncation can be done in a way that preserves the higher dimensional structure. There is a relatively straightforward generalization of this construction to (arbitrary) curved space time and this is also outlined.",12,[],4

In the free scalar theory the gaps are of order \sqrt letter/N and in the critical scalar theory and the free fermion theory they are of order letter/N. The entropy of these states grows like N Log(k). We briefly consider spatial surfaces of higher genus. Based on results from pure Chern-Simons theory, it appears that there are light states with entropy that grows even faster, like N2 Log(k). This is consistent with the log of the partition function on the three sphere S3, which also behaves like N2 Log(k).

We show that, on the gravity side of the correspondence, this follows directly (for arbitrary quark motion, and independently of any approximations) from the fact that the string dual to the quark remains unexpectedly close to the AdS boundary whenever the quark moves ultra-relativistically. We also work out the validity conditions for a related approximation scheme that proposed to explain the beaming effect though the formation of shock waves in the bulk fields emitted by the string.

1207.5889,math,"A category of Brauer diagrams, analogous to Turaev's tangle category, is introduced, and a presentation of the category is given; specifically, we prove that seven relations among its four generating homomorphisms suffice to deduce all equations among the morphisms. Full tensor functors are constructed from this category to the category of tensor representations of the orthogonal group equation or the symplectic group equation over any field of characteristic zero. The first and second fundamental theorems of invariant theory for these classical groups are generalised to the category theoretic setting. The major outcome is that we obtain new presentations for the endomorphism algebras of the module equation. These are obtained by appending to the standard presentation of the Brauer algebra of degree equation one additional relation. This relation stipulates the vanishing of an element of the Brauer algebra which is quasi-idempotent, and which we describe explicitly both in terms of diagrams and algebraically. In the symplectic case, if equation, the element is precisely the central idempotent in the Brauer subalgebra of degree equation, which corresponds to its trivial representation. Since this is the Brauer algebra of highest degree which is semisimple, our generator is an exact analogue for the Brauer algebra of the Jones idempotent of the Temperley-Lieb algebra. In the orthogonal case the additional relation is also a quasi-idempotent in the integral Brauer algebra.

1201.3090,nlin,"The existence and stability of localized patterns of criminal activity are studied for the reaction-diffusion model of urban crime that was introduced by Short et. al. [Math. Models. Meth. Appl. Sci., 18, Suppl. (2008), pp. 1249--1267]. Such patterns, characterized by the concentration of criminal activity in localized spatial regions, are referred to as hot-spot patterns and they occur in a parameter regime far from the Turing point associated with the bifurcation of spatially uniform solutions. Singular perturbation techniques are used to construct steady-state hot-spot patterns in one and two-dimensional spatial domains, and new types of nonlocal eigenvalue problems are derived that determine the stability of these hot-spot patterns to equation time-scale instabilities. From an analysis of these nonlocal eigenvalue problems, a critical threshold equation is determined such that a pattern consisting of equation hot-spots is unstable to a competition instability if equation. This instability, due to a positive real eigenvalue, triggers the collapse of some of the hot-spots in the pattern. Furthermore, in contrast to the well-known stability results for spike patterns of the Gierer-Meinhardt reaction-diffusion model, it is shown for the crime model that there is only a relatively narrow parameter range where oscillatory instabilities in the hot-spot amplitudes occur. Such an instability, due to a Hopf bifurcation, is studied explicitly for a single hot-spot in the shadow system limit, for which the diffusivity of criminals is asymptotically large. Finally, the parameter regime where localized hot-spots occur is compared with the parameter regime, studied in previous works, where Turing instabilities from a spatially uniform steady-state occur.",12,[],9

1209.0073,nlin,"The analysis on stability and bifurcations in the macroscopic dynamics exhibited by the system of two coupled large populations comprised of equation stochastic excitable units each is performed by studying an approximate system, obtained by replacing each population with the corresponding mean-field model. In the exact system, one has the units within an ensemble communicating via the time-delayed linear couplings, whereas the inter-ensemble terms involve the nonlinear time-delayed interaction mediated by the appropriate global variables. The aim is to demonstrate that the bifurcations affecting the stability of the stationary state of the original system, governed by a set of 4N stochastic delay-differential equations for the microscopic dynamics, can accurately be reproduced by a flow containing just four deterministic delay-differential equations which describe the evolution of the mean-field based variables. In particular, the considered issues include determining the parameter domains where the stationary state is stable, the scenarios for the onset and the time-delay induced suppression of the collective mode, as well as the parameter domains admitting bistability between the equilibrium and the oscillatory state. We show how analytically tractable bifurcations occurring in the approximate model can be used to identify the characteristic mechanisms by which the stationary state is destabilized under different system configurations, like those with symmetrical or asymmetrical inter-population couplings.",12,[],9

We report on a novel form of these states, found in a widely used model of a limit-cycle oscillator if one goes beyond the limit of weak coupling typical for phase oscillators. Then patches of synchronized dynamics appear within the incoherent domain giving rise to a multi-chimera state.

The additional spatial modulation is due to strong coupling interaction and thus cannot be observed in simple phase-oscillator models.",12,[],9
1206.5195,nlin,"We study a car-following model of traffic flow which assumes only that a car's acceleration depends on its own speed, the headway ahead of it, and the rate of change of headway, with only minimal assumptions about the functional form of that dependence. The velocity of uniform steady flow is found implicitly from the acceleration function, and its linear stability criterion can be expressed simply in terms of it. Crucially, unlike in previously analyzed car-following models, the threshold of absolute stability does not generally coincide with an inflection point in the steady velocity function. The Burgers and KdV equations can be derived under the usual assumptions, but the mKdV equation arises only when absolute stability does coincide with an inflection point. Otherwise, the KdV equation applies near absolute stability, while near the inflection point one obtains the mKdV equation plus an extra, quadratic term. Corrections to the KdV equation ""select"" a single member of the one-parameter set of soliton solutions. In previous models this has always marked the threshold of a finite- amplitude instability of steady flow, but here it can alternatively be a stable, small-amplitude jam. That is, there can be a forward bifurcation from steady flow. The new, augmented mKdV equation which holds near an inflection point admits a continuous family of kink solutions, like the mKdV equation, and we derive the selection criterion arising from the corrections to this equation.",12,[],9

We extend these results by completely unfolding the bifurcation structure of the mean field approximation. Our analysis reveals a direct correspondence between the different dynamical behaviors found in different regions of the coupling-time delay plane with the different classes of simulated coherent swarm patterns. We derive the spatio-temporal scales of the swarm structures, and also demonstrate how the complicated interplay of coupling strength, time delay, noise intensity, and choice of initial conditions can affect the swarm. In particular, our studies show that for sufficiently large values of the coupling strength and/or the time delay, there is a noise intensity threshold that forces a transition of the swarm from a misaligned state into an aligned state. We show that this alignment transition exhibits hysteresis when the noise intensity is taken to be time dependent.",12,[],9

1204.2463,nlin,"Spatial pattern formation is a key feature of many natural systems in physics, chemistry and biology. The essential theoretical issue in understanding pattern formation is to explain how a spatially homogeneous initial state can undergo spontaneous symmetry breaking leading to a stable spatial pattern. This problem is most commonly studied using partial differential equations to model a reaction-diffusion system of the type introduced by Turing. We report here on a much simpler and more robust model of spatial pattern formation, which is formulated as a novel type of coupled map lattice. In our model, the local site dynamics are coupled through a competitive, rather than diffusive, interaction. Depending only on the strength of the interaction, this competitive coupling results in spontaneous symmetry breaking of a homogeneous initial configuration and the formation of stable spatial patterns.

This transition is induced by flooding, i.e., the disappearance of regular states due to increasing regular-to-chaotic couplings. We account for this effect by a flooding-improved Berry-Robnik distribution, in which an effectively reduced size of the regular island enters. To additionally describe power-law level repulsion at small spacings, we extend this prediction by explicitly considering the tunneling couplings between regular and chaotic states. This results in a flooding- and tunneling-improved Berry-Robnik distribution which is in excellent agreement with numerical data.",12,[],9

1204.2867,nlin,"TheMinority Game (MG) has become a paradigm to probe complex social and economical phenomena where adaptive agents compete for a limited resource, and it finds applications in statistical and nonlinear physics as well. In the traditional MG model, agents are assumed to have access to global information about the past history of the underlying system, and they react by choosing one of the two available options associated with a single resource. Complex systems arising in a modern society, however, can possess many resources so that the number of available strategies/resources can be multiple. We propose a class of models to investigate MG dynamics with multiple strategies. In particular, in such a system, at any time an agent can either choose a minority strategy (say with probability p) based on available local information or simply choose a strategy randomly (with probability 1 - p). The parameter p thus defines the minority-preference probability, which is key to the dynamics of the underlying system. A striking finding is the emergence of strategy-grouping states where a particular number of agents choose a particular subset of strategies. We develop an analytic theory based on the mean-field framework to understand the ""bifurcation"" to the grouping states and their evolution. The grouping phenomenon has also been revealed in a real-world example of the subsystem of 27 stocks in the Shanghai Stock Market's Steel Plate.

Resonance bifurcations for heteroclinic networks are more complicated because different subcycles in the network can undergo resonance at different parameter values, but have, until now, not been systematically studied. In this article we present the first investigation of resonance bifurcations in heteroclinic networks. Specifically, we study two heteroclinic networks in equation and consider the dynamics that occurs as various subcycles in each network change stability. The two cases are distinguished by whether or not one of the equilibria in the network has real or complex contracting eigenvalues. We construct two-dimensional Poincare return maps and use these to investigate the dynamics of trajectories near the network. At least one equilibrium solution in each network has a two-dimensional unstable manifold, and we use the technique developed in [18] to keep track of all trajectories within these manifolds. In the case with real eigenvalues, we show that the asymptotically stable network loses stability first when one of two distinguished cycles in the network goes through resonance and two or six periodic orbits appear. In the complex case, we show that an infinite number of stable and unstable periodic orbits are created at resonance, and these may coexist with a chaotic attractor. There is a further resonance, for which the eigenvalue combination is a property of the entire network, after which the periodic orbits which originated from the individual resonances may interact. We illustrate some of our results with a numerical example.",12,[],9

1211.6129,nlin,"In this article, we report on the curious phenomena of anomalous spreading in a system of coupled Fisher-KPP equations. When a single parameter is set to zero, the system consists of two uncoupled Fisher-KPP equations which give rise to traveling fronts propagating with the unique, minimal KPP speed. When the coupling parameter is nonzero various behaviors can be observed. Anomalous spreading occurs when one component of the system spreads at a speed significantly faster in the coupled system than it does in isolation, while the speed of the second component remains unchanged. We study these anomalous spreading speeds and show that they arise due to poles of the pointwise Green's function corresponding to the linearizion about the unstable homogeneous state. These poles lead to anomalous spreading in the linearized system and come in two varieties -- one that persists and leads to anomalous spreading for the nonlinear system and one that does not. We describe the mechanisms leading to these two behaviors and prove that one class of poles are irrelevant as far as nonlinear wavespeed selection is concerned. Finally, we show that the same mechanism can give rise to anomalous spreading even when the slower component does not spread.",12,[],9

1206.3986,nlin,"We apply to bidimensional chaotic maps the numerical method proposed by Ginelli et al. to approximate the associated Oseledets splitting, i.e. the set of linear subspaces spanned by the so called covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLV) and corresponding to the Lyapunov spectrum. These subspaces are the analog of linearized invariant manifolds for non-periodic points, so the angles between them can be used to quantify the degree of hyperbolicity of generic orbits; however, being such splitting non invariant under smooth transformations of phase space, it is interesting to investigate the properties of transversality when coordinates change, e.g. to study it in distinct dynamical systems. To illustrate this issue on the Chirikov-Taylor standard map we compare the probability densities of transversality for two different coordinate systems; these are connected by a linear transformation that deforms splitting angles through phase space, changing also the probability density of almost-zero angles although complete tangencies are in fact invariant. This is completely due to the PDF transformation law and strongly suggests that any statistical inference from such distributions must be generally taken with care.",12,[],9

However, rare cases with equation may be present and actually dominate scattering events. We consider the statistical properties of these super-sharp resonances.

Such a long-standing issue is revisited in the light of modern ergodic theory of dynamical systems and becomes particularly interesting from a pedagogical perspective due to its close link with Poincar\'e's recurrence. Using such a connection, a very general result of ergodic theory - Kac's lemma - can be used to establish the intrinsic limitations to the possibility of predicting the future from the past. In spite of a naive expectation, predictability results to be hindered rather by the effective number of degrees of freedom of a system than by the presence of chaos. If the effective number of degrees of freedom becomes large enough, regardless the regular or chaotic nature of the system, predictions turn out to be practically impossible.

The non-hyper-elliptic curves lead to great difficulty in the construction of algebro-geometric solutions of the DP equation. In this paper, we derive the DP hierarchy with the help of Lenard recursion operators. Based on the characteristic polynomial of a Lax matrix for the DP hierarchy, we introduce a third order algebraic curve equation with genus equation, from which the associated Baker-Akhiezer functions, meromorphic function and Dubrovin-type equations are established.

1206.3118,nlin,"Generic 2D Hamiltonian systems possess partial barriers in their chaotic phase space that restrict classical transport. Quantum mechanically the transport is suppressed if Planck's constant h is large compared to the classical flux, h >> Phi, such that wave packets and states are localized. In contrast, classical transport is mimicked for h << Phi. Designing a quantum map with an isolated partial barrier of controllable flux Phi is the key to investigating the transition from this form of quantum localization to mimicking classical transport. It is observed that quantum transport follows a universal transition curve as a function of the expected scaling parameter Phi/h. We find this curve to be symmetric to Phi/h=1, having a width of two orders of magnitude in Phi/h, and exhibiting no quantized steps.

We show first that all solutions of the equation converge to the set of equilibria, second that the set of equilibria undergoes a bifurcation representing the transition to coherence when the coupling strength is increased. These two properties are similar to the situation with linear diffusion. Nevertheless nonlinear diffusion alters the transition scenari, which are different when the diffusion is sub-quadratic and when the diffusion is super-quadratic. When the diffusion is super-quadratic, it results in a multistability region that preceeds the pitchfork bifurcation at which the uncoherent equilibrium looses stability. When the diffusion is quadratic the pitchfork bifurcation at the onset of coherence is infinitely degenerate and a disk of equilibria exist for the critical value of the coupling strength. Another impact of nonlinear diffusion is that coherent equilibria become localized when advection is strong enough, a phenomenon that is preculded when the diffusion is linear.",12,[],9

This procedure imposes an integer power of the density for the density dependent terms of the functional. At present, only dated parameterizations of the Skyrme interaction fulfill this condition. [Purpose] To construct a set of parameterizations of the Skyrme energy density functional for multi-reference energy density functional calculations with regularization using the state-of-the-art fitting protocols.

Subsequently, these parameter sets were validated against properties of spherical and deformed nuclei. [Results] Our parameter sets successfully reproduce the experimental binding energies and charge radii for a wide range of singly-magic nuclei. Compared to the widely used SLy5 and to the SIII parameterization that has integer powers of the density, a significant improvement of the reproduction of the data is observed. Similarly, a good description of the deformation properties at equation was obtained. [Conclusions] We have constructed new Skyrme parameterizations with integer powers of the density and validated them against a broad set of experimental data for spherical and deformed nuclei.

Two-nucleon overlap functions are defined in various coordinate systems, and their transformation coefficients given between coordinate systems.

We show that the coherent state variables have to be renormalized and not the interaction terms of the Hamiltonian, as is usually done.

We discuss effects induced by dineutron on the angular distribution of the neutron-deuteron elastic scattering and cross sections of the deuteron breakup. A comparison to the available data for neutron-deuteron total cross sections and elastic scattering angular distributions cannot decisively exclude a possibility that the two neutrons can form 1S0 bound state.

We propose to include a tensor and a tensor-isospin term in finite-range interactions of Gogny type. The parameters of the two tensor terms allow us to treat separately the like-nucleon and the neutron-proton contributions. Two parameterizations of the tensor terms have been chosen to reproduce different neutron single-particle properties in the 48Ca nucleus and the energy of the first 0- state in the 16O nucleus. By employing these two parameterizations we analyze the evolution of the N=14, 28, and 90 neutron energy gaps in oxygen, calcium and tin isotopes, respectively.

In this paper the physical reasons of the Coulomb renormalization of the ANC are addressed. Using Pinkston-Satchler equation the ratio for the proton and neutron ANCs of mirror nuclei is obtained in terms of the Wronskians from the radial overlap functions and regular solutions of the two-body Schrodinger equation with the short-range interaction excluded. This ratio allows one to use microscopic overlap functions for mirror nuclei in the internal region, where they are the most accurate, to correctly predict the ratio of the ANCs for mirror nuclei, which determine the amplitudes of the tails of the overlap functions. Calculations presented for different nuclei demonstrate the Coulomb renormalization effects and independence of the ratio of the nucleon ANCs for mirror nuclei on the channel radius. This ratio is valid both for bound states and resonances. One of the goals of this paper is to draw attention on the possibility to use the Coulomb renormalized ANCs rather than the standard ones especially when the standard ANCs are too large.",12,[],11
1212.4460,nucl-th,"Two important parametrizations of momentum-dependent nucleonic fields, proposed for the simulations of central heavy-ion collisions, one by Gale et al. and the other by Welke et al., suffer from practical limitations. The first gives rise to mean fields isotropic in momentum, even when underlying momentum distributions are anisotropic, making descriptions of early nonequilibrium stages of collisions unrealistic. The second parametrization gives rise to anisotropic mean fields, but is computationally expensive, because the mean field has to be computed separately for every location of a nucleon in phase space, through folding. Here we construct a parametrization of the nucleonic mean field that yields an anisotropic mean field for an anisotropic momentum distribution and is inexpensive computationally. To demonstrate the versatility of our parametrization, we take the case of results from the parametrization by Welke et al. and attempt to approximate them. In arriving at a suitable anisotropic mean-field potential, we draw, on one hand, from the idea behind the parametrization of Gale et al., of a separable expansion of the potential energy, and, on the other, from the idea of a parallel expansion of the energy and mean field in anisotropy. We show that using our novel parametrization we can qualitatively and partially quantitatively reproduce the features of the mean-field parametrization of Welke et al..

1203.2606,nucl-th,"In order to describe heavy-ion fusion reactions around the Coulomb barrier with an actinide target nucleus, we propose a model which combines the coupled-channels approach and a fluctuation-dissipation model for dynamical calculations. This model takes into account couplings to the collective states of the interacting nuclei in the penetration of the Coulomb barrier and the subsequent dynamical evolution of a nuclear shape from the contact configuration. In the fluctuation-dissipation model with a Langevin equation, the effect of nuclear orientation at the initial impact on the prolately deformed target nucleus is considered. Fusion-fission, quasi-fission and deep quasi-fission are separated as different Langevin trajectories on the potential energy surface. Using this model, we analyze the experimental data for the mass distribution of fission fragments (MDFF) in the reactions of equationSequationU and equationSiequationU at several incident energies around the Coulomb barrier. We find that the time scale in the quasi-fission as well as the deformation of fission fragments at the scission point are different between the equationSiequationU and equationSequationU systems, causing different mass asymmetries of the quasi-fission.",12,[],11

The ""infinite"" parton matter is simulated by a system of quarks and gluons within a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions, at different energy densities, initialized slightly out of kinetic and chemical equilibrium. We investigate the approach of the system to equilibrium and the time scales for the equilibration of different observables. We, furthermore, study particle distributions in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) including partonic spectral functions, momentum distributions, abundances of the different parton species and their fluctuations (scaled variance, skewness, and kurtosis) in equilibrium. We also compare the results of the microscopic calculations with the ansatz of the DQPM. It is found that the results of the transport calculations are in equilibrium well matched by the DQPM for quarks and antiquarks, while the gluon spectral function shows a slightly different shape due to the explicit interaction of partons. The time scales for the relaxation of fluctuation observables are found to be shorter than those for the average values.

We calculate potential-energy surfaces for a typical actinide nucleus and for 12 even isotopes in the range equationHg--equationHg, to investigate the similarities and differences of actinide compared to mercury potential surfaces and to what extent fission-fragment properties, in particular shell structure, relate to the structure of the static potential-energy surfaces. Potential-energy surfaces are calculated in the macroscopic-microscopic approach as functions of fiveshape coordinates for more than five million shapes. The structure of the surfaces are investigated by use of an immersion technique. We determine properties of minima, saddle points, valleys, and ridges between valleys in the 5D shape-coordinate space. Along the mercury isotope chain the barrier heights and the ridge heights and persistence with elongation vary significantly and show no obvious connection to possible fragment shell structure, in contrast to the actinide region, where there is a deep asymmetric valley extending from the saddle point to scission. The mechanism of asymmetric fission must be very different in the lighter proton-rich mercury isotopes compared to the actinide region and is apparently unrelated to fragment shell structure. Isotopes lighter than equationHg have the saddle point blocked from a deep symmetric valley by a significant ridge. The ridge vanishes for the heavier Hg isotopes, for which we would expect a qualitatively different asymmetry of the fragments.",12,[],11
1210.5028,nucl-th,"One of the useful and practical methods for solving quantum-mechanical many-body systems is to recast the full problem into a form of the effective interaction acting within a model space of tractable size. Many of the effective-interaction theories in nuclear physics have been formulated by use of the so called equation box introduced by Kuo et.al. It has been one of the central problems how to calculate the equation box accurately and efficiently. We first show that, introducing new basis states, the Hamiltonian is transformed to a block-tridiagonal form in terms of submatrices with small dimension. With this transformed Hamiltonian, we next prove that the equation box can be expressed in two ways: One is a form of continued fraction and the other is a simple series expansion up to second order with respect to renormalized vertices and propagators. This procedure ensures to derive an exact equation box, if the calculation converges as the dimension of the Hilbert space tends to infinity. The equation box given in this study corresponds to a non-perturbative solution for the energy-dependent effective interaction which is often referred to as the Bloch-Horowitz or the Feshbach form. By applying the equation-box approach based on the equation box proposed previously, we introduce a graphical method for solving the eigenvalue problem of the Hamiltonian. The present approach has a possibility of resolving many of the difficulties encountered in the effective-interaction theory.",12,[],11

These key features clarify, in particular, why an S3 cell interpretation as a crystal-cell model in which the specific cell geometry is without physical significance, as tentatively adopted by Adhikari et al., is insufficient.

1204.2347,nucl-th,"Simulated results from a 21D relativistic viscous hydrodynamic model have been compared to the experimental data on the centrality dependence of invariant yield, elliptic flow (equation), and hexadecapole flow (equation) as a function of transverse momentum (equation) of charged hadrons in Au-Au collisions at equation = 200 GeV. Results from two types of initial transverse energy density profile, one based on the Glauber model and other based on Color-Glass-Condensate (CGC) are presented. We observe no difference in the simulated results on the invariant yield of charged hadrons for the calculations with different initial conditions. The comparison to the experimental data on invariant yield of charged hadrons supports a shear viscosity to entropy density ratio (equation) between 0 to 0.12 for the 0-10% to 40-50% collision centralities. The simulated equation is found to be higher for a fluid with CGC based initial condition compared to Glauber based initial condition for a given collision centrality. Consequently the Glauber based calculations when compared to the experimental data requires a lower value of equation relative to CGC based calculations. In addition, a centrality dependence of the estimated equation is observed from the equation study. The equation for the collision centralities 0-10% to 40-50% supports a equation value between 0 - 0.08 for a CGC based initial condition. While simulated results using the Glauber based initial condition for the ideal fluid evolution under estimates the equation for collision centralities 0-10% to 30-40%.",12,[],11

1205.3230,nucl-th,"We study recently proposed ultraviolet and infrared momentum regulators of the model spaces formed by construction of a variational trial wavefunction which uses a complete set of many-body basis states based upon three-dimensional harmonic oscillator (HO) functions. These model spaces are defined by a truncation of the expansion characterized by a counting number (equation) and by the intrinsic scale (equation) of the HO basis; in short by the ordered pair (equation). In this study we choose for equation the truncation parameter equation related to the maximum number of oscillator quanta, above the minimum configuration, kept in the model space. The ultraviolet (uv) momentum cutoff of the continuum is readily mapped onto a defined uv cutoff in this finite model space, but there are two proposed definitions of the infrared (ir) momentum cutoff inherent in a finite-dimensional HO basis. One definition is based upon the lowest momentum difference given by equation itself and the other upon the infrared momentum which corresponds to the maximal radial extent used to encompass the many-body system in coordinate space. Extending both the uv cutoff to infinity and the ir cutoff to zero is prescribed for a converged calculation. We calculate the ground state energy of light nuclei with ""bare"" and ""soft"" equation interactions. By doing so, we investigate the behaviors of the uv and ir regulators of model spaces used to describe equationH, equationH, equationHe and equationHe with equation potentials Idaho NequationLO and JISP16.

1210.5942,physics,"Recently, several theoretical proposals adressed the generation of an active optical frequency standard based on atomic ensembles trapped in an optical lattice potential inside an optical resonator. Using atoms with a narrow linewidth transition and population inversion together with a ""bad"" cavity allows to the realize the superradiant photon emission regime. These schemes reduce the influence of mechanical or thermal vibrations of the cavity mirrors on the emitted optical frequency, overcoming current limitation in passive optical standards. The coherence time of the emitted light is ultimately limited by the lifetime of the atoms in the optical lattice potential. Therefore these schemes would produce one light pulse per atomic ensemble without a phase relation between pulses.

As a result, it is necessary to reduce the complexity of large bipartite systems and preserve the functionality at the same time. We observe, however, the existing coarse graining methods for binary networks fail to work in the bipartite networks. In this paper, we use the spectral analysis to design a coarse graining scheme specifically for bipartite networks and keep their random walk properties unchanged. Numerical analysis on artificial and real-world bipartite networks indicates that our coarse graining scheme could obtain much smaller networks from large ones, keeping most of the relevant spectral properties. Finally, we further validate the coarse graining method by directly comparing the mean first passage time between the original network and the reduced one.",12,[],5

1203.5942,physics,"Recently developed series representations of the Boltzmann operator are used to obtain Quantum Mechanical results for the matrix elements, <x exp(-letter H)x>, of the imaginary time propagator. The calculations are done for two different potential surfaces: one of them is an Eckart Barrier and the other one is a double well potential surface. Numerical convergence of the series are investigated. Although the zeroth order term is sufficient at high temperatures, it does not lead to the correct saddle point structure at low temperatures where the tunneling is important. Nevertheless the series converges rapidly even at low temperatures. Some of the double well calculations are also done with the bare potential (without Gaussian averaging). Some equations of motion related with bare potentials are also derived. The use of the bare potential results in faster integrations of equations of motion. Although, it causes lower accuracy in the zeroth order approximation, the series show similar convergence properties both for Gaussian averaged calculations and the bare potential calculations. However, the series may not converge for bare potential calculations at low temperatures because of the low accuracy of zeroth order approximation. Interestingly, it is found that the number of saddle points of <x exp(-letter H)x> increases as the temperature is lowered. An explanation of observed structures at low temperatures remains as a challenge. Besides, it has implications for the quantum instanton theory of reaction rates at very low temperatures.",12,[],5

Distances between two neighboring asperities have been described by gamma distribution. Being repealed by highly charged asperities the electrons of the bunch move along non-regular periodical trajectories in the planes parallel to the metallic surface. The spatial periods of the trajectories are random quantities which are described by the same gamma distribution. The radiation characteristics of the bunch have been obtained. It is shown that the angular distributions of the number of photons radiated from the bunch and from a single electron are the same but the frequency distribution of the bunch is being drastically changed at the hard frequency region.

Given this essentially linear response, a modal identification is performed in the mid-frequency domain [300-2500] Hz by means of a novel high resolution modal analysis technique (Ege, Boutillon and David, JSV, 2009). The modal density of the spruce board varies between 0.05 and 0.01 modes/Hz and the mean loss factor is found to be approximately 2%. Below 1.1 kHz, the modal density is very close to that of a homogeneous isotropic plate with clamped boundary conditions. Higher in frequency, the soundboard behaves as a set of waveguides defined by the ribs.

Although modern physical cosmology is undoubtedly scientific, it is not obvious why it has this status, and nor is it obvious that all branches of theoretical cosmology satisfy ordinarily assumed criteria for science. While testability is generally admitted as an indispensable criterion for a theory being scientific, there is no agreement among cosmologists what testability means, more precisely. For example, should testability be taken to imply falsifiability in the sense of Popper?

That observation can be used to project target paces for a desired marathon finish time. However, that estimate fails to take in to account the energetic costs of elevation changes (hills) along the marathon course.

A new type of Double-Tapered Round (DTR) dowels is proposed, and the performance of DTR dowels is compared to that of traditional cylindrical dowels. Linear Elastic (LE) analysis are performed in Abaqus (v-6.11) order to identify the optimized geometry of DTR dowels that would achieve (1) highest load transfer across adjacent slabs through shear action, and (2) lowest bearing stresses on the concrete. LE analyses are complemented by nonlinear FE analysis. The Riks method available in Abaqus/Standard, coupled with the Concrete Damaged Plasticity (CDP) model is used to simulate the degradation of concrete surrounding both DTR the traditional cylindrical dowels. Results obtained show that the use of DTR dowels can reduce bearing stresses at the face of the joint by as much 2.2 times as compared to traditional cylindrical dowels. While adequate load-transfer is a crucial part for the proper performance pavement structures, the load-transfer capacity of DTR dowels was more effective over cylindrical dowels by as far as 116%. In the inelastic range, even after significant concrete degradation and steel yielding, DTR dowels maintained a higher load-transfer capacity than traditional cylindrical dowels, and also presented lower amounts of differential deflections across concrete floors.

1212.3123,physics,"The sensitivity of inertial confinement fusion implosions of the type performed on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) to low-mode flux asymmetries has been investigated numerically. It is shown that large-amplitude, low-order mode shapes (Legendre polynomial P4), resulting from associated low order flux asymmetries, cause spatial variations in capsule and fuel momentum that prevent the DT ice layer from being decelerated uniformly by the hot spot pressure. This reduces the transfer of kinetic to internal energy of the central hot spot, thus reducing neutron yield. Furthermore, synthetic gated x-ray images of the hot spot self-emission indicate that P4 shapes may be unquantifiable for DT layered capsules. Instead the positive P4 asymmetry aliases itself as an oblate P4 in the x-ray self emission images. Correction of this apparent P2 distortion can further distort the implosion while creating a round x-ray image.

1205.2471,physics,"Pulsed terahertz (THz) radiation, generated through optical rectification (OR) by exciting [110] ZnTe crystal with ultrafast optical pulses, typically consists of only a few cycles of electromagnetic field oscillations with a duration about a couple of picoseconds. However, it is possible, under appropriate conditions, to generate a long damped oscillation tail (LDOT) following the main cycles. The LDOT can last tens of picoseconds and its Fourier transform shows a higher and narrower frequency peak than that of the main pulse. We have demonstrated that the generation of the LDOT depends on both the duration of the optical pulse and its central wavelength. Furthermore, we have also performed theoretical calculations based upon the OR effect coupled with the phonon-polariton mode of ZnTe and obtained theoretical THz waveforms in good agreement with our experimental observation.",12,[],5

It was not the worst such catastrophic event in recent Italian history, but it was one of -- if not the -- worst failures of risk assessment and preventive action. The six were found guilty and condemned by a first level of the justice system to substantial prison terms. The outcry provoked by the verdict in the world press and the international scientific community has fueled the already fiery debate over whether the six should have been tried at all. They have been presented as martyrs to science being treated as scapegoats by a scientifically illiterate justice system and inflamed local population for not being able to perform the impossible (predict the event). Petitions of support have been drafted and signed by thousands of working scientists and technical experts in many fields excoriating the court and the country for such an outrage against the scientific community, often accompanied by ominous warnings about the chilling effect this will have on the availability of expert advice in times of need.

Imaging and tracking the motion of single molecules on cell plasma membrane require high spatial resolution in three dimensions (3D). Fluorescence imaging along the axial dimension with nanometer resolution has been highly challenging but critical to revealing displacements in trans-membrane events. Here, utilizing a plasmonic ruler based on the sensitive distance dependence of near-infrared fluorescence enhancement (NIR-FE) of carbon nanotubes on a gold plasmonic substrate, we probe ~10 nm scale trans-membrane displacements through changes in nanotube fluorescence intensity, enabling observations of single nanotube endocytosis in 3D.

1204.5607,physics,"A detailed experimental and simulation study of the extraction of a 24 keV He-ion beam from an ECR ion source and the subsequent beam transport through an analyzing magnet is presented. We find that such a slow ion beam is very sensitive to space-charge forces, but also that the neutralization of the beam's space charge by secondary electrons is virtually complete for beam currents up to at least 0.5 mA. The beam emittance directly behind the extraction system is 65 pi mm mrad and is determined by the fact that the ion beam is extracted in the strong magnetic fringe field of the ion source. The relatively large emittance of the beam and its non-paraxiality lead, in combination with a relatively small magnet gap, to significant beam losses and a five-fold increase of the effective beam emittance during its transport through the analyzing magnet. The calculated beam profile and phase-space distributions in the image plane of the analyzing magnet agree well with measurements. The kinematic and magnet aberrations have been studied using the calculated second-order transfer map of the analyzing magnet, with which we can reproduce the phase-space distributions of the ion beam behind the analyzing magnet. Using the transfer map and trajectory calculations we have worked out an aberration compensation scheme based on the addition of compensating hexapole components to the main dipole field by modifying the shape of the poles. The simulations predict that by compensating the kinematic and geometric aberrations in this way and enlarging the pole gap the overall beam transport efficiency can be increased from 16 to 45%.",12,[],5

1204.1137,physics,"Secondary interventions after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms are frequent because stent-graft (SG) related complications may occur (mainly endoleak and SG thrombosis). Complications have been related to insufficient SG flexibility, especially when devices are deployed in tortuous arteries. Little is known on the relationship between SG design and flexibility. Therefore, the aim of this study was to simulate numerically the bending of two manufactured SGs (Aorfix-Lombard Medical (A) and Zenith-Cook Medical Europe (Z)) using finite element analysis (FEA). Global SG behavior was studied by assessing stent spacing variation and cross-section deformation. Four criteria were defined to compare flexibility of SGs: maximal luminal reduction rate, torque required for bending, maximal membrane strains in graft and maximal Von Mises stress in stents. For angulation greater than 60\degree, values of these four criteria were lower with A-SG, compared to Z-SG. In conclusion, A-SG was more flexible than Z-SG according to FEA. A-SG may decrease the incidence of complications in the setting of tortuous aorto-iliac aneurysms. Our numerical model could be used to assess flexibility of further manufactured as well as newly designed SGs.",12,[],5
1210.5416,physics,"We analyze the occurrence and the values of record-breaking temperatures in daily and monthly temperature observations. Our aim is to better understand and quantify the statistics of temperature records in the context of global warming. Similar to earlier work we employ a simple mathematical model of independent and identically distributed random variables with a linearly growing expectation value. This model proved to be useful in predicting the increase (decrease) in upper (lower) temperature records in a warming climate. Using both station and re-analysis data from Europe and the United States we further investigate the statistics of temperature records and the validity of this model. The most important new contribution in this article is an analysis of the statistics of record values for our simple model and European reanalysis data. We estimate how much the mean values and the distributions of record temperatures are affected by the large scale warming trend. In this context we consider both the values of records that occur at a certain time and the values of records that have a certain record number in the series of record events. We compare the observational data both to simple analytical computations and numerical simulations. We find that it is more difficult to describe the values of record breaking temperatures within the framework of our linear drift model. Observations from the summer months fit well into the model with Gaussian random variables under the observed linear warming, in the sense that record breaking temperatures are more extreme in the summer. In winter however a significant asymmetry of the daily temperature distribution hides the effect of the slow warming trends. Therefore very extreme cold records are still possible in winter. This effect is even more pronounced if one considers only data from subpolar regions.",12,[],5
1205.2071,physics,"Each observable ballistic phenomenon of a spin-stabilized rifle bullet can be explained in terms of the acceleration of gravity and the total aerodynamic force acting on that bullet. In addition to the coning motion itself, Coning Theory explains the spinning bullet's aerodynamic jump and its steadily increasing yaw of repose together with its resulting spin-drift. The total aerodynamic force on the bullet comprises its drag and lift rectangular components and produces an associated overturning moment acting upon the rigid bullet. The coning motion of the bullet includes two distinct but synchronized aspects: 1) the well-known gyroscopic precession of the spin-axis of the bullet, and 2) the previously little-known orbiting of the center of gravity of the bullet around its mean trajectory with the nose of the bullet angled inward toward that trajectory. New equations are developed governing the orbital motion of the CG as a circular, isotropic harmonic oscillation driven by the lift and drag forces as they revolve together at the gyroscopic precession rate. Standard Tri-Cyclic Theory governs the uniform circular precession of the spin-axis driven by the overturning moment acting on the spinning bullet as a free-flying gyroscope. The synchronization of these two motions is the defining principle of Coning Theory.",12,[],5

In a CPA, a lossy medium in an optical cavity with a specific degree of dissipation, equal in modulus to the gain of the lasing medium, can perfectly absorb coherent optical waves at discrete frequencies that are the time-reversed counterpart of the lasing modes. Here the concepts of time-reversal of lasing and CPA are extended for optical radiation emitted by a laser operated in an arbitrary (and generally highly-nonlinear) regime, i.e. for transient, chaotic or periodic coherent optical fields. We prove that any electromagnetic signal equation generated by a laser system \textbfS operated in an arbitrary regime can be perfectly absorbed by a CPA device equation which is simply realized by placing inside \textbfS a broadband linear absorber (attenuator) of appropriate transmittance. As examples, we discuss CPA devices that perfectly absorb a chaotic laser signal and a frequency-modulated optical wave.",12,[],5

When the strength of the buoyancy, thermocapillary effects and forced convective currents are comparable equation and equation, the results show that the development of instabilities in the form of steady longitudinal convective rolls is similar to those encountered in the Poiseuille-Rayleigh-B\'enard flow. The number and spatial distribution of these rolls along the channel depend on the flow conditions.

The restoration of this symmetry is shown to be independent of the geometry of the problem. These results provide a simple and powerful tool for the study of light-matter interactions within the framework of symmetries and conservation laws.

The conceptual framework aims at a parsimonious representation of a given climate phenomenon; the simulator-based framework connects physical and biogeochemical principles with phenomena at different spatial and temporal scales; and statistical modelling is a framework for inference from observations, given hypotheses on systematic and random effects. Recently, solutions have been proposed in the literature to combine these frameworks, and new concepts have emerged: the emulator (a statistical, computing efficient surrogate for the simulator) and the discrepancy, which is a statistical representation of the difference between the simulator and the real phenomenon.

1204.3011,physics,"A new approach, called Adaptive Q-control, for tapping-mode Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is introduced and implemented on a home-made AFM set-up utilizing a Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) and a piezo-actuated bimorph probe. In the standard Q-control, the effective Q-factor of the scanning probe is adjusted prior to the scanning depending on the application. However, there is a trade-off in setting the effective Q-factor of an AFM probe. The Q-factor is either increased to reduce the tapping forces or decreased to increase the maximum achievable scan speed. Realizing these two benefits simultaneously using the standard Q-control is not possible. In adaptive Q-control, the Q-factor of the probe is set to an initial value as in standard Q-control, but then modified on the fly during scanning when necessary to achieve this goal. In this paper, we present the basic theory behind the adaptive Q-control, the electronics enabling the on-line modification of the probe's effective Q-factor, and the results of the experiments comparing three different methods: scanning a) without Q-control, b) with the standard Q-control, and c) with the adaptive Q-control.

1205.2731,physics,"The way particles interact with turbulent structures, particularly in regions of high vorticity and strain rate, has been investigated in simulations of homogeneous turbulence and in simple flows which have a periodic or persistent structure e.g. separating flows and mixing layers. The influence on both settling under gravity and diffusion has been reported and the divergence (compressibility) of the underlying particle velocity field along a particle trajectory has been recognized as an important quantity in quantifying these features. This paper shows how these features can be incorporated in a formal way into a two-fluid model of the dispersed particle phase. In particular the PDF equation for the particle velocity and position is formerly derived on the basis of a stochastic process that involves the statistics of both the particle velocity and local compressibility along particle trajectories. The PDF equation gives rise to contributions to both the drift and particle diffusion coefficient that depend upon the correlation of these quantities with the local carrier flow velocity.

1209.0312,q-bio,"The Hox gene collinearity enigma has often been approached using models based on biomolecular mechanisms. The biophysical model, is an alternative approach, speculating that collinearity is caused by physical forces pulling the Hox clusters from a territory where they are inactive to a distinct spatial domain where they are activated in a step by step manner.   Hox gene translocations have recently been observed in support of the biophysical model. Furthermore, genetic engineering experiments, performed in embryonic mice, gave rise to some unexpected mutant expressions that biomolecular models could not predict. In several cases when anterior Hoxd genes are deleted, the expression of the genes whose expression is probed in the mutants are impossible to anticipate. On the contrary, the biophysical model offers convincing explanation.   All these experimental results support the idea of physical forces being responsible for Hox gene collinearity. In order to test the validity of the various models further, certain experiment involving gene deletions are proposed. The biophysical and biomolecular models predict different results for these experiments, hence the expected outcome will confirm or question the validity of these models.",12,[],10
1211.4911,q-bio,"Species interactions shape predator-prey networks, impacting community structure and, potentially, ecological dynamics. It is likely that global climatic perturbations that occur over long periods of time have a significant impact on species interactions patterns. However, observations of how these patterns change over time are typically limited to extant communities, which is particularly problematic for communities with long-lived species. Here we integrate stable isotope analysis and network theory to reconstruct patterns of trophic interactions for six independent mammalian communities that inhabited mammoth steppe environments spanning western Europe to eastern Alaska during the Pleistocene. We use a Bayesian mixing model to quantify the proportional contribution of prey to the diets of local predators, and assess how the structure of trophic interactions changed across space and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), a global climatic event that severely impacted mammoth steppe communities. We find that large felids had diets that were more constrained than other co-occurring predators, and largely influenced by an increase in \it Rangifer abundance after the LGM. Moreover, the structural organization of Beringian and European communities strongly differed: compared to Europe, species interactions in Beringian communities before the LGM were highly compartmentalized, or modular. This modularity was lost during the LGM, and partially recovered after the glacial retreat, and we suggest that changes in modularity among predators and prey may have been driven by geographic insularity.",12,[],10

For an auto-regulated gene, we show decoy sites decrease noise in the number of unbound proteins to a Poisson limit that results from binding and unbinding. This noise buffering is optimized for a given protein concentration when decoys have a 1/2 probability of being occupied. Decoys linearly increase the time to approach steady state and exponentially increase the time to switch epigenetically between bistable states.",12,[],10

It usually kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people and causes severe illness in millions more. Over the last century alone we have seen 3 global influenza pandemics. The great human and financial cost of this disease has made it the second most studied virus today, behind HIV. Recently, several genome-wide RNA interference studies have focused on identifying host molecules that participate in Influenza infection. We used nine of these studies for this meta-analysis. Even though the overlap among genes identified in multiple screens was small, network analysis indicates that similar protein complexes and biological functions of the host were present. As a result, several host gene complexes important for the Influenza virus life cycle were identified. The biological function and the relevance of each identified protein complex in the Influenza virus life cycle is further detailed in this paper.",12,[],10

The antagonistic properties of these isolates against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica and Bacillus cereus were examined using agar well diffusion method. Four LAB namely MF6, MF10, MF13, and MF15 identified as Lactobacillus animalis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus reuteri, respectively were effective against all selected pathogenic strains. Amongst the four isolates, MF6 exhibited the highest antibacterial activity, against all the indicator pathogens tested except Y. enterocolitic. Its activity was maximum against E.coli with a Zone of Inhibition (ZOI) ranging from 18.7 to 21.3 mm and least for Y. enterocolitica (10  1.1 mm). Isolate MF13 also showed antimicrobial property against all tested pathogens showing highest activity against Y. enterocolitica (14  1.7 mm) and least against E.coli (8  1.4 mm), which was in direct contrast to isolate MF6. Isolate MF15 showed greater activity against E.coli (12  0.8 mm) and least against S. aureus (8  1.7 mm). Least antimicrobial property was observed in isolate MF10, with a ZOI in the range of 2.5-7 mm. The degree of antimicrobial property among the isolates was in the order of MF6>MF13>MF15>MF10. Overall, the isolated LAB showed the remarkable inhibitory effect against both Gram positive and Gram negative pathogenic strains. However, the spectrum of inhibition was different for the isolates tested.

1212.5761,q-bio,"Leaf area LA, is a plant biometric index important to agroforestry and crop production. Previous works have demonstrated the conservativeness of the inverse of the product of the fresh leaf density and thickness, the so-called Hughes constant, K. We use this fact to develop LAMM, an absolute method of LA measurement, i.e. no regression fits or prior calibrations with planimeters. Nor does it require drying the leaves. The concept involves the in situ determination of K using geometrical shapes and their weights obtained from a subset of fresh leaves of the set whose areas are desired. Subsequently the LAs, at any desired stratification level, are derived by utilizing K and the previously measured masses of the fresh leaves. The concept was first tested in the simulated ideal case of complete planarity and uniform thickness by using plastic film covered card-paper sheets. Next the species-specific conservativeness of K over individual leaf zones and different leaf types from leaves of plants from two species, Mandevilla splendens and Spathiphyllum wallisii, was quantitatively validated. Using the global average K values, the LA of these and additional plants, were obtained. LAMM was found to be a rapid, simple, economic technique with accuracies, as measured for the geometrical shapes, that were comparable to those obtained by the planimetric method that utilizes digital image analysis, DIA. For the leaves themselves, there were no statistically significant differences between the LAs measured by LAMM and by the DIA and the linear correlation between the two methods was excellent.",12,[],10
1209.0426,q-bio,"We present a biophysical approach for the coupling of neural network activity as resulting from proper dipole currents of cortical pyramidal neurons to the electric field in extracellular fluid. Starting from a reduced threecompartment model of a single pyramidal neuron, we derive an observation model for dendritic dipole currents in extracellular space and thereby for the dendritic field potential that contributes to the local field potential of a neural population. This work aligns and satisfies the widespread dipole assumption that is motivated by the ""open-field"" configuration of the dendritic field potential around cortical pyramidal cells. Our reduced three-compartment scheme allows to derive networks of leaky integrate-and-fire models, which facilitates comparison with existing neural network and observation models. In particular, by means of numerical simulations we compare our approach with an ad hoc model by Mazzoni et al. [Mazzoni, A., S. Panzeri, N. K. Logothetis, and N. Brunel (2008).

In principle, the equations of that kind allow one to describe in the self consistent manner different processes of administration, distribution, metabolism and elimination of drugs. Moreover, it is possible to model different pharmacokinetic parameters of the non-compartmental pharmacokinetics and therefore to comment criticism of Rosigno.

1206.6768,q-bio,"Selective sweeps are typically associated with a local reduction of genetic diversity around the adaptive site. However, selective sweeps can also quickly carry neutral mutations to observable population frequencies if they arise early in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection coefficient of the sweep. Based on this result, we develop an estimator for the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the novel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on preexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination. Compared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the size of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator requires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth in order to capture low-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms standard approaches. We investigate analytically and numerically how the accuracy of our estimator is affected by the decay of the sweep pattern over time as a consequence of random genetic drift and discuss potential effects of recombination, soft sweeps, and demography. As an example for its use, we apply our estimator to deep sequencing data from HIV populations.",12,[],10

Here we report a case of global bifurcation triggered by gender that affects higher cognitive functions in humans. We report a cross-cultural study showing deviations in time perception, as assessed by estimating the duration of brief sounds, according to their durations and to the gender of the perciver. Results show that the duration of sounds lasting less than 10 s were on average overestimated, whereas those lasting longer were underestimated; estimates of sounds shorter than 1 s were extremely inaccurate. Females consistently gave longer estimates than males. Accuracy in time estimation was correlated to academic performance in disciplines requiring mathematical or scientific skills in male, but not in female students. This difference in correlation however had nothing to do with overall skills in mathematics. Both sexes scored similarly in scientific and technical disciplines, but females had higher grades than males in languages and lower ones in physical education.

1204.6020,q-bio,"Many viruses evolve rapidly. For example, hemagglutinin of the H3N2 influenza A virus evolves to escape antibody binding. This evolution of the H3N2 virus means that people who have previously been exposed to an influenza strain may be infected by a newly emerged virus. In this paper, we use Shannon entropy and relative entropy to measure the diversity and selection pressure by antibody in each amino acid site of H3 hemagglutinin between the 1992-1993 season and the 2009-2010 season. Shannon entropy and relative entropy are two independent state variables that we use to characterize H3N2 evolution. The entropy method estimates future H3N2 evolution and migration using currently available H3 hemagglutinin sequences. First, we show that the rate of evolution increases with the virus diversity in the current season. The Shannon entropy of the sequence in the current season predicts relative entropy between sequences in the current season and those in the next season. Second, a global migration pattern of H3N2 is assembled by comparing the relative entropy flows of sequences sampled in China, Japan, the USA, and Europe. We verify this entropy method by describing two aspects of historical H3N2 evolution. First, we identify 54 amino acid sites in hemagglutinin that have evolved in the past to evade the immune system. Second, the entropy method shows that epitopes A and B in the top of hemagglutinin evolve most vigorously to escape antibody binding. Our work provides a novel entropy-based method to predict and quantify future H3N2 evolution and to describe the evolutionary history of H3N2.",12,[],10
1211.0249,q-bio,"Simulation of extracellular fields is one of the substantial methods used in the area of computational neuroscience. Its most common usage is validation of experimental methods as EEG and extracellular spike recordings or modeling of physiological phenomena which can not be easily determined empirically. Continuous experimental work has been re-raising the importance of polarization effects between neuronal structures to neuronal communication. As this effects relies on very small potential changes, better modeling methods are necessary to quantify the weak electrical fields in the microscopic scale in a more realistic way. An important factor of influence on local field effects in the hippocampal formation is the heterogeneous resistivity of extracellular tissue. The vast majority of modeling studies consider the extracellular space to be homogeneous while experimentally, it has been shown that the stratum pyramidale has two times higher resistivity then other hippocampal layers. Common simulation methods for extracellular electrical fields based on the point source approximation are bound to describe the resistance of the space with a single, linear factor. We propose that models should be based on the space- and time-dependent Maxwell equations in order to account for heterogeneous properties of the extracellular space and specific arrangements of neurons in dense hippocampal layers. To demonstrate the influence of heterogeneous extracellular resistivity and neuronal spatial orientation on modeling results, we combine solutions of classical compartment models with spatiotemporal PDEs solved by the FEM. With the help of these methods, we show that the inclusion of heterogeneous resistivity has a substantial impact on voltages in close proximity to emitting neurons, increasing the extracellular potentials substantially compared to the homogeneous variant.",12,[],10

We analyzed panels of genetic reference populations and identified the MAs in each panel and the MA content (MAC) that each strain carried. We also analyzed 21 published GWAS datasets of human diseases and identified the MAC of each case or control. MAC was nearly linearly linked to quantitative variations in numerous traits in model organisms, including life span, tumor susceptibility, learning and memory, sensitivity to alcohol and anti-psychotic drugs, and two correlated traits poor reproductive fitness and strong immunity. Similarly, in Europeans or European Americans, enrichment of MAs of fast but not slow evolutionary rate was linked to autoimmune and numerous other diseases, including type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease, psychiatric disorders, alcohol and cocaine addictions, cancer, and less life span. Therefore, both high and low MAC correlated with extreme values in many traits, indicating stabilizing selection on most MAs.

1202.4335,q-bio,"In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and plant roots (Arabidopsis thaliana) zinc enters the cells via influx transporters of the ZIP family. Since zinc is both essential for cell function and toxic at high concentrations, tight regulation is essential for cell viability. We provide new insight into the underlying mechanisms, starting from a general model based on ordinary differential equations and adapting it to the specific cases of yeast and plant root cells. In yeast, zinc is transported by the transporters ZRT1 and ZRT2, which are both regulated by the zinc-responsive transcription factor ZAP1. Using biological data, parameters were estimated and analyzed, confirming the different affinities of ZRT1 and ZRT2 reported in the literature. Furthermore, our model suggests that the positive feedback in ZAP1 production has a stabilizing function at high influx rates. In plant roots, various ZIP transporters are involved in zinc uptake. Their regulation is largely unknown, but bZIP transcription factors are thought to be involved. We set up three putative models: activator only, activator with dimerization and activator/inhibitor.

Proposed approach is based on measurement and comparison of blank and analyzed sample evident features. In the first step of BBTA procedure, the number of compounds is reduced by max-to-mean ratio thresholding, which extensively reduce the computational time. Simple thresholding is followed by selection of time markers defined from blank inflex points which are then used for the transformation function, polynomial of second degree, in the example. BBTA approach was compared on real HPLC-MS measurement with Correlation Optimized Warping (COW) method. It was proved to have distinctively shorter computational time as well as lower level of mathematical presumptions. The BBTA is computationally much easier, quicker (more then 1000x) and accurate in comparison with warping. Moreover, markers selection works efficiently without any peak detection.

1206.3031,q-bio,"In molecular systematics, evolutionary trees are reconstructed from sequences at the tips under simple models of site substitution. A central question is how much sequence data is required to reconstruct a tree accurately? The answer depends on the lengths of the branches (edges) of the tree, with very short and very long edges requiring long sequences for accurate tree inference, particularly when these branch lengths are arranged in certain ways. For four-taxon trees, the sequence length question was settled for the case of a rapid speciation event in the distant past. Here, we generalize this result and show that the same sequence length requirement holds even when the speciation event is recent, provided that at least one of the four taxa is distantly related to the others. However, this equivalence disappears if a molecular clock applies, since the length of the long outgroup edge becomes largely irrelevant in the estimation of the tree topology for a recent (but not a deep) divergence.

Response kinetics were inversely proportional to Rac gradient values, in agreement with a new mathematical model, suggesting a role for natural input gradient amplification upstream of Rac. Increases in Rac levels beyond a well-defined threshold dramatically augmented polarization and decreased sensitivity to the gradient value. The threshold was governed by initial cell polarity and PI3K activity, supporting a role for both in defining responsiveness to natural or synthetic Rac activation.

We found that attractor solutions near symmetry breaking threshold predict a highly ordered map layout and require a substantial OD bias for OP pinwheel stabilization. Here we examine in numerical simulations whether such models exhibit biologically more realistic spatially irregular solutions at a finite distance from threshold and when transients towards attractor states are considered. We also examine whether model behavior qualitatively changes when the spatial periodicities of the two maps are detuned and when considering more than 2 feature dimensions.

1207.5159,q-bio,"Stimulus from the environment that guides behavior and informs decisions is encoded in the firing rates of neural populations. Each neuron in the populations, however, does not spike independently: spike events are correlated from cell to cell. To what degree does this apparent redundancy impact the accuracy with which decisions can be made, and the computations that are required to optimally decide? We explore these questions for two illustrative models of correlation among cells. Each model is statistically identical at the level of pairs cells, but differs in higher-order statistics that describe the simultaneous activity of larger cell groups. We find that the presence of correlations can diminish the performance attained by an ideal decision maker to either a small or large extent, depending on the nature of the higher-order interactions. Moreover, while this optimal performance can in some cases be obtained via the standard integration-to-bound operation, in others it requires a nonlinear computation on incoming spikes. Overall, we conclude that a given level of pairwise correlations--even when restricted to identical neural populations--may not always indicate redundancies that diminish decision making performance.",12,[],10

Most of these reports involve either indirect measurements of KYNA effects on \alpha7 nAChR function, or are reports of KYNA effects in complicated in vivo systems. However, a recent report investigating KYNA interactions with \alpha7 nAChRs failed to detect an interaction using direct measurements of \alpha7 nAChRs function. Further, it showed that a KYNA blockade of \alpha7 nAChR stimulated GABA release (an indirect measure of \alpha7 nAChR function) was not due to KYNA blockade of the \alpha7 nAChRs. The current study measured the direct effects of KYNA on \alpha7-containing nAChRs expressed on interneurons in the hilar and CA1 stratum radiatum regions of the mouse hippocampus and on interneurons in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus.

1206.4361,q-bio,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited degenerative eye diseases characterized by mutations in the genetic structure of the photoreceptors that leads to the premature death of both rod and cone photoreceptors. Defects in particular genes encoding proteins that are involved in either the photoreceptor structure, phototransduction cascades, or visual cycle are expressed in the rods but ultimately affect both types of cells. RP is ""typically"" manifested by a steady death of rods followed by a period of stability in which cones survive initially and then inevitably die too. In some RP cases, rods and cones die off simultaneously or even cone death precedes rod death (reverse RP). The mechanisms and factors involved in the development of the different types of RP are not well understood nor have researchers been able to provide more than a limited number of short-term therapies. In this work we trace the progression of RP to complete blindness through each subtype via bifurcation theory. We show that the evolution of RP from one stage to another often requires the failure of multiple components. Our results indicate that a delicate balance between the availability of nutrients and the rates of shedding and renewal of photoreceptors is needed at every stage of RP to halt its progression. This work provides a framework for future physiological investigations potentially leading to long-term targeted multi-facet interventions and therapies dependent on the particular stage and subtype of RP under consideration.

The removal of these sequences prior to assembly results in similar assembly content for most metagenomes and enables the use of graph partitioning to decrease assembly memory and time requirements.",12,[],10
1203.0971,q-bio,"We measured mobility patterns that describe walking trajectories of individual Me'Phaa peasants searching and collecting fuelwood in the forests of ""La Monta\~na de Guerrero"" in Mexico. These one-day excursions typically follow a mixed pattern of nearly-constant steps when individuals displace from their homes towards potential collecting sites and a mixed pattern of steps of different lengths when actually searching for fallen wood in the forest. Displacements in the searching phase seem not to be compatible with L\'evy flights described by power-laws with optimal scaling exponents. These findings however can be interpreted in the light of deterministic searching on heavily degraded landscapes where the interaction of the individuals with their scarce environment produces alternative searching strategies than the expected L\'evy flights. These results have important implications for future management and restoration of degraded forests and the improvement of the ecological services they may provide to their inhabitants.",12,[],10
1203.0872,q-bio,"Extracellular recordings of single neurons in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices of monkeys in vivo have shown that their firing rate can increase, decrease, or remain constant in different cells, as the external stimulus frequency increases. We observed similar intrinsic firing patterns (increasing, decreasing or constant) in rat somatosensory cortex in vitro, when stimulated with oscillatory input using conductance injection (dynamic clamp). The underlying mechanism of this observation is not obvious, and presents a challenge for mathematical modelling. We propose a simple principle for describing this phenomenon using a leaky integrate-and-fire model with sinusoidal input, an intrinsic oscillation and Poisson noise. Additional enhancement of the gain of encoding could be achieved by local network connections amongst diverse intrinsic response patterns. Our work sheds light on the possible cellular and network mechanisms underlying these opposing neuronal responses, which serve to enhance signal detection.",12,[],10
1207.1228,q-bio,"Many stochastic systems in physics and biology are investigated by recording the two-dimensional (2D) positions of a moving test particle in regular time intervals. The resulting sample trajectories are then used to induce the properties of the underlying stochastic process. Often, it can be assumed a priori that the underlying discrete-time random walk model is independent from absolute position (homogeneity), direction (isotropy) and time (stationarity), as well as ergodic. In this article we first review some common statistical methods for analyzing 2D trajectories, based on quantities with built-in rotational invariance. We then discuss an alternative approach in which the two-dimensional trajectories are reduced to one dimension by projection onto an arbitrary axis and rotational averaging. Each step of the resulting 1D trajectory is further factorized into sign and magnitude. The statistical properties of the signs and magnitudes are mathematically related to those of the step lengths and turning angles of the original 2D trajectories, demonstrating that no essential information is lost by this data reduction. The resulting binary sequence of signs lends itself for a pattern counting analysis, revealing temporal properties of the random process that are not easily deduced from conventional measures such as the velocity autocorrelation function. In order to highlight this simplified 1D description, we apply it to a 2D random walk with restricted turning angles (RTA model), defined by a finite-variance distribution equation of step length and a narrow turning angle distribution equation, assuming that the lengths and directions of the steps are independent.",12,[],10
1204.2945,q-bio,"In dynamical models of cortical networks, the recurrent connectivity can amplify the input given to the network in two distinct ways. One is induced by the presence of near-critical eigenvalues in the connectivity matrix W, producing large but slow activity fluctuations along the corresponding eigenvectors (dynamical slowing). The other relies on W being nonnormal, which allows the network activity to make large but fast excursions along specific directions. Here we investigate the tradeoff between nonnormal amplification and dynamical slowing in the spontaneous activity of large random neuronal networks composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We use a Schur decomposition of W to separate the two amplification mechanisms. Assuming linear stochastic dynamics, we derive an exact expression for the expected amount of purely nonnormal amplification. We find that amplification is very limited if dynamical slowing must be kept weak. We conclude that, to achieve strong transient amplification with little slowing, the connectivity must be structured. We show that unidirectional connections between neurons of the same type together with reciprocal connections between neurons of different types, allow for amplification already in the fast dynamical regime. Finally, our results also shed light on the differences between balanced networks in which inhibition exactly cancels excitation, and those where inhibition dominates.",12,[],10

Substantial data on BSCs have been accumulated in the field of molecular biology and the analysis of signaling systems requires qualitative evaluation. However, quantification of the information and channel capacity of BSCs has not been focused on from the perspective of information theory. In the current study, we aimed to derive basic equations for describing the channel capacity and information density of BSCs using the fluctuation theorem. From the results, channel capacity and information density can be described using the average entropy production rate when the signaling system is minimally redundant. The channel capacity could actually be calculated for the mitogen-activated protein kinase BSC when it was minimally redundant. This quantitative method of examination is applicable to the quantitative analysis of BSCs.",12,[],10

1208.3381,q-bio,"Positive selection distorts the structure of genealogies and hence alters patterns of genetic variation within a population. Most analyses of these distortions focus on the signatures of hitchhiking due to hard or soft selective sweeps at a single genetic locus. However, in linked regions of rapidly adapting genomes, multiple beneficial mutations at different loci can segregate simultaneously within the population, an effect known as clonal interference. This leads to a subtle interplay between hitchhiking and interference effects, which leads to a unique signature of rapid adaptation on genetic variation both at the selected sites and at linked neutral loci. Here, we introduce an effective coalescent theory (a ""fitness-class coalescent"") that describes how positive selection at many perfectly linked sites alters the structure of genealogies. We use this theory to calculate several simple statistics describing genetic variation within a rapidly adapting population, and to implement efficient backwards-time coalescent simulations which can be used to predict how clonal interference alters the expected patterns of molecular evolution.",12,[],10
1207.5684,q-bio,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1 or simply HIV) induces a persistent infection, which in the absence of treatment leads to AIDS and death in almost all infected individuals. HIV infection elicits a vigorous immune response starting about 2-3 weeks post infection that can lower the amount of virus in the body, but which cannot eradicate the virus. How HIV establishes a chronic infection in the face of a strong immune response remains poorly understood. It has been shown that HIV is able to rapidly change its proteins via mutation to evade recognition by virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Typically, an HIV-infected patient will generate 4-12 CTL responses specific for parts of viral proteins called epitopes. Such CTL responses lead to strong selective pressure to change the viral sequences encoding these epitopes so as to avoid CTL recognition. Here we review experimental data on HIV evolution in response to CTL pressure, mathematical models developed to explain this evolution, and highlight problems associated with the data and previous modeling efforts. We show that estimates of the strength of the epitope-specific CTL response depend on the method used to fit models to experimental data and on the assumptions made regarding how mutants are generated during infection. We illustrate that allowing CTL responses to decay over time may improve the fit to experimental data and provides higher estimates of the killing efficacy of HIV-specific CTLs. We also propose a novel method for simultaneously estimating the killing efficacy of multiple CTL populations specific for different epitopes of HIV using stochastic simulations. Lastly, we show that current estimates of the efficacy at which HIV-specific CTLs clear virus-infected cells can be improved by more frequent sampling of viral sequences and by combining data on sequence evolution with experimentally measured CTL dynamics.",12,[],10
1212.0413,q-bio,"Viroids are small circular single-stranded infectious RNAs that are characterized by a relatively high mutation level. Knowledge of their sequence heterogeneity remains largely elusive, and, as yet, no strategy attempting to address this question from a population dynamics point of view is in place. In order to address these important questions, a GF305 indicator peach tree was infected with a single variant of the Avsunviroidae family member Peach latent mosaic viroid (PLMVd). Six months post-inoculation, full-length circular conformers of PLMVd were isolated, deep-sequenced and the resulting sequences analyzed using an original bioinformatics scheme specifically designed and developed in order to evaluate the richness of a given the sequence's population. Two distinct libraries were analyzed, and yielded 1125 and 1061 different PLMVd variants respectively, making this study the most productive to date (by more than an order of magnitude) in terms of the reporting of novel viroid sequences. Sequence variants exhibiting up to ~20% of mutations relative to the inoculated viroid were retrieved, clearly illustrating the high divergence dynamic inside a unique population. Using a novel hierarchical clustering algorithm, the different variants obtained were grouped into either 7 or 8 clusters depending on the library being analyzed. Most of the sequences contained, on average, between 4.6 and 6.3 mutations relative to the variant used initially to inoculate the plant. Interestingly, it was possible to reconstitute the sequence evolution between these clusters. On top of providing a reliable pipeline for the treatment of viroid deep-sequencing, this study sheds new light on the importance of the sequence variation that may take place in a viroid population and which may result in the formation of a quasi-species.",12,[],10
1210.0120,q-bio,"Ray-finned fishes constitute the dominant radiation of vertebrates with over 30,000 species. Although molecular phylogenetics has begun to disentangle major evolutionary relationships within this vast section of the Tree of Life, there is no widely available approach for efficiently collecting phylogenomic data within fishes, leaving much of the enormous potential of massively parallel sequencing technologies for resolving major radiations in ray-finned fishes unrealized. Here, we provide a genomic perspective on longstanding questions regarding the diversification of major groups of ray-finned fishes through targeted enrichment of ultraconserved nuclear DNA elements (UCEs) and their flanking sequence. Our workflow efficiently and economically generates data sets that are orders of magnitude larger than those produced by traditional approaches and is well-suited to working with museum specimens. Analysis of the UCE data set recovers a well-supported phylogeny at both shallow and deep time-scales that supports a monophyletic relationship between Amia and Lepisosteus (Holostei) and reveals elopomorphs and then osteoglossomorphs to be the earliest diverging teleost lineages. Divergence time estimation based upon 14 fossil calibrations reveals that crown teleosts appeared ~270 Ma at the end of the Permian and that elopomorphs, osteoglossomorphs, ostarioclupeomorphs, and euteleosts diverged from one another by 205 Ma during the Triassic. Our approach additionally reveals that sequence capture of UCE regions and their flanking sequence offers enormous potential for resolving phylogenetic relationships within ray-finned fishes.",12,[],10

1212.0790,q-bio,"The evolution of parasite virulence and host defences is affected by population structure. This effect has been confirmed in studies focusing on large spatial scales, whereas the importance of local structure is not well understood. Slavemaking ants are social parasites that exploit workers of another species to rear their offspring. Enslaved workers of the host species Temnothorax longispinosus have been found to exhibit an effective post-enslavement defence behaviour: enslaved workers were observed killing a large proportion of the parasites' offspring. Since enslaved workers do not reproduce, they gain no direct fitness benefit from this 'rebellion' behaviour. However, there may be an indirect benefit: neighbouring host nests that are related to 'rebel' nests can benefit from a reduced raiding pressure, as a result of the reduction in parasite nest size due to the enslaved workers' killing behaviour. We use a simple mathematical model to examine whether the small-scale population structure of the host species could explain the evolution of this potentially altruistic defence trait against slavemaking ants. We find that this is the case if enslaved host workers are related to nearby host nests. In a population genetic study we confirm that enslaved workers are, indeed, more closely related to host nests within the raiding range of their resident slavemaker nest, than to host nests outside the raiding range. This small-scale population structure seems to be a result of polydomy (e.g. the occupation of several nests in close proximity by a single colony) and could have enabled the evolution of 'rebellion' by kin selection.",12,[],10

1203.4625,q-bio,"Many models for the origin of life have focused on understanding how evolution can drive the refinement of a preexisting enzyme, such as the evolution of efficient replicase activity. Here we present a model for what was, arguably, an even earlier stage of chemical evolution, when polymer sequence diversity was generated and sustained before, and during, the onset of functional selection. The model includes regular environmental cycles (e.g. hydration-dehydration cycles) that drive polymers between times of replication and functional activity, which coincide with times of different monomer and polymer diffusivity. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that this proposed prebiotic scenario provides a robust mechanism for the exploration of sequence space. Introduction of a polymer sequence with monomer synthetase activity illustrates that functional sequences can become established in a preexisting pool of otherwise non-functional sequences. Functional selection does not dominate system dynamics and sequence diversity remains high, permitting the emergence and spread of more than one functional sequence. It is also observed that polymers spontaneously form clusters in simulations where polymers diffuse more slowly than monomers, a feature that is reminiscent of a previous proposal that the earliest stages of life could have been defined by the collective evolution of a system-wide cooperation of polymer aggregates. Overall, the results presented demonstrate the merits of considering plausible prebiotic polymer chemistries and environments that would have allowed for the rapid turnover of monomer resources and for regularly varying monomer/polymer diffusivities.",12,[],10
1212.5010,q-bio,"Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) is one of the most important points, in majority of apoptotic signaling cascades. Decision mechanism controlling whether the MOMP occurs or not, is formed by an interplay between members of the Bcl-2 family. To understand the role of individual members of this family within the MOMP regulation, we constructed a boolean network-based mathematical model of interactions between the Bcl-2 proteins. Results of computational simulations reveal the existence of the potentially malign configurations of activities of the Bcl-2 proteins, blocking the occurrence of MOMP, independently of the incoming stimuli. Our results suggest role of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 in relation to these configurations. We demonstrate here, the importance of the Bid and Bim according to activation of effectors Bax and Bak, and the irreversibility of this activation. The model further shows the distinct requirements for effectors activation, where the antiapoptic protein Bcl-w is seemingly a key factor preventing the Bax activation. We believe that this work may help to describe the functioning of the Bcl-2 regulation of MOMP better, and hopefully provide some contribution regarding the anti-cancer drug development research.",12,[],10
1201.5364,q-bio,"A simple way to model phenotypic evolution is to assume that after splitting, the trait values of the sister species diverge as independent Brownian motions. Relying only on a prior distribution for the underlying species tree (conditioned on the number, n, of extant species) we study the random vector (X1,...,Xn) of the observed trait values. In this paper we derive compact formulae for the variance of the sample mean and the mean of the sample variance for the vector (X1,...,Xn).   The key ingredient of these formulae is the correlation coefficient between two trait values randomly chosen from (X1,...,Xn). This interspecies correlation coefficient takes into account not only variation due to the random sampling of two species out of n and the stochastic nature of Brownian motion but also the uncertainty in the phylogenetic tree. The latter is modeled by a (supercritical or critical) conditioned branching process. In the critical case we modify the Aldous-Popovic model by assuming a proper prior for the time of origin.",12,[],10

We found that almost half the genes, about which we can make strong statements, have bacterial ancestry and are likely a result of multiple horizontal transfer events. Futhermore their functions specifically relate to the phenotypic changes required for a chemolithotroph to become a heterotroph.

1208.3225,q-bio,"An early burst of speciation followed by a subsequent slowdown in the rate of diversification is commonly inferred from molecular phylogenies. This pattern is consistent with some verbal theory of ecological opportunity and adaptive radiations. One often-overlooked source of bias in these studies is that of sampling at the level of whole clades, as researchers tend to choose large, speciose clades to study. In this paper, we investigate the performance of common methods across the distribution of clade sizes that can be generated by a constant-rate birth-death process. Clades which are larger than expected for a given constant-rate branching process tend to show a pattern of an early burst even when both speciation and extinction rates are constant through time. All methods evaluated were susceptible to detecting this false signature when extinction was low. Under moderate extinction, both the gamma-statistic and diversity-dependent models did not detect such a slowdown but only because the signature of a slowdown was masked by subsequent extinction. Some models which estimate time-varying speciation rates are able to detect early bursts under higher extinction rates, but are extremely prone to sampling bias. We suggest that examining clades in isolation may result in spurious inferences that rates of diversification have changed through time.",12,[],10
1208.0537,q-bio,"Transcriptional regulatory network inference methods have been studied for years. Most of them relie on complex mathematical and algorithmic concepts, making them hard to adapt, re-implement or integrate with other methods. To address this problem, we introduce a novel method based on a minimal statistical model for observing transcriptional regulatory interactions in noisy expression data, which assumes that transcription factors (TFs) and their targets are both differentially expressed in a gene-specific, critical sample contrast, as measured by repeated two-way t-tests. This method is conceptually simple and easy to implement and integrate in any statistical software environment. Benchmarking on standard E. coli and yeast reference datasets showed that it performs equally well as the best existing methods. Analysis of the predicted interactions suggested that it works best to infer context-specific TF-target interactions which only co-express locally. We confirmed this hypothesis on a dataset of more than 1,000 normal human tissue samples, where we found that our method predicts highly tissue-specific and functionally relevant interactions, whereas a global co-expression method only associates general TFs to non-specific biological processes.",12,[],10
1202.1300,q-bio,"We developed mathematical models that simulate community dynamics derived from a series of perturbation experiments. These experiments were performed in an Atlantic Forest stream. The three trophic level community was submitted to two combinations of press perturbation experiment. In the first, the top trophic level was removed by electrical exclusion. In the second configuration, the top trophic level was still excluded plus a group of species from the second trophic level was inhibited, also by electrical pulses. Experiments were repeated at different times to increase confidence in the observed mechanisms. Community responses indicated the existence of cascading interactions similar to a classic trophic cascade. The community was composed of Macrobrachium shrimps at the top trophic level, Ephemeroptera and Chironomidae larval insects at the second trophic level and periphyton (= epilithon = biofilm) at the first trophic level. The shrimp exclusion caused an increase in ephemeropterans and chironomids and led the periphyton to decrease in the exclusion zone. When ephemeropterans were inhibited together with the exclusion of shrimps, the chironomids and the periphyton increased. We modelled the community interactions by means of differential equation systems, simulating the three configurations: 1. natural condition, 2. shrimp exclusion condition and 3. shrimp-exclusion-plus-ephemeropteran-inhibition condition. All parameters were calculated via experimental results and the stability of the models was determined by their matrix eigenvalues.

1212.5239,q-bio,"An important question in molecular evolution is whether an amino acid that occurs at a given position makes an independent contribution to fitness, or whether its effect depends on the state of other loci in the organism's genome, a phenomenon known as epistasis. In a recent letter to Nature, Breen et al. (2012) argued that epistasis must be ""pervasive throughout protein evolution"" because the observed ratio between the per-site rates of non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) is much lower than would be expected in the absence of epistasis. However, when calculating the expected dN/dS ratio in the absence of epistasis, Breen et al. assumed that all amino acids observed in a protein alignment at any particular position have equal fitness. Here, we relax this unrealistic assumption and show that any dN/dS value can in principle be achieved at a site, without epistasis.

1203.1471,q-bio,"Constraints in embryonic development are thought to bias the direction of evolution by making some changes less likely, and others more likely, depending on their consequences on ontogeny. Here, we characterize the constraints acting on genome evolution in vertebrates. We used gene expression data from two vertebrates: zebrafish, using a microarray experiment spanning 14 stages of development, and mouse, using EST counts for 26 stages of development. We show that, in both species, genes expressed early in development (1) have a more dramatic effect of knock-out or mutation and (2) are more likely to revert to single copy after whole genome duplication, relative to genes expressed late. This supports high constraints on early stages of vertebrate development, making them less open to innovations (gene gain or gene loss). Results are robust to different sources of data-gene expression from microarrays, ESTs, or in situ hybridizations; and mutants from directed KO, transgenic insertions, point mutations, or morpholinos. We determine the pattern of these constraints, which differs from the model used to describe vertebrate morphological conservation (""hourglass"" model).

Here we show that, even though many proteins affect smooth muscle formation and the expression of Vegfa, an inducer of blood vessel formation, it is sufficient to add FGF9 to the FGF10/SHH/Ptc module to successfully predict simultaneously the emergence of smooth muscles in the clefts between growing lung buds, and Vegfa expression in the distal sub-epithelial mesenchyme.

1208.1092,q-bio,"The question of Jewish ancestry has been the subject of controversy for over two centuries and has yet to be resolved. The ""Rhineland Hypothesis"" proposes that Eastern European Jews emerged from a small group of German Jews who migrated eastward and expanded rapidly. Alternatively, the ""Khazarian Hypothesis"" suggests that Eastern European descended from Judean tribes who joined the Khazars, an amalgam of Turkic clans that settled the Caucasus in the early centuries CE and converted to Judaism in the 8th century. The Judaized Empire was continuously reinforced with Mesopotamian and Greco-Roman Jews until the 13th century. Following the collapse of their empire, the Judeo-Khazars fled to Eastern Europe. The rise of European Jewry is therefore explained by the contribution of the Judeo-Khazars. Thus far, however, their contribution has been estimated only empirically; the absence of genome-wide data from Caucasus populations precluded testing the Khazarian Hypothesis. Recent sequencing of modern Caucasus populations prompted us to revisit the Khazarian Hypothesis and compare it with the Rhineland Hypothesis. We applied a wide range of population genetic analyses - including principal component, biogeographical origin, admixture, identity by descent, allele sharing distance, and uniparental analyses - to compare these two hypotheses. Our findings support the Khazarian Hypothesis and portray the European Jewish genome as a mosaic of Caucasus, European, and Semitic ancestries, thereby consolidating previous contradictory reports of Jewish ancestry.",12,[],10
1201.2045,q-bio,"Using digitized images of the three-dimensional, branching structures for root systems of bean seedlings, together with analytical and numerical methods that map a common 'SIR' epidemiological model onto the bond percolation problem, we show how the spatially-correlated branching structures of plant roots affect transmission efficiencies, and hence the invasion criterion, for a soil-borne pathogen as it spreads through ensembles of morphologically complex hosts. We conclude that the inherent heterogeneities in transmissibilities arising from correlations in the degrees of overlap between neighbouring plants, render a population of root systems less susceptible to epidemic invasion than a corresponding homogeneous system. Several components of morphological complexity are analysed that contribute to disorder and heterogeneities in transmissibility of infection. Anisotropy in root shape is shown to increase resilience to epidemic invasion, while increasing the degree of branching enhances the spread of epidemics in the population of roots. Some extension of the methods for other epidemiological systems are discussed.",12,[],10
1202.4868,q-bio,"Introduction : Mass spectrometry approaches are very attractive to detect protein panels in a sensitive and high speed way. MS can be coupled to many proteomic separation techniques. However, controlling technological variability on these analytical chains is a critical point. Adequate information processing is mandatory for data analysis to take into account the complexity of the analysed mixture, to improve the measurement reliability and to make the technology user friendly. Therefore we develop a hierarchical parametric probabilistic model of the LC-MS analytical chain including the technological variability. We introduce a Bayesian reconstruction methodology to recover the protein biomarkers content in a robust way. We will focus on the digestion step since it brings a major contribution to technological variability. Method : In this communication, we introduce a hierarchical model of the LC-MS analytical chain. Such a chain is a cascade of molecular events depicted by a graph structure, each node being associated to a molecular state such as protein, peptide and ion and each branch to a molecular processing such as digestion, ionisation and LC-MS separation. This molecular graph defines a hierarchical mixture model. We extend the Bayesian statistical framework we have introduced previously [1] to this hierarchical description. As an example, we will consider the digestion step. We describe the digestion process on a pair of peptides within the targeted protein as a Bernoulli random process associated with a cleavage probability controlled by the digestion kinetic law.",12,[],10
1210.8088,q-bio,"When small RNAs are loaded onto Argonaute proteins they can form the RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), which mediate RNA interference. RISC-formation is dependent on a shared pool of Argonaute proteins and RISC loading factors, and is thus susceptible to competition among small RNAs for loading. We present a mathematical model that aims to understand how small RNA competition for the PTR resources affects target gene repression. We discuss that small RNA activity is limited by RISC-formation, RISC-degradation and the availability of Argonautes. Together, these observations explain a number of PTR saturation effects encountered experimentally. We show that different competition conditions for RISC-loading result in different signatures of PTR activity determined also by the amount of RISC-recycling taking place. In particular, we find that the small RNAs less efficient at RISC-formation, using fewer resources of the PTR pathway, can perform in the low RISC-recycling range equally well as their more effective counterparts. Additionally, we predict a novel signature of PTR in target expression levels. Under conditions of low RISC-loading efficiency and high RISC-recycling, the variation in target levels increases linearly with the target transcription rate. Furthermore, we show that RISC-recycling determines the effect that Argonaute scarcity conditions have on target expression variation. Our observations taken together offer a framework of predictions which can be used in order to infer from experimental data the particular characteristics of underlying PTR activity.",12,[],10
1211.5633,q-bio,"Finite dynamical systems (e.g. Boolean networks and logical models) have been used in modeling biological systems to focus attention on the qualitative features of the system, such as the wiring diagram. Since the analysis of such systems is hard, it is necessary to focus on subclasses that have the properties of being general enough for modeling and simple enough for theoretical analysis. In this paper we propose the class of AND-NOT networks for modeling biological systems and show that it provides several advantages. Some of the advantages include: Any finite dynamical system can be written as an AND-NOT network with similar dynamical properties. There is a one-to-one correspondence between AND-NOT networks, their wiring diagrams, and their dynamics. Results about AND-NOT networks can be stated at the wiring diagram level without losing any information. Results about AND-NOT networks are applicable to any Boolean network.

1210.2908,q-bio,"Complex networks have been shown to be robust against random structural perturbations, but vulnerable against targeted attacks. Robustness analysis usually simulates the removal of individual or sets of nodes, followed by the assessment of the inflicted damage. For complex metabolic networks, it has been suggested that evolutionary pressure may favor robustness against reaction removal. However, the removal of a reaction and its impact on the network may as well be interpreted as selective regulation of pathway activities, suggesting a tradeoff between the efficiency of regulation and vulnerability. Here, we employ a cascading failure algorithm to simulate the removal of single and pairs of reactions from the metabolic networks of two organisms, and estimate the significance of the results using two different null models: degree preserving and mass-balanced randomization. Our analysis suggests that evolutionary pressure promotes larger cascades of non-viable reactions, and thus favors the ability of efficient metabolic regulation at the expense of robustness.",12,[],10

In four additional subjects, we injected fluorophor-conjugated CTB in both eyes, using a different fluorophor in each eye. Brains of these subjects were fixed and sectioned, and the labeled retinal ganglion cell termini were imaged with wide-field sub-micron resolution slide scanners. Retinal termination zones were traced to reconstruct a three dimensional model of the ipsilateral and contralateral retinal termination zones in the dLGN on both sides of the brain. The dLGN volume was 1.58 0.094 mm3, comprising 70  3% the volume of the entire retinorecipient LGN. We find the retinal terminals to be well-segregated by eye of origin.

1211.6397,q-bio,"Until recently many studies of bone remodeling at the cellular level have focused on the behavior of mature osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and their respective precursor cells, with the role of osteocytes and bone lining cells left largely unexplored. This is particularly true with respect to the mathematical modeling of bone remodeling. However, there is increasing evidence that osteocytes play important roles in the cycle of targeted bone remodeling, in serving as a significant source of RANKL to support osteoclastogenesis, and in secreting the bone formation inhibitor sclerostin. Moreover, there is also increasing interest in sclerostin, an osteocyte-secreted bone formation inhibitor, and its role in regulating local response to changes in the bone microenvironment. Here we develop a cell population model of bone remodeling that includes the role of osteocytes, sclerostin, and allows for the possibility of RANKL expression by osteocyte cell populations. This model extends and complements many of the existing mathematical models for bone remodeling but can be used to explore aspects of the process of bone remodeling that were previously beyond the scope of prior modeling work. Through numerical simulations we demonstrate that our model can be used to theoretically explore many of the most recent experimental results for bone remodeling, and can be utilized to assess the effects of novel bone-targeting agents on the bone remodeling process.",12,[],10
1211.4210,q-bio,"Trypanosoma cruzi and Giardia intestinalis are two human pathogens and protozoan parasites responsible for the diseases Chagas disease and giardiasis, respectively. Both diseases cause suffering and illness in several million individuals. The former disease occurs primarily in South America and Central America, and the latter disease occurs worldwide. Current therapeutics are toxic and lack efficacy, and potential vaccines are far from the market.

We perform quantum catalysis experimentally, showing tunability into the nonclassical regime. Our protocol is not limited by weak nonlinearities that underlie most known strategies of preparing multi-photon nonclassical states.

We study the influence of avoided level crossings onto four overlapping complex eigenvalues of a symmetric non-Hermitian operator. The mixing of the two wavefunctions around equation is simulated, in each case, by assuming a Gaussian distribution around equation. At high level density, the Gaussian distributions related to avoided crossings of different levels may overlap.

Tunneling is closely related to splitting of the ground state energy which is degenerate in the classical limit. In this thesis we use two methods to estimate the energy splitting in one dimensional quantum mechanics. In semi-classical approximation the splitting is calculated in the weak coupling limit. The other approach, Tamm-Dancoff method gives very precise numerical results for finite coupling. Comparing these two approaches we are able to confirm results of the semi-classical approximation and determine range of its applicability.

Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that as the reference direction degrades the probability of violating a Bell inequality decreases smoothly to (39.7 /- 0.1) % in the limiting case that the observers do not share a reference direction.

Long-range dipolar couplings induce a finite intrinsic lifetime for the mediating eigenmode; extensive numerical simulations of dipolar chains of lengths up to L=12 show remarkably high fidelity despite these decay processes. We further consider the extension of the protocol to bosonic systems of coupled oscillators. Second, we introduce a quantum mirror based architecture for universal quantum computing which exploits all of the spins in the system as potential qubits. While this dramatically increases the number of qubits available, the composite operations required to manipulate ""dark"" spin qubits significantly raise the error threshold for robust operation.

Previous work has already demonstrated analytically that two-particle non-interacting quantum walks cannot distinguish non-isomorphic SRGs of the same family. Here, we demonstrate numerically that three-particle non-interacting quantum walks have significant, but not universal, distinguishing power for pairs of SRGs, proving a fundamental difference between the distinguishing power of two-particle and three-particle non-interacting walks. We analytically show why this distinguishing power is possible, whereas it is forbidden for two-particle non-interacting walks. Based on sampling of SRGs with up to 64 vertices, we find no difference in the distinguishing power of bosonic and fermionic walks. In addition, we find that the four-fermion non-interacting walk has greater distinguishing power than the three-particle walks on SRGs, showing that increasing particle number increases distinguishing power. However, we also analytically show that no non-interacting walk with a fixed number of particles can distinguish all SRGs, thus demonstrating a potential fundamental difference between the distinguishing power of interacting and noninteracting walks.",12,[],6
1202.5779,quant-ph,"The construction and operation of large scale quantum information devices presents a grand challenge. A major issue is the effective control of coherent evolution, which requires accurate knowledge of the system dynamics that may vary from device to device.

1202.6100,quant-ph,"In this paper we describe a scheme for state transfer between a trapped atomic Bose condensate and an optomechanical end-mirror mediated by a cavity field. Coupling between the mirror and the cold gas arises from the fact that the cavity field can produce density oscillations in the gas which in turn acts as an internal Bragg mirror for the field. After adiabatic elimination of the cavity field we find that the hybrid system of the gas and mirror is described by a beam splitter Hamiltonian that allows for state transfer, but only if the quantum nature of the cavity field is retained.",12,[],6

Using quantum correlations with an ancilla qubit, DCQD reduces exponentially the number of experimental configurations required for standard QPT. With this technique, the system's relaxation times T1 and T2 were measured with a single experimental configuration.

1201.3387,quant-ph,"We consider whether or not Hamiltonians which are sums of commuting projectors have ""trivial"" ground states which can be constructed by a local quantum circuit of bounded depth and range acting on a product state. While the toric code only has nontrivial ground states, commuting projector Hamiltonians which are sums of two-body interactions have trivial ground states.   We define an ""interaction complex"" for a Hamiltonian, generalizing the interaction graph, and we show that if this complex can be continuously mapped to a 1-complex using a map with bounded diameter of pre-images then the Hamiltonian has a trivial ground state assuming one technical condition on the Hamiltonian (this condition holds for all stabilizer Hamiltonians, and we also prove the result for all Hamiltonians under an assumption on the 1-complex). While this includes cases considered by Ref., it also includes other Hamiltonians whose interaction complexes cannot be coarse-grained into the case of Ref.   One motivation for this is the quantum PCP conjecture. Many commonly studied interaction complexes can be mapped to a 1-complex after removing a small fraction of sites. For commuting projector Hamiltonians on such complexes, a trivial ground state for the Hamiltonian with those sites removed is a low energy trivial state for the original Hamiltonian. Such states can act as a classical witness to the existence of a low energy state. While this result applies only to commuting Hamiltonians, it suggests that to prove a quantum PCP conjecture one should consider interaction complexes which cannot be mapped to 1-complexes after removing a small fraction of cells. We define this more precisely below; in a sense this generalizes the idea of an expander graph. Surprisingly, such complexes do exist as will be shown elsewhere, and have useful properties in quantum coding theory.",12,[],6

We show how this can be generalized to qudits, i.e. d-level systems, and provide a specific example for a V-type three-level atomic system whose transition dipole moments are not known.

Therefore, the entanglement concentration from the multiple state equation of a pure state equation to the multiple state equation of the EPR state equation seems to be able to be reversibly performed with an asymptotically infinitesimal error when the rate equation goes to equation. In this paper, we show that it is impossible to reversibly perform the entanglement concentration for a multiple pure state even in asymptotic situation. In addition, in the case when we recover the multiple state equation after the concentration for equation, we evaluate the asymptotic behavior of the loss number equation of equation. This evaluation is thought to be closely related to the entanglement compression in distant parties.",12,[],6

In spite of the fact that there is no entanglement between the two parts involved in this model, analytical derivation shows that the quantum discord is nonzero and highlights that quantum discord might be regarded as a figure of merit to characterize the quantum feature of QRACs, since this model has no classical counterparts. To gain further insight, we also investigate the dynamical behavior of quantum discord under state rotations. As a comparison, the connection between quantum discord and dimension witness is graphically discussed. Interestingly, our results illustrate that these two quantities are monotonically related to each other, which implies that the dimension witness and nonclassical correlations may be intrinsically linked.",12,[],6

The initial state of the photon field is assumed to be a superposition of coherent states, leading to a more intricate LZ transition. Applying the rotating-wave approximation (RWA), analytical results are obtained revealing the enhancement of the LZ probability by increasing the average photon number. We also consider the creation of entanglement and the change of photon statistics during the LZ process. Without the RWA, we find some qualitative differences of the LZ dynamics from the RWA results, e.g., the average photon number no longer monotonically enhances the LZ probability.

1207.0183,quant-ph,"We explore the question of state estimation for a qubit restricted to the equation-equation plane of the Bloch sphere, with the trine measurement. In our earlier work [H. K. Ng and B.-G. Englert, eprint arXiv:1202.5136[quant-ph] (2012)], similarities between quantum tomography and the tomography of a classical die motivated us to apply a simple modification of the classical estimator for use in the quantum problem. This worked very well. In this article, we adapt a different aspect of the classical estimator to the quantum problem. In particular, we investigate the mean estimator, where the mean is taken with a weight function identical to that in the classical estimator but now with quantum constraints imposed. Among such mean estimators, we choose an optimal one with the smallest worst-case error-the minimax mean estimator-and compare its performance with that of other estimators. Despite the natural generalization of the classical approach, this minimax mean estimator does not work as well as one might expect from the analogous performance in the classical problem. While it outperforms the often-used maximum-likelihood estimator in having a smaller worst-case error, the advantage is not significant enough to justify the more complicated procedure required to construct it. The much simpler adapted estimator introduced in our earlier work is still more effective. Our previous work emphasized the similarities between classical and quantum state estimation; in contrast, this paper highlights how intuition gained from classical problems can sometimes fail in the quantum arena.",12,[],6

In addition, we show that the Englert-Greenberger-Yasin duality relation can also be thought of as a consequence of the sum uncertainty relation for certain observables of the recoiling slit.

1202.6337,quant-ph,"In principle a quantum system could be used to simulate another quantum system. The purpose of such a simulation would be to obtain information about problems which cannot be simulated with a classical computer due to the exponential increase of the Hilbert space with the size of the system and which cannot be measured or controlled in an actual experiment. The system will interact with the surrounding environment, with the other particles in the system and be implemented using imperfect controls making it subject to noise. It has been suggested that noise does not need to be controlled to the same extent as it must be for general quantum computing. However the effects of noise in quantum simulations and how to treat them are not completely understood. In this paper we study an existing quantum algorithm for the one-dimensional Fano-Anderson model to be simulated using a liquid-state NMR device. We calculate the evolution of different initial states in the original model, and then we add interacting spins to simulate a more realistic situation. We find that states which are entangled with their environment, and sometimes correlated but not necessarily entangled have an evolution which is described by maps which are not completely positive.

In this paper, we will present an optimal ECP for such entangled electrons with the help of only one single photon. Compared with the protocol of Wang, the most significant advantage is that during the whole ECP, the single photon only needs to pass through one microcavity which will increase the total success probability if the cavity is imperfect. The whole protocol can be repeated to get a higher success probability. With the feasible technology, this protocol may be useful in current long-distance quantum communications.",12,[],6

Thanks to recent advances in single-shot readout capabilities for electronic spins in the solid state (such as Nitrogen Vacancy centers in diamond), this scheme can be as well applied to estimate the polarization of a spin bath coupled to the sensor spin.

We give two necessary conditions for the mediator system to generate the long-distance entanglement. We prove that the indirect interaction cannot generate the entanglement if it is `classical.' We also give a necessary condition for the effective fields on the probe spins to satisfy. Second, we generate the long-distance entanglement by the use of only external fields. We show that external fields on the adjacent spins to the probes are necessary in addition to external fields on the probe spins. Finally, we consider the cases where the coupling strength between each probe spin and the mediator system is finite.

The Lagrangian picture thus adds variables to the quantum formalism and exhibits a corresponding new quantum symmetry viz. a continuous particle-relabelling covariance group. Using Noether's theorem, the relabelling symmetry is derived as a component of a general investigation of symmetries and conservation laws in the quantum Lagrangian picture. Relations with symmetries and conservation laws in the Eulerian picture are explored in detail. Alongside the infinite relabelling group, the 12-parameter kinematical covariance group of the Schrodinger equation is derived.

We show that the presence of the gauge subsystem in the nine-qubit Bacon-Shor code allows for an optimized layout of the corresponding nanophotonic circuit that substantially ameliorates the effects of optical propagation losses, argue that code separability allows for simplified restoration feedback protocols, and propose a modified fidelity metric for quantifying the performance of realistic quantum memories.

We explore the non-Markovian dynamics by connecting the exact master equations with the non-equilibirum Green functions. Environmental back-actions are fully taken into account. The non-Markovian dynamics consists of non-exponential decays and dissipationless oscillations. Non-exponential decays are induced by the discontinuity in the imaginary part of the self-energy corrections. Dissipationless oscillations arise from band gaps or the finite band structure of spectral densities.

We derive an exact stochastic Schrodinger equation (SSE), called fermionic quantum state diffusion (QSD) equation, from the first principle by using the fermionic coherent state representation. The reduced density operator for the open system can be recovered from the average of the solutions to the QSD equation over the Grassmann-type noise. By employing the exact fermionic QSD equation, we can derive the corresponding exact master equation. The power of our approach is illustrated by the applications of our stochastic approach to several models of interest including the one-qubit dissipative model, the coupled two-qubit dissipative model, the quantum Brownian motion model and the N-fermion model coupled to a fermionic bath.
