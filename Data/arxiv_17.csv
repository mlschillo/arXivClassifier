1703.03823,astro-ph,"We confirm the reality of the recently discovered Milky Way stellar cluster equation 1 using spectra acquired with the HERMES and AAOmega spectrographs of the Anglo-Australian Telescope. This cluster had been previously undiscovered due to its close angular proximity to Sirius, the brightest star in the sky at visual wavelengths. Our observations identified 41 cluster members, and yielded an overall metallicity of [Fe/H]equation and barycentric radial velocity of equation km/s. These kinematics provide a dynamical mass estimate of equation Mequation. Isochrone fits to equation, 2MASS, and Pan-STARRS1 photometry indicate that equation 1 is an intermediate age (equation Gyr) stellar cluster. Combining the spatial and kinematic data we calculate equation 1 has a circular orbit with a radius of about 12~kpc, but with a large out of plane motion: equation kpc. Clusters with such orbits are unlikely to survive long due to the number of plane passages they would experience.",17,[],1
1705.07828,astro-ph,"We present polarisation spectra of seven stars in the lines-of-sight towards the Sco OB1 association. Our spectra were obtained within the framework of the Large Interstellar Polarization Survey carried out with the FORS instrument of the ESO VLT. We have modelled the wavelength-dependence of extinction and linear polarisation with a dust model for the diffuse interstellar medium which consists of a mixture of particles with size ranging from the molecular domain of 0.5 nm up to 350 nm. We have included stochastically heated small dust grains with radii between 0.5 and 6 nm made of graphite and silicate, as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules (PAHs), and we have assumed that larger particles are prolate spheroids made of amorphous carbon and silicate. Overall, a dust model with eight free parameters best reproduces the observations. Reducing the number of free parameters leads to results that are inconsistent with cosmic abundance constraints. We found that aligned silicates are the dominant contributor to the observed polarisation, and that the polarisation spectra are best-fit by a lower limit of the equivolume sphere radius of aligned grains of 70 - 200nm.",17,[],1
1711.07932,astro-ph,"We study the dynamical evolution of the TRAPPIST-1 system under the influence of orbital circularization through tidal interaction with the central star. We find that systems with parameters close to the observed one evolve into a state where consecutive planets are linked by first order resonances and consecutive triples, apart from planets c, d and e, by connected three body Laplace resonances. The system expands with period ratios increasing and mean eccentricities decreasing with time. This evolution is largely driven by tides acting on the innermost planets which then influence the outer ones. In order that deviations from commensurability become significant only on equation time scales or longer, we require that the tidal parameter associated with the planets has to be such that equation At the same time, if we start with two subsystems, with the inner three planets comprising the inner one, equation associated with the planets has to be on the order (and not significantly exceeding) equation for the two subsystems to interact and end up in the observed configuration. This scenario is also supported by modelling of the evolution through disk migration which indicates that the whole system cannot have migrated inwards together. Also in order to avoid large departures from commensurabilities, the system cannot have stalled at a disk inner edge for significant time periods. We discuss the habitability consequences of the tidal dissipation implied by our modelling, concluding that planets d, e and f are potentially in habitable zones.",17,[],1
1705.07132,astro-ph,"Future large-scale surveys with high resolution imaging will provide us with a few equation new strong galaxy-scale lenses. These strong lensing systems however will be contained in large data amounts which are beyond the capacity of human experts to visually classify in a unbiased way. We present a new strong gravitational lens finder based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The method was applied to the Strong Lensing challenge organised by the Bologna Lens Factory. It achieved first and third place respectively on the space-based data-set and the ground-based data-set. The goal was to find a fully automated lens finder for ground-based and space-based surveys which minimizes human inspect. We compare the results of our CNN architecture and three new variations (""invariant"" ""views"" and ""residual"") on the simulated data of the challenge. Each method has been trained separately 5 times on 17 000 simulated images, cross-validated using 3 000 images and then applied to a 100 000 image test set. We used two different metrics for evaluation, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) score and the recall with no false positive (equation). For ground based data our best method achieved an AUC score of equation and a equation of equation. For space-based data our best method achieved an AUC score of equation and a equation of equation. On space-based data adding dihedral invariance to the CNN architecture diminished the overall score but achieved a higher no contamination recall. We found that using committees of 5 CNNs produce the best recall at zero contamination and consistenly score better AUC than a single CNN. We found that for every variation of our CNN lensfinder, we achieve AUC scores close to equation within equation.",17,[],1
1710.08151,astro-ph,"V2492 Cyg is a young pre-main sequence star presenting repetitive brightness variations of significant amplitude (Delta R > 5 mag) whose physical origin has been ascribed to both extinction (UXor-type) and accretion (EXor-type) variability, although their mutual proportion has not been clarified yet. Recently, V2492 Cyg has reached a level of brightness ever registered in the period of its documented activity. Optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy have been obtained in October 2016 and between March and July 2017. The source has remained bright until the end of May 2017, then it started to rapidly fade since the beginning of June at a rate of about 0.08 mag/day. On mid-July 2017 the source has reached the same low-brightness level as two years before. Extinction and mass accretion rate were derived by means of the luminosity of the brightest lines, in particular Halpha and Hbeta. A couple of optical high-resolution spectra are also presented to derive information on the gas kinematics. Visual extinction variations do not exceed a few magnitudes, while the mass accretion rate is estimated to vary from less than 10-8 up to a few 10-7 Msun/yr. This latter is comparable to that estimated on the previous high-state in 2010, likely occurred under more severe extinction conditions. The combined analysis of the optical and near-infrared (NIR) observations extends to the present event the original suggestion that the V2492 Cyg variability is a combination of changing extinction and accretion.",17,[],1
1707.02936,astro-ph,"Polarized emission from aligned dust is a crucial tool for studies of magnetism in the ISM and a troublesome contaminant for studies of CMB polarization. In each case, an understanding of the significance of the polarization signal requires well-calibrated physical models of dust grains. Despite decades of progress in theory and observation, polarized dust models remain largely underconstrained. During its 2012 flight, the balloon-borne telescope BLASTPol obtained simultaneous broad-band polarimetric maps of a translucent molecular cloud at 250, 350, and 500 microns. Combining these data with polarimetry from the Planck 850 micron band, we have produced a submillimeter polarization spectrum for a cloud of this type for the first time. We find the polarization degree to be largely constant across the four bands. This result introduces a new observable with the potential to place strong empirical constraints on ISM dust polarization models in a previously inaccessible density regime. Comparing with models by Draine and Fraisse (2009), our result disfavors two of their models for which all polarization arises due only to aligned silicate grains. By creating simple models for polarized emission in a translucent cloud, we verify that extinction within the cloud should have only a small effect on the polarization spectrum shape compared to the diffuse ISM. Thus we expect the measured polarization spectrum to be a valid check on diffuse ISM dust models. The general flatness of the observed polarization spectrum suggests a challenge to models where temperature and alignment degree are strongly correlated across major dust components.",17,[],1
1708.04355,astro-ph,"Only five binary systems have been found to emit at TeV energies. Each of these systems is composed of a massive O or B type star and a compact object (black hole or a pulsar). The type of compact object and the origin of the gamma-ray emission is unknown for most of these systems. Extending spectral observations to higher energies can help disentangle the nature of the compact object as well as the particle acceleration mechanisms present. Interestingly, the TeV emission from these systems does not always coincide with their emission in GeV or X-ray, which is how many such systems have been originally discovered. Increased coverage of these systems may allow HAWC to see precisely when in the orbit the TeV emission begins and ends. The HAWC Observatory detects TeV gamma-rays with high sensitivity, covering over two-thirds of the overhead sky every day. Applying a stacking method to known TeV binary systems can help HAWC enhance the signal from TeV binaries above the steady background from other sources in the galaxy. We will present results from this stacking analysis using 760 days of HAWC data.",17,['hep-ex'],1
1709.05756,astro-ph,"Gravitational redshift as a relativistic effect in cosmological objects is investigated. Possible signatures of the gravitational redshift in measurements of satellite galaxies in clusters of galaxies, intracluster gas, as well as galaxies associated with voids are investigated by developing simple theoretical models. In the analysis of the gravitational redshift of satellite galaxies, we develop a very simple analytic model for satellite galaxies virialised in halos, which enables us to evaluate the signals depending on the properties of the halo occupation distribution of galaxies. We obtain results consistent with recent previous results, though our results are restricted to the satellite galaxies inside the virial radius. In the analysis of intracluster gas, we develop a simple analytic model including the effect of random motions of gases, which are assumed to generate nonthermal pressure. We demonstrate a possible contribution of the random motions of gases to the gravitational redshift. We also investigate a possible signature of the gravitational redshift in measurements of galaxies associated with voids, for the first time as far as we know, by utilising a simple analytic model. We show that the second-order Hubble term, which appears in the expansion of the scale factor around the centre of a void, may make a significant contribution depending on the way the galaxy samples are analysed.",17,['gr-qc'],1
1710.05656,astro-ph,"Distributed radio interferometric calibration based on consensus optimization has been shown to improve the estimation of systematic errors in radio astronomical observations. The intrinsic continuity of systematic errors across frequency is used by a consensus polynomial to penalize traditional calibration. Consensus is achieved via the use of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. In this paper, we extend the existing distributed calibration algorithms to use ADMM with an adaptive penalty parameter update. Compared to a fixed penalty, its adaptive update has been shown to perform better in diverse applications of ADMM. In this paper, we compare two such popular penalty parameter update schemes: residual balance penalty update and spectral penalty update (Barzilai-Borwein). We apply both schemes to distributed radio interferometric calibration and compare their performance against ADMM with a fixed penalty parameter. Simulations show that both methods of adaptive penalty update improve the convergence of ADMM but the spectral penalty parameter update shows more stability.",17,['cs'],1
1712.02920,astro-ph,"Over a thousand stars in our Galaxy have been detected as radio emitters, but no normal stars are known to possess radio-emitting lobes similar to radio galaxies. Several recent attempts by us and other authors to find such objects remained inconclusive. Here we present a further search for double-lobed radio stars in two large samples of spectroscopic stars: over 20,000 white dwarves from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR12, and 2.5 million stars from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). These were cross-matched with sources from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) survey at 1.4 GHz to look for source pairs straddling the stars with moderate symmetry about the stars. We found only four promising candidates for double-lobed radio stars, confirming they must be extremely rare. By comparison with SDSS, we inferred that about 16 per cent of LAMOST spectra may have erroneous classifications. We also rediscovered the giant radio galaxy J09273510 and propose a different, more distant host, suggesting a much larger radio size of 2.7 Mpc.",17,[],1
1712.04483,astro-ph,"We present a single candidate transit event around Proxima Centauri, found during a blind transit search using a robotic 30\,cm telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. The event lasted 1 hour, with an estimated depth of 5\,mmag, and is inconsistent with the transit window predicted for the recently discovered planet b. We modeled the lightcurve under the assumption that the event was caused by a transiting exoplanet, and our model predicts the planet has a radius equation. We encourage continued monitoring of Proxima to elucidate the origin of this event.",17,[],1
1702.00664,astro-ph,"We present a catalog of sources detected above 10 GeV by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) in the first 7 years of data using the Pass 8 event-level analysis. This is the Third Catalog of Hard Fermi-LAT Sources (3FHL), containing 1556 objects characterized in the 10 GeV - 2 TeV energy range. The sensitivity and angular resolution are improved by factors of 3 and 2 relative to the previous LAT catalog at the same energies (1FHL). The vast majority of detected sources (79%) are associated with extragalactic counterparts at other wavelengths, including 16 sources located at very high redshift (equation). Eight percent of the sources have Galactic counterparts and 13% are unassociated (or associated with a source of unknown nature). The high-latitude sky and the Galactic plane are observed with a flux sensitivity of 4.4 to 9.5equation ph cmequation sequation, respectively (this is approximately 0.5% and 1% of the Crab Nebula flux above 10 GeV). The catalog includes 214 new equation-ray sources. The substantial increase in the number of photons (more than 4 times relative to 1FHL and 10 times to 2FHL) also allows us to measure significant spectral curvature for 32 sources and find flux variability for 163 of them. Furthermore, we estimate that for the same flux limit of equation erg cmequation sequation, the energy range above 10 GeV has twice as many sources as above 50 GeV, highlighting the importance, for future Cherenkov telescopes, of lowering the energy threshold as much as possible.",17,[],1
1711.02176,astro-ph,"Radial magnetic fields are observed in all known young, shell-type supernova remnants (SNRs) in our Galaxy, including Cas A, Tycho, Kepler, and SN1006 and yet the nature of these radial fields has not been thoroughly explored. Using a 3D model, we consider the existence and observational implications of an intrinsically radial field. We also present a new explanation of the origin of the radial pattern observed from polarization data as resulting from a selection effect due to the distribution of cosmic-ray electrons (CREs). We show that quasi-parallel acceleration can concentrate CREs at regions where the magnetic field is radial, making a completely turbulent field appear ordered, when it is in fact disordered. We discuss observational properties that may help distinguish between an intrinsically radial magnetic field and the case where it only appears radial due to the CRE distribution. We also show that the case of an intrinsically radial field with a quasi-perpendicular CRE acceleration mechanism has intriguing similarities to the observed polarization properties of SN1006.",17,[],1
1705.01588,astro-ph,"We report the large effort which is producing comprehensive high-level young star cluster (YSC) catalogues for a significant fraction of galaxies observed with the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS) Hubble treasury program. We present the methodology developed to extract cluster positions, verify their genuine nature, produce multiband photometry (from NUV to NIR), and derive their physical properties via spectral energy distribution fitting analyses. We use the nearby spiral galaxy NGC628 as a test case for demonstrating the impact that LEGUS will have on our understanding of the formation and evolution of YSCs and compact stellar associations within their host galaxy. Our analysis of the cluster luminosity function from the UV to the NIR finds a steepening at the bright end and at all wavelengths suggesting a dearth of luminous clusters. The cluster mass function of NGC628 is consistent with a power-law distribution of slopes equation and a truncation of a few times equation Mequation. After their formation YSCs and compact associations follow different evolutionary paths. YSCs survive for a longer timeframe, confirming their being potentially bound systems. Associations disappear on time scales comparable to hierarchically organized star-forming regions, suggesting that they are expanding systems. We find mass-independent cluster disruption in the inner region of NGC628, while in the outer part of the galaxy there is little or no disruption. We observe faster disruption rates for low mass (equation equation Mequation) clusters suggesting that a mass-dependent component is necessary to fully describe the YSC disruption process in NGC628.",17,[],1
1706.01567,astro-ph,"Suzaku measurements of a homogeneous metal distribution of equation Solar in the outskirts of the nearby Perseus cluster suggest that chemical elements were deposited and mixed into the intergalactic medium before clusters formed, likely over 10 billion years ago. A key prediction of this early enrichment scenario is that the intracluster medium in all massive clusters should be uniformly enriched to a similar level. Here, we confirm this prediction by determining the iron abundances in the outskirts (equation) of a sample of ten other nearby galaxy clusters observed with Suzaku for which robust measurements based on the Fe-K lines can be made. Across our sample the iron abundances are consistent with a constant value, equation Solar (equation for 25 degrees of freedom). This is remarkably similar to the measurements for the Perseus cluster of equation Solar, using the Solar abundance scale of Asplund et al. (2009).",17,[],1
1711.04616,astro-ph,"We report the equation confirmation of two large-scale filaments along the sight-line of the blazar 1ES~1553113, which correspond to Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM) absorption features in the X-ray and far ultraviolet. We use the WISE-SuperCOSMOS photometric catalog to map the cosmic-web in the direction of the blazar, and find significant filaments at redshifts of equation and equation, which roughly align with the absorption redshifts. A third X-ray absorption feature at equation did not have any corresponding structures in the photometric catalog.",17,[],1
1707.02528,astro-ph,"Dissipative dark matter, where dark matter particle properties closely resemble familiar baryonic matter, is considered. Mirror dark matter, which arises from an isomorphic hidden sector, is a specific and theoretically constrained scenario. Other possibilities include models with more generic hidden sectors that contain massless dark photons (unbroken equation gauge interactions). Such dark matter not only features dissipative cooling processes, but is also assumed to have nontrivial heating sourced by ordinary supernovae (facilitated by the kinetic mixing interaction). The dynamics of dissipative dark matter halos around rotationally supported galaxies, influenced by heating as well as cooling processes, can be modelled by fluid equations. For a sufficiently isolated galaxy with stable star formation rate, the dissipative dark matter halos are expected to evolve to a steady state configuration which is in hydrostatic equilibrium and where heating and cooling rates locally balance. Here, we take into account the major cooling and heating processes, and numerically solve for the steady state solution under the assumptions of spherical symmetry, negligible dark magnetic fields, and that supernova sourced energy is transported to the halo via dark radiation. For the parameters considered, and assumptions made, we were unable to find a physically realistic solution for the constrained case of mirror dark matter halos. Halo cooling generally exceeds heating at realistic halo mass densities. This problem can be rectified in more generic dissipative dark matter models, and we discuss a specific example in some detail.",17,['hep-ph'],1
1702.03421,astro-ph,"Our aim is to derive a self-consistent age, distance and composition for the globular cluster equationTucanae (equationTuc; NGC104). First, we reevaluate the reddening towards the cluster resulting in a nominal equation as the best estimate. The equation of the components of the eclipsing binary member V69 is found to be equation K from both photometric and spectroscopic evidence. This yields a true distance modulus equation(random)equation(systematic) to equationTuc when combined with existing measurements of V69 radii and luminosity ratio. We then present a new completely self-consistent isochrone fitting method to ground based and equation cluster colour-magnitude diagrams and the eclipsing binary member V69. The analysis suggests that the composition of V69, and by extension one of the populations of equationTuc, is given by [Fe/H]equation, [O/Fe]equation, and equation on the solar abundance scale of Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval. However, this depends on the accuracy of the model equation scale which is 50-75 K cooler than our best estimate but within measurement uncertainties. Our best estimate of the age of equationTuc is 11.8 Gyr, with firm (equation) lower and upper limits of 10.4 and 13.4 Gyr, respectively, in satisfactory agreement with the age derived from the white dwarf cooling sequence if our determination of the distance modulus is adopted.",17,[],1
1704.03464,astro-ph,"Protected by an approximate shift symmetry, axions are well motivated candidates for driving cosmic inflation. Their generic coupling to the Chern-Simons term of any gauge theory gives rise to a wide range of potentially observable signatures, including equilateral non-Gaussianites in the CMB, chiral gravitational waves in the range of direct gravitational wave detectors and primordial black holes (PBHs). In this paper we revisit these predictions for axion inflation models non-minimally coupled to gravity. Contrary to the case of minimally coupled models which typically predict scale-invariant mass distributions for the generated PBHs at small scales, we demonstrate how broadly peaked PBH spectra naturally arises in this setup. For specific parameter values, all of dark matter can be accounted for by PBHs.",17,"['hep-ph', 'hep-th']",1
1701.09027,astro-ph,"The NASA Dawn spacecraft acquired thousands of images of asteroid Vesta during its year-long orbital tour, and is now on its way to asteroid Ceres. A method for calibrating images acquired by the onboard Framing Camera was described by Schroder et al. (2013; Icarus 226, 1304). However, their method is only valid for point sources. In this paper we extend the calibration to images of extended sources like Vesta. For this, we devise a first-order correction for in-field stray light, which is known to plague images taken through the narrow band filters, and revise the flat fields that were acquired in an integrating sphere before launch. We used calibrated images of the Vesta surface to construct simple photometric models for all filters, that allow us to study how the spectrum changes with increasing phase angle (phase reddening). In combination with these models, our calibration method can be used to create near-seamless mosaics that are radiometrically accurate to a few percent. Such mosaics are provided in JVesta, the Vesta version of the JMARS geographic information system.",17,[],1
1710.01053,astro-ph,"Massive large-scale AGN outflows are an important element of galaxy evolution, being a way through which the AGN can affect most of the host galaxy. However, outflows evolve on timescales much longer than typical AGN episode durations, therefore most AGN outflows are not observed simultaneously with the AGN episode that inflated them. It is therefore remarkable that rather tight correlations between outflow prop- erties and AGN luminosity exist. In this paper, I show that such correlations can be preserved during the fading phase of the AGN episode, provided that the AGN lumi- nosity evolves as a power law with exponent equation at late times. I also show that subsequent AGN episodes that illuminate an ongoing outflow are unlikely to produce outflow momentum or energy rates rising above the observed correlations. However, there may be many difficult-to-detect outflows with momentum and energy rates lower than expected from the current AGN luminosity. Detailed observations of AGN out- flow properties might help constrain the activity histories of typical and/or individual AGN.",17,[],1
1702.07355,astro-ph,"We investigate the star formation history and chemical evolution of isolated analogues of Local Group (LG) ultra faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs; stellar mass range of 102 solar mass < Mstar <105 solar mass) and gas rich, low mass dwarfs (Leo P analogs; stellar mass range of 105 solar mass < Mstar <106 solar mass). We perform a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations to follow their evolution from the era of the first generation of stars down to z=0. We confirm that reionization, combined with supernova (SN) feedback, is primarily responsible for the truncated star formation in UFDs. Specifically, haloes with a virial mass of Mvir < 2 x 109 solar mass form> 90\% of stars prior to reionization. Our work further demonstrates the importance of Population~III (Pop~III) stars, with their intrinsically high equation yields, and the associated external metal-enrichment, in producing low-metallicity stars (equation) and carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars. We find that UFDs are composite systems, assembled from multiple progenitor haloes, some of which hosted only Population~II (Pop~II) stars formed in environments externally enriched by SNe in neighboring haloes, naturally producing, extremely low-metallicity Pop~II stars. We illustrate how the simulated chemical enrichment may be used to constrain the star formation histories (SFHs) of true observed UFDs. We find that Leo P analogs can form in haloes with Mvir ~ 4 x 109 solar mass (z=0). Such systems are less affected by reionization and continue to form stars until z=0, causing higher metallicity tails. Finally, we predict the existence of extremely low-metallicity stars in LG UFD galaxies that preserve the pure chemical signatures of Pop~III nucleosynthesis.",17,[],1
1711.00325,astro-ph,"The Fermi Gamma-ray Observatory discovered about a thousand extragalactic sources emitting energy from 100 MeV to 100 GeV. The majority of these sources belong to the class of blazars characterized by a quasi-featureless optical spectrum (BL Lac Objects). This hampers the determination of their redshift and therefore hinders the characterization of this class of objects. To investigate the nature of these sources and to determine their redshift, we are carrying out an extensive campaign using the 10m Gran Telescopio Canarias to obtain high S/N ratio optical spectra. These observations allow us to confirm the blazar nature of the targets, to find new redshifts or to set stringent limits on the redshift based on the minimum equivalent width of specific absorption features that can be measured in the spectrum and are expected from their host galaxy, assuming it is a massive elliptical galaxy. These results are of importance for the multi-frequencies emission models of the blazars, to test their extreme physics, to shed light on their cosmic evolution and abundance in the far Universe. These gamma emitters are also of great importance for the characterization of the extragalactic background light through the absorption by the IR-optical background photons.",17,[],1
1707.01101,astro-ph,"Observations of molecular hydrogen (Hequation) fluorescence are a potentially useful tool for measuring the Hequation abundance in exoplanet atmospheres. This emission was previously observed in Mequationdwarfs with planetary systems. However, low signal-to-noise prevented a conclusive determination of its origin. Possible sources include exoplanetary atmospheres, circumstellar gas disks, and the stellar surface. We use observations from the ""Measurements of the Ultraviolet Spectral Characteristics of Low-mass Exoplanet Host Stars"" (MUSCLES) Treasury Survey to study Hequation fluorescence in Mequationdwarfs. We detect fluorescence in Hubble Space Telescope spectra of 8/9 planet-hosting and 5/6 non-planet-hosting Mequationdwarfs. The detection statistics, velocity centroids, and line widths of the emission suggest a stellar origin. We calculate Hequation-to-stellar-ion flux ratios to compare flux levels between stars. For stars with planets, we find an average ratio of 1.7equation0.9 using the fluxes of the brightest Hequation feature and two stellar C IV lines. This is compared to 0.9equation0.4 for stars without planets, showing that the planet-hosting Mequationdwarfs do not have significant excess Hequation emission. This claim is supported by the direct FUV imaging of GJ 832, where no fluorescence is observed at the expected star-planet separation. Additionally, the 3-equation upper limit of 4.9equation10equation ergequationcmequationsequation from these observations is two orders of magnitude below the spectroscopically-observed Hequation flux. We constrain the location of the fluorescing Hequation using 1D radiative transfer models and find that it could reside in starspots or a equation2500-3000equationK region in the lower chromosphere. The presence of this emission could complicate efforts to quantify the atmospheric abundance of Hequation in exoplanets orbiting Mequationdwarfs.",17,[],1
1707.09354,astro-ph,"Cosmology in the near future promises a measurement of the sum of neutrino masses, a fundamental Standard Model parameter, as well as substantially-improved constraints on the dark energy. We use the shape of the BOSS redshift-space galaxy power spectrum, in combination with CMB and supernova data, to constrain the neutrino masses and the dark energy. Essential to this calculation are several recent advances in non-linear cosmological perturbation theory, including FFT methods, redshift space distortions, and scale-dependent growth. Our 95% confidence upper bound of 180 meV on the sum of masses degrades substantially to 540 meV when the dark energy equation of state and its first derivative are also allowed to vary, representing a significant challenge to current constraints. We also study the impact of additional galaxy bias parameters, finding that a greater allowed range of scale-dependent bias only slightly shifts the preferred neutrino mass value, weakens its upper bound by about 20%, and has a negligible effect on the other cosmological parameters.",17,['hep-ph'],1
1711.03555,astro-ph,"Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) are processes where stars are torn apart by the strong gravitational force near to a massive or supermassive black hole. If a jet is launched in such a process, particle acceleration may take place in internal shocks. We demonstrate that jetted TDEs can simultaneously describe the observed neutrino and cosmic ray fluxes at the highest energies if stars with heavier compositions, such as carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, are tidally disrupted and these events are sufficiently abundant. We simulate the photo-hadronic interactions both in the TDE jet and in the propagation through the extragalactic space and we show that the simultaneous description of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) and PeV neutrino data implies that a nuclear cascade in the jet develops by photo-hadronic interactions.",17,[],1
1707.01542,astro-ph,"Many radio galaxies show the presence of dense and dusty gas near the active nucleus. This can be traced by both 21cm HI absorption and soft X-ray absorption, offering new insight into the physical nature of the circumnuclear medium of these distant galaxies. To better understand this relationship, we investigate soft X-ray absorption as an indicator for the detection of associated HI absorption, as part of preparation for the First Large Absorption Survey in HI (FLASH) to be undertaken with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We present the results of our pilot study using the Boolardy Engineering Test Array, a precursor to ASKAP, to search for new absorption detections in radio sources brighter than 1 Jy that also feature soft X-ray absorption. Based on this pilot survey, we detected HI absorption towards the radio source PKS 1657-298 at a redshift of z = 0.42. This source also features the highest X-ray absorption ratio of our pilot sample by a factor of 3, which is consistent with our general findings that X-ray absorption predicates the presence of dense neutral gas. By comparing the X-ray properties of AGN with and without detection of HI absorption at radio wavelengths, we find that X-ray hardness ratio and HI absorption optical depth are correlated at a statistical significance of 4.71letter. We conclude by considering the impact of these findings on future radio and X-ray absorption studies.",17,[],1
1711.02934,astro-ph,"The presence and properties of compact radio sources embedded in massive star-forming regions can reveal important physical properties about these regions and the processes occurring within them. The NGC 6334 complex, a massive star-forming region, has been studied extensively. Nevertheless, none of these studies has focused in its content in compact radio sources. We report on a systematic census of the compact radio sources toward NGC 6334, and their characteristics. This will be used to try and define their very nature. We use VLA C band (4-8 GHz) archive data with 0.36"" of spatial resolution and noise level of 50 uJy/bm to carry out a systematic search for compact radio sources within NGC 6334. We also search for infrared counterparts to provide some constraints on the nature of the detected radio sources. A total of 83 compact sources and three slightly resolved sources were detected. Most of them are here reported for the first time. We found that 29 of these 86 sources have infrared counterparts and three are highly variable. Region D contains 18 of these sources. The compact source toward the center, in projection, of region E is also detected. From statistical analyses, we suggest that the 83 reported compact sources are real and most of them are related to NGC 6334 itself. A stellar nature for 27 of them is confirmed by their IR emission. Compared with Orion, region D suffers a deficit of compact radio sources. The infrared nebulosities around two of the slightly resolved sources are suggested to be warm dust, and we argue that the associated radio sources trace free-free emission from ionized material. We confirm the thermal radio emission of the compact source in region E. However, its detection at infrared wavelengths implies that it is located in the foreground of the molecular cloud. Three strongly variable sources are suggested to be magnetically active young stars.",17,[],1
1711.01482,astro-ph,"Over almost three decades the TAUP conference has seen a remarkable momentum gain in direct dark matter search. An important accelerator were first indications for a modulating signal rate in the DAMA/NaI experiment reported in 1997. Today the presence of an annual modulation, which matches in period and phase the expectation for dark matter, is supported at > 9equation confidence. The underlying nature of dark matter, however, is still considered an open and fundamental question of particle physics. No other direct dark matter search could confirm the DAMA claim up to now; moreover, numerous null-results are in clear contradiction under so-called standard assumptions for the dark matter halo and the interaction mechanism of dark with ordinary matter. As both bear a dependence on the target material, resolving this controversial situation will convincingly only be possible with an experiment using sodium iodide (NaI) as target. COSINUS aims to even go a step further by combining NaI with a novel detection approach. COSINUS aims to operate NaI as a cryogenic calorimeter reading scintillation light and phonon/heat signal. Two distinct advantages arise from this approach, a substantially lower energy threshold for nuclear recoils and particle identification on an event-by-event basis. These key benefits will allow COSINUS to clarify a possible nuclear recoil origin of the DAMA signal with comparatively little exposure of O(100kg days) and, thereby, answer a long-standing question of particle physics. Today COSINUS is in R&D phase; in this contribution we show results from the 2nd prototype, albeit the first one of the final foreseen detector design. The key finding of this measurement is that pure, undoped NaI is a truly excellent scintillator at low temperatures: We measure 13.1% of the total deposited energy in the NaI crystal in the form of scintillation light (in the light detector).",17,['physics'],1
1712.04448,astro-ph,"The radial acceleration measured in bright galaxies tightly correlates with that generated by the observed distribution of baryons, a phenomenon known as the radial acceleration relation (RAR). Dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies have been recently found to depart from the extrapolation of the RAR measured for more massive objects but with a substantially larger scatter. If confirmed by new data, this result provides a powerful test of the theory of gravity at low accelerations that requires robust theoretical predictions. By using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, we show that, within the standard model of cosmology (equationCDM), satellite galaxies are expected to follow the same RAR as brighter systems but with a much larger scatter which does not correlate with the physical properties of the galaxies. In the simulations, the RAR evolves mildly with redshift. Moreover, the acceleration due to the gravitational field of the host has no effect on the RAR. This is in contrast with the External Field Effect in Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) which causes galaxies in strong external fields to deviate from the RAR. This difference between equationCDM and MOND offers a possible way to discriminate between them.",17,[],1

Even though the achieved background level does not approach that of DAMA/LIBRA, it is crucial to have a quantitative understanding of the backgrounds. We have studied background simulations toward a deeper understanding of the backgrounds and developed background models for a 9.16-kg NaI(Tl) crystal used in the test arrangement. In this paper we describe the contributions of background sources quantitatively by performing Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations that are fitted to the measured data to quantify the unknown fractions of the background compositions. In the fitted results, the overall simulated background spectrum well describes the measured data with a 9.16-kg NaI(Tl) crystal and shows that the background sources are dominated by surface equationPb and internal equationK in the 2 to 6-keV energy interval, which produce 2.4 counts/day/keV/kg (dru) and 0.5 dru, respectively.",17,['physics'],1
1701.04580,astro-ph,"The evolution of main sequence binaries resided in the galactic centre is influenced a lot by the central super massive black hole (SMBH). Due to this perturbation, the stars in a dense environment are likely to experience mergers or collisions through secular or non-secular interactions. In this work, we study the dynamics of the stellar binaries at galactic center, perturbed by another distant SMBH. Geometrically, such a four-body system is supposed to be decomposed into the inner triple (SMBH-star-star) and the outer triple (SMBH-stellar binary-SMBH). We survey the parameter space and determine the criteria analytically for the stellar mergers and the tidal disruption events (TDEs). For a relative distant and equal masses SMBH binary, the stars have more opportunities to merge as a result from the Lidov-Kozai(LK) oscillations in the inner triple. With a sample of tight stellar binaries, our numerical experiments reveal that a significant fraction of the binaries, ~70 per cent, experience merger eventually. Whereas the majority of the stellar TDEs are likely to occur at a close periapses to the SMBH, induced by the outer Kozai effect. The tidal disruptions are found numerically as many as ~10 per cent for a close SMBH binary that is enhanced significantly than the one without the external SMBH. These effects require the outer perturber to have an inclined orbit (>=40 degree) relatively to the inner orbital plane and may lead to a burst of the extremely astronomical events associated with the detection of the SMBH binary.",17,[],1
1708.03238,astro-ph,"We conducted a detailed radiative transfer modeling of the dust emission from the circumstellar disk around HL Tau. The goal of our study is to derive the surface density profile of the inner disk and its structure. In addition to the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array images at Band 3 (2.9mm), Band 6 (1.3mm), and Band 7 (0.87mm), the most recent Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations at 7mm were included in the analysis. A simulated annealing algorithm was invoked to search for the optimum model. The radiative transfer analysis demonstrates that most radial components (i.e., >6AU) of the disk become optically thin at a wavelength of 7mm, which allows us to constrain, for the first time, the dust density distribution in the inner region of the disk. We found that a homogeneous grain size distribution is not sufficient to explain the observed images at different wavelengths simultaneously, while models with a shallower grain size distribution in the inner disk work well. We found clear evidence that larger grains are trapped in the first bright ring. Our results imply that dust evolution has already taken place in the disk at a relatively young (i.e., ~1Myr) age. We compared the midplane temperature distribution, optical depth, and properties of various dust rings with those reported previously. Using the Toomre parameter, we briefly discussed the gravitational instability as a potential mechanism for the origin of the dust clump detected in the first bright ring via the VLA observations.",17,[],1
1705.02024,astro-ph,"Recent work on improving and revising estimates of solar activity [Clette et al., 2014] has resulted in renewed interest in what has been called the longest running 'Science Experiment'. We compare four reconstructions of solar activity as reflected in the number of sunspot groups ('active regions') constructed by different authors using very different methods. We concentrate on the period since AD 1900 where the underlying solar and geomagnetic data are plentiful and of sufficient quality and find that all four methods yield essentially the same Sunspot Group Number series. We take that as indicating that protracted and pernicious criticisms of the individual methods are neither fruitful nor helpful and we suggest that future efforts be directed towards understanding the specific reasons why the methods give discordant results for centuries prior to the 20th. The main area of disagreement occurs during the last 25 years of the 19th century and feeds back into the time prior to that. The solar Extreme Ultraviolet flux can be reconstructed since the 1740s [Svalgaard, 2016] and with suitable scaling fits the Svalgaard & Schatten [2016] Sunspot Group Number series since 1865 very well, so we argue that the discordant group series have problems once we move out of the 20th century, and that the community should concentrate on finding out what those are, so a true and useful consensus can emerge.",17,[],1
1708.04363,astro-ph,"We use a new contiguous imaging survey conducted using the Dark Energy Camera to investigate the distribution and properties of young stellar populations in the Magellanic inter-Cloud region. These young stars are strongly spatially clustered, forming a narrow chain of low-mass associations that trace the densest HI gas in the Magellanic Bridge and extend, in projection, from the SMC to the outer disk of the LMC. The associations in our survey footprint have ages equation Myr, masses in the range equation, and very diffuse structures with half-light radii of up to equation pc. The two most populous are strongly elliptical, and aligned to equation with the axis joining the centres of the LMC and SMC. These observations strongly suggest that the young inter-Cloud populations formed in situ, likely due to the compression of gas stripped during the most recent close LMC-SMC encounter. The associations lie at distances intermediate between the two Clouds, and we find no evidence for a substantial distance gradient across the imaged area. Finally, we identify a vast shell of young stars surrounding a central association, that is spatially coincident with a low column density bubble in the HI distribution. The properties of this structure are consistent with a scenario where stellar winds and supernova explosions from massive stars in the central cluster swept up the ambient gas into a shell, triggering a new burst of star formation. This is a prime location for studying stellar feedback in a relatively isolated environment.",17,[],1
1710.04619,astro-ph,"Pulsars and neutron stars are generally more massive than the Sun, whereas black holes have unlimited mass-spectrum, though the mass-gap between 2 - 5equation, which applies for both classes, is evident and remains puzzling. Based on the solution of the TOV equation modified to include a universal scalar field equation at the background of supranuclear densities, we claim that pulsars must be born with embryonic super-baryons (SBs), that form through the merger of individual neutrons at their centers. The cores of SBs are made of purely incompressible superconducting gluon-quark superfluids (henceforth SuSu-fluids). Such quantum fluids have a uniform supranuclear density and governed by the critical EOSs for baryonic matter equation and for equationinduced dark energy equation The incompressibility here ensures that particles communicate on the shortest possible timescale, superfluidity and superconductivity enforce SBs to spin-down promptly as dictated by the Onsager-Feynman equation, whereas their lowest energy state grants SBs lifetimes that are comparable to those of protons. The extraordinary long lifetimes suggests that conglomeration of SuSu-objects would evolve over several big bang events to possibly form dark matter halos that embed the galaxies in the observable universe. Having pulsars been converted into SuSu-objects, which is predicted to last for one Gyr or even shorter, then they become extraordinary compact and turn invisible. It turns out that recent observations on the quantum, stellar and cosmological scales remarkably support the present scenario.",17,[],1

1710.07687,astro-ph,"The fall of the Annama meteorite occurred early morning (local time) on April 19, 2014 on the Kola Peninsula (Russia).

Its cosmic ray exposure history is atypical as it is not part of the large group of H chondrites with a prominent 7 - 8 Ma peak in the exposure age histograms. Instead, its exposure age is within uncertainty of a smaller peak at 30  4 Ma. The results from short-lived radionuclides are compatible with an atmosperic pre-entry radius of 30 - 40 cm. However, based on noble gas and cosmogenic radionuclide data, Annama must have been part of a larger body (radius >65 cm) for a large part of its cosmic ray exposure history.

1706.03067,astro-ph,"We present the data reduction pipeline for CHARIS, a high-contrast integral-field spectrograph for the Subaru Telescope. The pipeline constructs a ramp from the raw reads using the measured nonlinear pixel response, and reconstructs the data cube using one of three extraction algorithms: aperture photometry, optimal extraction, or equation fitting. We measure and apply both a detector flatfield and a lenslet flatfield and reconstruct the wavelength- and position-dependent lenslet point-spread function (PSF) from images taken with a tunable laser. We use these measured PSFs to implement a equation-based extraction of the data cube, with typical residuals of ~5% due to imperfect models of the undersampled lenslet PSFs. The full two-dimensional residual of the equation extraction allows us to model and remove correlated read noise, dramatically improving CHARIS' performance. The equation extraction produces a data cube that has been deconvolved with the line-spread function, and never performs any interpolations of either the data or the individual lenslet spectra. The extracted data cube also includes uncertainties for each spatial and spectral measurement. CHARIS' software is parallelized, written in Python and Cython, and freely available on github with a separate documentation page. Astrometric and spectrophotometric calibrations of the data cubes and PSF subtraction will be treated in a forthcoming paper.",17,[],1
1703.10175,astro-ph,"We study the correlation between the specific star formation rate of central galaxies and neighbour galaxies, also known as 'galactic conformity', out to 20 Mpc/h using three semi-analytic models (SAMs, one from L-GALAXIES and other two from GALFORM). The aim is to establish whether SAMs are able to show galactic conformity using different models and selection criteria. In all the models, when the selection of primary galaxies is based on an isolation criterion in real space, the mean fraction of quenched galaxies around quenched primary galaxies is higher than that around star-forming primary galaxies of the same stellar mass. The overall signal of conformity decreases when we remove satellites selected as primary galaxies, but the effect is much stronger in GALFORM models compared with the L-GALAXIES model. We find this difference is partially explained by the fact that in GALFORM once a galaxy becomes a satellite remains as such, whereas satellites can become centrals at a later time in L-GALAXIES. The signal of conformity decreases down to 60% in the L-GALAXIES model after removing central galaxies that were ejected from their host halo in the past. Galactic conformity is also influenced by primary galaxies at fixed stellar mass that reside in dark matter haloes of different masses. Finally, we explore a proxy of conformity between distinct haloes. In this case the conformity is weak beyond ~ 3 Mpc/h (<3% in L-GALAXIES, <1-2% in GALFORM models). Therefore, it seems difficult that conformity is directly related with a long-range effect.",17,[],1
1704.00184,astro-ph,"With approximately one ninth of Earth's mass, Mars is widely considered to be a stranded planetary embryo that never became a fully-grown planet. A currently popular planet formation theory predicts that Mars formed near Earth and Venus and was subsequently scattered outwards to its present location. In such a scenario, the compositions of the three planets are expected to be similar to each other. However, bulk elemental and isotopic data for martian meteorites demonstrate that key aspects of Mars' composition are markedly different from that of Earth. This suggests that Mars formed outside of the terrestrial feeding zone during primary accretion. It is therefore probable that Mars always remained significantly farther from the Sun than Earth; its growth was stunted early and its mass remained relatively low. Here we identify a potential dynamical pathway that forms Mars in the asteroid belt and keeps it outside of Earth's accretion zone while at the same time accounting for strict age and compositional constraints, as well as mass differences. Our uncommon pathway (approximately 2% probability) is based on the Grand Tack scenario of terrestrial planet formation, in which the radial migration by Jupiter gravitationally sculpts the planetesimal disc at Mars' current location. We conclude that Mars' formation requires a specific dynamical pathway, while this is less valid for Earth and Venus. We further predict that Mars' volatile budget is most likely different from Earth's and that Venus formed close enough to our planet that it is expected to have a nearly identical composition from common building blocks.",17,[],1
1707.08129,astro-ph,"The kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (kSZ) and polarized Sunyaev Zel'dovich (pSZ) effects are temperature and polarization anisotropies induced by the scattering of CMB photons from structure in the post-reionization Universe. In the case of the kSZ effect, small angular scale anisotropies in the optical depth are modulated by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole field, i.e. the CMB dipole observed at each spacetime point, which is sourced by the primordial dipole and especially the local peculiar velocity. In the case of the pSZ effect, similar small-scale anisotropies are modulated by the CMB quadrupole field, which receives contributions from both scalar and tensor modes. Statistical anisotropies in the cross correlations of CMB temperature and polarization with tracers of the inhomogeneous distribution of electrons provide a means of isolating and reconstructing the dipole and quadrupole fields. In this paper, we present a set of unbiased minimum variance quadratic estimators for the reconstruction of the dipole and quadrupole fields, and forecast the ability of future CMB experiments and large scale structure surveys to perform this reconstruction. Consistent with previous work, we find that a high fidelity reconstruction of the dipole and quadrupole fields over a variety of scales is indeed possible, and demonstrate the sensitivity of the pSZ effect to primordial tensor modes. Using a principle component analysis, we estimate how many independent modes could be accessed in such a reconstruction. We also comment on a few first applications of a detection of the dipole and quadrupole fields, including a reconstruction of the primordial contribution to our locally observed CMB dipole, a test of statistical homogeneity on large scales from the first modes of the quadrupole field, and a reconstruction technique for the primordial potential on the largest scales.",17,"['gr-qc', 'hep-ph', 'hep-th']",1

Contact and bow shock waves are visible in the simulations from both the initial short jet pulse which creates the nearly spherical bow shock bubble and from the fast micro-jet, while a terminal Mach disk shock is visible near the tip of the continuous micro-jet, which reduces the jet gas velocity down to the flow velocity of the contact discontinuity at the leading edge of the jet.

Our predictions are model independent in the sense that we do not rely on a specific parametrization, but we instead use a principal component (PC) basis function constructed a priori from a noise model of supernovae and Cosmic Microwave Background observations. For the supernovae measurements, we consider two type of surveys: the current JLA and the upcoming WFIRST surveys. We show that WFIRST will be able to improve growth predictions in curved models significantly. The remaining degeneracy between spatial curvature and equation could be overcome with improved measurements of equation, a combination that controls the amplitude of the growth of structure.

1701.09072,astro-ph,"The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects are produced by the interaction of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons with the ionized and diffuse gas of electrons inside galaxy clusters integrated along the line of sight. The two main effects are the thermal SZ (tSZ) produced by thermal pressure inside galaxy clusters and the kinetic SZ (kSZ) produce by peculiar motion of galaxy clusters compared to CMB rest-frame. The kSZ effect is particularly challenging to measure as it follows the same spectral behavior as the CMB, and consequently can not be separated from the CMB using spectral considerations. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of detecting the kSZ through the computation of the tSZ-CMB-CMB cross-correlation bispectrum for current and future CMB experiments. We conclude that next generation of CMB experiments will offer the possibility to detect at high S/N the tSZ-kSZ-kSZ bispectrum. This measurement will constraints the intra-cluster dynamics and the velocity field of galaxy cluster that is extremely sensitive to the growth rate of structures and thus to dark energy properties.

The planet's mass Mp= 13.4-0.9 MJ places it right at the deuterium burning limit, i.e., the conventional boundary between ""planets"" and ""brown dwarfs"". Its existence raises the question of whether such objects are really ""planets"" (formed within the disks of their hosts) or ""failed stars"" (low mass objects formed by gas fragmentation). This question may ultimately be addressed by comparing disk and bulge/bar planets, which is a goal of the Spitzer microlens program. The host is a G dwarf Mhost = 0.89-0.07 Msun and the planet has a semi-major axis a~2.0 AU. We use Kepler K2 Campaign 9 microlensing data to break the lens-mass degeneracy that generically impacts parallax solutions from Earth-Spitzer observations alone, which is the first successful application of this approach. The microlensing data, derived primarily from near-continuous, ultra-dense survey observations from OGLE, MOA, and three KMTNet telescopes, contain more orbital information than for any previous microlensing planet, but not quite enough to accurately specify the full orbit.

In recent work, delensing with large-scale structure tracers has emerged as a promising method both for improving constraints on IGWs and for testing delensing methods for future use. However, the delensing fractions (i.e., the fraction of the lensing-B mode power removed) achieved by recent efforts have been only equation. In this work, we provide a detailed characterization of a full-sky, dust-cleaned cosmic infrared background (CIB) map for delensing and construct a further-improved delensing template by adding additional tracers to increase delensing performance. In particular, we build a multitracer delensing template by combining the dust-cleaned Planck CIB map with a reconstructed CMB lensing map from Planck and a galaxy number density map from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satellite. For this combination, we calculate the relevant weightings by fitting smooth templates to measurements of all the cross- and auto-spectra of these maps. On a large fraction of the sky (equation), we demonstrate that our maps are capable of providing a delensing factor of equation; using a more restrictive mask (equation), the delensing factor reaches equation. For low-noise surveys, our delensing maps, which cover much of the sky, can thus improve constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio (equation) by nearly a factor of 2.

1705.03020,astro-ph,"High quality reconstructions of the three dimensional velocity and density fields of the local Universe are essential to study the local Large Scale Structure. In this paper, the Wiener Filter reconstruction technique is applied to galaxy radial peculiar velocity catalogs to understand how the Hubble constant (H0) value and the grouping scheme affect the reconstructions. While H0 is used to derive radial peculiar velocities from galaxy distance measurements and total velocities, the grouping scheme serves the purpose of removing non linear motions. Two different grouping schemes (based on the literature and a systematic algorithm) as well as five H0 values ranging from 72 to 76 km/s/Mpc are selected. The Wiener Filter is applied to the resulting catalogs. Whatever grouping scheme is used, the larger H0 is, the larger the infall onto the local Volume is. However, this conclusion has to be strongly mitigated: a bias minimization scheme applied to the catalogs after grouping suppresses this effect. At fixed H0, reconstructions obtained with catalogs grouped with the different schemes exhibit structures at the proper location in both cases but the latter are more contrasted in the less aggressive scheme case: having more constraints permits an infall from both sides onto the structures to reinforce their overdensity. Such findings highlight the importance of a balance between grouping to suppress non linear motions and preserving constraints to produce an infall onto structures expected to be large overdensities. Such an observation is promising to perform constrained simulations of the local Universe including its massive clusters.",17,[],1

Here we find that, even if GRB-like central engines operate in both SNe Ib and Ic, different properties of their envelopes may accommodate this potential tension. In particular, we focus on the case of a low-mass, extended envelope surrounding the progenitor star (as produced, for example, by strong mass losses prior to explosion). If the envelopes of Type Ib SNe are sufficiently massive (equation) and extended (equation), we show that (i) GRB-like jets cannot break out of the star; (ii) the SN light curve is compatible with current observations.

1708.03729,astro-ph,"Recently, a precise (sub-arcsecond) localization of the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) 121102 has led to the discovery of persistent radio and optical counterparts, the identification of a host dwarf galaxy at a redshift of equation, and several campaigns of searches for higher-frequency counterparts, which gave only upper limits on the emission flux. Although the origin of FRBs remains unknown, most of the existing theoretical models are associated with pulsars, or more specifically, magnetars. In this paper, we explore persistent high-energy emission from a rapidly rotating highly magnetized pulsar associated with FRB 121102 if internal gradual magnetic dissipation occurs in the pulsar wind. We find that the efficiency of converting the spin-down luminosity to the high-energy (e.g., X-ray) luminosity is generally much smaller than unity, even for a millisecond magnetar. This provides an explanation for the non-detection of high-energy counterparts to FRB 121102.

By using the component N III 4640.64/4641.84 A we measure Kem = 102 -6 km/s. This highly significant detection ( >13 sigma) is fully compatible with the true companion star radial velocity obtained from near-infrared spectroscopy during quiescence. Combining these two velocities we determine, for the first time, the accretion disc opening angle and its associated error from direct spectroscopic measurements and detailed modelling, obtaining alpha = 15.5 2.5 -5 deg. This value is consistent with theoretical work if significant X-ray irradiation is taken into account and is important in the light of recent observations of GX339-4, where discrepant results were obtained between the donor's intrinsic radial velocity and the Bowen-inferred value.

The models show that stagnant lid planets with initial radiogenic heating rates of 100-250 TW, and with total COequation budgets ranging from equation times Earth's estimated COequation budget, can maintain volcanic outgassing rates suitable for habitability for equation Gyrs; larger COequation budgets result in uninhabitably hot climates, while smaller budgets result in global glaciation. High radiogenic heat production rates favor habitability by sustaining volcanism and COequation outgassing longer. Thus, the results suggest that plate tectonics may not be required for establishing a long-term carbon cycle and maintaining a stable, habitable climate. The model is necessarily highly simplified, as the uncertainties with exoplanet thermal evolution and outgassing are large. Nevertheless, the results provide some first order guidance for future exoplanet missions, by predicting the age at which habitability becomes unlikely for a stagnant lid planet as a function of initial radiogenic heat budget. This prediction is powerful because both planet heat budget and age can potentially be constrained from stellar observations.",17,[],1
1704.00787,astro-ph,"We present ALMA observations of the 0.88 millimeter dust continuum, 13CO, and C18O J=3-2 line emission of the circumbinary disk HD142527 at a spatial resolution of about 0.25"". This system is characterized by a large central cavity of roughly 120 AU in radius, and asymmetric dust and gas emission. By comparing the observations with theoretical models, we find that the azimuthal variations in gas and dust density reach a contrast of 54 for dust grains and 3.75 for CO molecules, with an extreme gas-to-dust ratio of 1.7 on the dust crescent. We point out that caution is required in interpreting continuum subtracted maps of the line emission as this process might result in removing a large fraction of the line emission. Radially, we find that both the gas and dust surface densities can be described by Gaussians, centered at the same disk radius, and with gas profiles wider than for the dust. These results strongly support a scenario in which millimeter dust grains are radially and azimuthally trapped toward the center of a gas pressure bump. Finally, our observations reveal a compact source of continuum and CO emission inside the dust depleted cavity at about 50 AU from the primary star. The kinematics of the CO emission from this region is different from that expected from material in Keplerian rotation around the binary system, and might instead trace a compact disk around a third companion. Higher angular resolution observations are required to investigate the nature of this source.",17,[],1
1706.07871,astro-ph,"We study the dependence of the galaxy content of dark matter halos on large-scale environment and halo formation time using semi-analytic galaxy models applied to the Millennium simulation. We analyze subsamples of halos at the extremes of these distributions and measure the occupation functions for the galaxies they host. We find distinct differences in these occupation functions. The main effect with environment is that central galaxies (and in one model also the satellites) in denser regions start populating lower-mass halos. A similar, but significantly stronger, trend exists with halo age, where early-forming halos are more likely to host central galaxies at lower halo mass. We discuss the origin of these trends and the connection to the stellar mass -- halo mass relation. We find that, at fixed halo mass, older halos and to some extent also halos in dense environments tend to host more massive galaxies. Additionally, we see a reverse trend for the satellite galaxies occupation where early-forming halos have fewer satellites, likely due to having more time for them to merge with the central galaxy. We describe these occupancy variations also in terms of the changes in the occupation function parameters, which can aid in constructing realistic mock galaxy catalogs. Finally, we study the corresponding galaxy auto- and cross-correlation functions of the different samples and elucidate the impact of assembly bias on galaxy clustering. Our results can inform theoretical models of assembly bias and attempts to detect it in the real universe.",17,[],1
1703.08798,astro-ph,"Axion-like particles (ALPs) might constitute the totality of the cold dark matter (CDM) observed. The parameter space of ALPs depends on the mass of the particle equation and on the energy scale of inflation equation , the latter being bound by the non-detection of primordial gravitational waves. We show that the bound on HI implies the existence of a mass scale equation, depending on the ALP susceptibility equation, such that the energy density of ALPs of mass smaller than equation is too low to explain the present CDM budget, if the ALP field has originated after the end of inflation. This bound affects Ultra-Light Axions (ULAs), which have recently regained popularity as CDM candidates. Light (equation) ALPs can then be CDM candidates only if the ALP field has already originated during the inflationary period, in which case the parameter space is constrained by the non-detection of axion isocurvature fluctuations. We comment on the effects on these bounds from additional physics beyond the Standard Model, besides ALPs.",17,[],1
1706.01794,astro-ph,"Large pulsar glitches (like the ones detected in the Vela) are though to be a consequence of the superfluid component present in the interior of mature neutron stars. However strong entrainment challenges this picture. We study the impact of entrainment on the angular momentum that can be exchanged between the normal component and the superfluid during a glitch by means of a consistent global model. This allows to estimate the maximum angular momentum reservoir stored into the superfluid component of the star: the essential ingredient are newly calculated mesoscopic pinning forces that block the superfluid vorticity in the crust of the neutron star. This method can also provide a quantitative test for global models of rotating neutron stars, as well as for microphysical inputs present in literature (like entrainment parameters and pinning forces).",17,[],1
1705.10521,astro-ph,"The star formation properties of early-type galaxies (ETGs) are currently the subject of considerable interest, particularly whether they differ from those of gas-rich spirals. We perform a systematic study of star formation in a large sample of local ETGs using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and dust emission, focusing on the galaxies' star formation rates (SFRs) and star formation efficiencies (SFEs). Our sample is composed of the 260 ETGs from the ATLAS3D survey, from which we use the cold gas measurements (HI and CO). The SFRs are estimated from stellar, PAH and dust fits to spectral energy distributions created from new AKARI measurements and literature data from WISE and 2MASS. The mid-infrared luminosities of non-CO-detected galaxies are well correlated with their stellar luminosities, showing that they trace (circum)stellar dust emission. CO-detected galaxies show an excess above these correlations, uncorrelated with their stellar luminosities, indicating that they likely contain PAHs and dust of interstellar origin. PAH and dust luminosities of CO-detected galaxies show tight correlations with their molecular gas masses, and the derived current SFRs are typically 0.01-1 Msun/yr. These SFRs systematically decrease with stellar age at fixed stellar mass, while they correlate nearly linearly with stellar mass at fixed age. The majority of local ETGs follow the same star-formation law as local star-forming galaxies, and their current SFEs do not depend on either stellar mass or age. Our results clearly indicate that molecular gas is fueling current star formation in local ETGs, that appear to acquire this gas via mechanisms regulated primarily by stellar mass. The current SFEs of local ETGs are similar to those of local star-forming galaxies, indicating that their low SFRs are likely due to smaller cold gas fractions rather than a suppression of star formation.",17,[],1
1703.06143,astro-ph,"Galaxy mergers are likely to play a role in triggering active galactic nuclei (AGN), but the conditions under which this process occurs are poorly understood. In Paper I, we constructed a sample of spatially offset X-ray AGN that represent galaxy mergers hosting a single AGN. In this paper, we use our offset AGN sample to constrain the parameters that affect AGN observability in galaxy mergers. We also construct dual AGN samples with similar selection properties for comparison. We find that the offset AGN fraction shows no evidence for a dependence on AGN luminosity, while the dual AGN fractions show stronger evidence for a positive dependence, suggesting that the merger events forming dual AGN are more efficient at instigating accretion onto supermassive black holes than those forming offset AGN. We also find that the offset and dual AGN fractions both have a negative dependence on nuclear separation and are similar in value at small physical scales. This dependence may become stronger when restricted to high AGN luminosities, though a larger sample is needed for confirmation. These results indicate that the probability of AGN triggering increases at later merger stages. This study is the first to systematically probe down to nuclear separations of <1 kpc (~0.8 kpc) and is consistent with predictions from simulations that AGN observability peaks in this regime. We also find that the offset AGN are not preferentially obscured compared to the parent AGN sample, suggesting that our selection may be targeting galaxy mergers with relatively dust-free nuclear regions.",17,[],1
1703.02374,astro-ph,"The surprising thinness of the solar tachocline is still not understood with certainty today. Among the numerous possible scenarios suggested to explain its radial confinement, one hypothesis is based on Maxwell stresses that are exerted by the cyclic dynamo magnetic field of the Sun penetrating over a skin depth below the turbulent convection zone. Our goal is to assess under which conditions (turbulence level in the tachocline, strength of the dynamo-generated field, spreading mechanism) this scenario can be realized in the solar tachocline. We develop a simplified 1D model of the upper tachocline under the influence of an oscillating magnetic field imposed from above. The turbulent transport is parametrized with enhanced turbulent diffusion (or anti-diffusion) coefficients. Two main processes that thicken the tachocline are considered; either turbulent viscous spreading or radiative spreading. An extensive parameter study is carried out to establish the physical parameter regimes under which magnetic confinement of the tachocline that is due to a surface dynamo field can be realized. We have explored a large range of magnetic field amplitudes, viscosities, ohmic diffusivities and thermal diffusivities. We find that, for large but still realistic magnetic field strengths, the differential rotation can be suppressed in the upper radiative zone (and hence the tachocline confined) if weak turbulence is present (with an enhanced ohmic diffusivity of equation), even in the presence of radiative spreading. Our results show that a dynamo magnetic field can, in the presence of weak turbulence, prevent the inward burrowing of a tachocline subject to viscous diffusion or radiative spreading.",17,[],1
1712.06265,astro-ph,"A combined interpretation of the CALET equation spectrum up to 3 TeV and the AMS-02 positron spectrum up to 500 GeV was performed and the results are discussed. To parametrize the background electron flux, we assume a smoothly broken power-law spectrum with an exponential cut-off for electrons and fit this parametrization to the measurements, with either a pulsar or 3-body decay of fermionic Dark Matter as the extra electron-positron pair source responsible for the positron excess. We found that depending on the parameters for the background, both Dark Matter decay and the pulsar model can explain the combined measurements. While the Dark Matter decay scenario is constrained by the Fermi-LAT equation-ray measurement, we show that 3-body decay of a 800 GeV Dark Matter can be compatible with the equation-ray flux measurement. We discuss the capability of CALET to discern decaying Dark Matter models from a generic pulsar source scenario, based on simulated data for five years of data-taking.",17,[],1
1708.07287,astro-ph,"Discs around young planets, so-called circumplanetary discs (CPDs), are essential for planet growth, satellite formation, and planet detection. We study the millimetre and centimetre emission from accreting CPDs by using the simple equation disc model. We find that it is easier to detect CPDs at shorter radio wavelengths (e.g. equation 1 mm). For example, if the system is 140 pc away from us, deep observations (e.g. 5 hours) at ALMA Band 7 (0.87 mm) are sensitive to as small as 0.03 lunar mass of dust in CPDs. If the CPD is around a Jupiter mass planet 20 AU away from the host star and has equation, ALMA can detect this disc when it accretes faster than equation. ALMA can also detect the ""minimum mass sub-nebulae"" disc if such a disc exists around a young planet in YSOs. However, to distinguish the embedded compact CPD from the circumstellar disc material, we should observe circumstellar discs with large gaps/cavities using the highest resolution possible. We also calculate the CPD fluxes at VLA bands, and discuss the possibility of detecting radio emission from jets/winds launched in CPDs. Finally we argue that, if the radial drift of dust particles is considered, the drifting timescale for millimetre dust in CPDs can be extremely short. It only takes 10equation-10equation years for CPDs to lose millimetre dust. Thus, for CPDs to be detectable at radio wavelengths, mm-sized dust in CPDs needs to be replenished continuously, or the disc has a significant fraction of micron-sized dust or a high gas surface density so that the particle drifting timescale is long, or the radial drift is prevented by other means (e.g. pressure traps).",17,[],1
1707.04259,astro-ph,"To improve our understanding of high-z galaxies we study the impact of Hequation chemistry on their evolution, morphology and observed properties. We compare two zoom-in high-resolution (30 pc) simulations of prototypical equation galaxies at equation. The first, ""Dahlia"", adopts an equilibrium model for Hequation formation, while the second, ""Alth\aea"", features an improved non-equilibrium chemistry network. The star formation rate (SFR) of the two galaxies is similar (within 50\%), and increases with time reaching values close to 100 equation at equation. They both have SFR-stellar mass relation consistent with observations, and a specific SFR of equation. The main differences arise in the gas properties. The non-equilibrium chemistry determines the Hequation Hequation~transition to occur at densities equation, i.e. about 10 times larger than predicted by the equilibrium model used for Dahlia. As a result, Alth\aea features a more clumpy and fragmented morphology, in turn making SN feedback more effective. Also, because of the lower density and weaker feedback, Dahlia sits equation away from the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation; Alth\aea, instead nicely agrees with observations. The different gas properties result in widely different observables. Alth\aea outshines Dahlia by a factor of 7 (15) in [CII]~equation (Hequation~equation) line emission. Yet, Alth\aea is under-luminous with respect to the locally observed [CII]-SFR relation. Whether this relation does not apply at high-z or the line luminosity is reduced by CMB and metallicity effects remains as an open question.",17,[],1
1701.02769,astro-ph,"We present a catalogue of candidate H\alpha emission and absorption line sources and blue objects in the Galactic Bulge Survey (GBS) region. We use a point source catalogue of the GBS fields (two strips of (l x b) = (6 x 1) degrees centred at b = 1.5 above and below the Galactic centre), covering the magnitude range 16 < r' < 22.5. We utilize (r'-i', r'-H\alpha) colour-colour diagrams to select H\alpha emission and absorption line candidates, and also identify blue objects (compared to field stars) using the r'-i' colour index. We identify 1337 H\alpha emission line candidates and 336 H\alpha absorption line candidates. These catalogues likely contain a plethora of sources, ranging from active (binary) stars, early-type emission line objects, cataclysmic variables (CVs) and low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) to background active galactic nuclei (AGN). The 389 blue objects we identify are likely systems containing a compact object, such as CVs, planetary nebulae and LMXBs. Hot subluminous dwarfs (sdO/B stars) are also expected to be found as blue outliers. Crossmatching our outliers with the GBS X-ray catalogue yields sixteen sources, including seven (magnetic) CVs and one qLMXB candidate among the emission line candidates, and one background AGN for the absorption line candidates. One of the blue outliers is a high state AM CVn system. Spectroscopic observations combined with the multi-wavelength coverage of this area, including X-ray, ultraviolet and (time-resolved) optical and infrared observations, can be used to further constrain the nature of individual sources.",17,[],1

1701.07843,astro-ph,"Emission signatures from galactic winds provide an opportunity to directly map the outflowing gas, but this is traditionally challenging because of the low surface brightness. Using deep observations (27 hours) of the Hubble Deep Field South from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument, we identify signatures of an outflow in both emission and absorption from a spatially resolved galaxy at z = 1.29 with a stellar mass M* = 8 x 109 Msun, star formation rate SFR = 77 Msun/yr, and star formation rate surface brightness 1.6 Msun/kpc2 within the [OII] half-light radius R1/2,[OII] = 2.76 - 0.17 kpc. From a component of the strong resonant MgII and FeII absorptions at -350 km/s, we infer a mass outflow rate that is comparable to the star formation rate. We detect non-resonant FeII* emission, at lambda 2626, 2612, 2396, and 2365, at 1.2-2.4-1.5-2.7 x 10-18 egs s-1 cm-2 respectively. These flux ratios are consistent with the expectations for optically thick gas. By combining the four non-resonant FeII* emission lines, we spatially map the FeII* emission from an individual galaxy for the first time. The FeII* emission has an elliptical morphology that is roughly aligned with the galaxy minor kinematic axis, and its integrated half-light radius R1/2,FeII* = 4.1 - 0.4 kpc is 50% larger than the stellar continuum (R1/2,* = 2.34 - 0.17 kpc) or the [OII] nebular line. Moreover, the FeII* emission shows a blue wing extending up to -400 km/s, which is more pronounced along the galaxy minor kinematic axis and reveals a C-shaped pattern in a p-v diagram along that axis.

The abundance ratios of the three equationC isotopologues in L1521B are derived to be [HequationCCCN]:[HCequationCCN]:[HCCequationCN] = 0.98 (- 0.14) : 1.00 : 1.52 (- 0.16) (1 sigma). The fractionation pattern is consistent with that at the cyanopolyyne peak in Taurus Molecular Cloud-1.

Third, there exist attractive prospects for accurately measuring both the sky-projected stellar spin-orbit angles as well as the mutual orbital inclination between the planets in the system.

1709.01078,astro-ph,"We address the turbulent fragmentation scenario for the origin of the stellar initial mass function (IMF), using a large set of numerical simulations of randomly driven supersonic MHD turbulence. The turbulent fragmentation model successfully predicts the main features of the observed stellar IMF assuming an isothermal equation of state without any stellar feedback. As a test of the model, we focus on the case of a magnetized isothermal gas, neglecting stellar feedback, while pursuing a large dynamic range in both space and timescales covering the full spectrum of stellar masses from brown dwarfs to massive stars. Our simulations represent a generic 4 pc region within a typical Galactic molecular cloud, with a mass of 3000 Msun and an rms velocity 10 times the isothermal sound speed and 5 times the average Alfven velocity, in agreement with observations. We achieve a maximum resolution of 50 au and a maximum duration of star formation of 4.0 Myr, forming up to a thousand sink particles whose mass distribution closely matches the observed stellar IMF. A large set of medium-size simulations is used to test the sink particle algorithm, while larger simulations are used to test the numerical convergence of the IMF and the dependence of the IMF turnover on physical parameters predicted by the turbulent fragmentation model. We find a clear trend toward numerical convergence and strong support for the model predictions, including the initial time evolution of the IMF. We conclude that the physics of isothermal MHD turbulence is sufficient to explain the origin of the IMF.",17,[],1

1702.01158,astro-ph,"We present general relativistic radiation MHD simulations of super-Eddington accretion on a equation black hole. We consider a range of mass accretion rates, black hole spins, and magnetic field configurations. We compute the spectra and images of the models as a function of viewing angle, and compare them with the observed properties of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). The models easily produce apparent luminosities in excess of equation for pole-on observers. However, the angle-integrated radiative luminosities rarely exceed equation even for mass accretion rates of tens of Eddington. The systems are thus radiatively inefficient, though they are energetically efficient when the energy output in winds and jets is also counted. The simulated models reproduce the main empirical types of spectra --- disk-like, supersoft, soft, hard --- observed in ULXs. The magnetic field configuration, whether MAD (""magnetically arrested disk"") or SANE (""standard and normal evolution""), has a strong effect on the results. In SANE models, the X-ray spectral hardness is almost independent of accretion rate, but decreases steeply with increasing inclination. MAD models with non-spinning black holes produce significantly softer spectra at higher values of equation, even at low inclinations. MAD models with rapidly spinning black holes are quite different from all other models. They are radiatively efficient (efficiency factor equation), super-efficient when the mechanical energy output is also included (equation), and produce hard blazar-like spectra.

Critical to the experiment is the manner in which the sky signal is represented through the instrument.

In particular, the observed behaviors are succesfully simulated by means of an adiabatic master equation, with time averaged dephasing (Lindblad) operators. The time average is tentatively interpeted in terms of the finite time resolution of the continuous measurement.",17,['quant-ph'],8
1707.05578,cond-mat,"Polymorph of 8-Pmmn borophene exhibits anisotropic tilted Dirac cones. In this work, we explore the consequences of the tilted Dirac cones in magnetotransport properties of a periodically modulated borophene. We evaluate modulation induced diffusive conductivity by using linear response theory in low temperature regime. The application of weak modulation (electric/magnetic or both) gives rise to the magnetic field dependent non-zero oscillatory drift velocity which causes Weiss oscillation in the longitudinal conductivity at low magnetic field. The Weiss oscillation is studied in presence of an weak spatial electric, magnetic and both modulations individually. The tilting of the Dirac cones gives rise to additional contribution to the Weiss oscillation in longitudinal conductivity. Moreover, it also enhances the frequency of the Weiss oscillation and modifies its amplitude too. Most remarkably, It is found that the presence of out-of phase both i.e., electric and magnetic modulations can cause a sizable valley polarization in diffusive conductivity. The origin of valley polarization lies in the opposite tilting of the two Dirac cones at two valleys.",17,[],8

For an even number of particles, the susceptibilities show maxima in their temperature dependence. An odd number produces an additional free spin response that dominates at low temperatures. This free spin response for odd equation also produces a step in the magnetization per particle at equation.

Using Monte Carlo simulation, we document the low-temperature formation of aggregates of guests (clusters) held together by dimers, whose typical size and shape depend on the guest concentration equation. For low equation (less than equation), most guests are isolated and coated with a layer of dimers. As equation progressively increases, clusters grow in size becoming more and more elongated and polydisperse; after reaching a shallow maximum for equation, the size of clusters again reduces upon increasing equation further. In one case only (equation and moderately low temperature) the mixture relaxed to a fluid of lamellae, suggesting that in this case clusters are metastable with respect to crystal-vapor separation.

Although in principle one could turn to Wilson loops and long-range entanglement, evaluating these non-local observables at many points in phase space can be prohibitively costly. With growing excitement over topological quantum computation comes the need for an efficient approach for obtaining topological phase diagrams. Here we turn to machine learning using quantum loop topography (QLT), a notion we have recently introduced. Specifically, we propose a construction of QLT that is sensitive to quasi-particle statistics. We then use mutual statistics between the spinons and visons to detect a equation quantum spin liquid in a multi-parameter phase space. We successfully obtain the quantum phase boundary between the topological and trivial phases using a simple feed-forward neural network.

We reveal the phenomena that govern the behavior of this type of device and show significant departure from the simple expectations based on vertical transitions. We find strong focusing of the electromagnetic fields at the contact edges over the same length scale as the band-bending. Both of these spatially-varying potentials lead to an enhancement of non-vertical optical transitions, which dominate even the absence of phonon or impurity scattering.

As proof of concept, we calculate the energy of a N\'eel skyrmion in an ultra-thin Co/Pt dot, and we find that the dipolar contribution cannot be neglected and that both Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and anisotropy play an important role to stabilize the skyrmion.

Simple theoretical models that accurately capture non-diffusive transport physics are valuable for experimental analysis, technology design, and providing physical insight. In this work, we utilize and extend the McKelvey-Shockley (McK-S) flux method, a simple and accurate framework, to investigate ballistic effects in transient phonon transport submitted to a spatially sinusoidal heating profile, simulating a transient thermal grating. We begin by extending a previous McK-S formulation to include inelastic scattering, then obtain an analytical solution in the single phonon energy case (gray approximation), and after show how this approach can readily support a full phonon dispersion and mean-free-path distribution. The results agree with experimental data and compare very well to solutions of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation in the diffusive and weakly quasi-ballistic transport regimes. We discuss the role of ballistic and non-equilibrium physics, and show that inelastic scattering is key to retrieving the heat equation solution in the diffusive limit.

Two out-band localized modes of the harmonic model, which make no contributions to local temperature due to the absence of phonon interactions, result in the concave temperature profile and over-cooling effect. For the anharmonic model, thanks to the phonon-phonon interactions, the localized modes are excited and make considerable contributions to interfacial temperature, which is clearly shown by examining the temperature accumulation function.

1705.09190,cond-mat,"We develop a no-go theorem for two-dimensional bosonic systems with crystal symmetries: if there is a half-integer spin at a rotation center, where the point-group symmetry is equation, such a system must have a ground-state degeneracy protected by the crystal symmetry. Such a degeneracy indicates either a broken-symmetry state or a unconventional state of matter. Comparing to the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis Theorem, our result counts the spin at each rotation center, instead of the total spin per unit cell, and therefore also applies to certain systems with an even number of half-integer spins per unit cell.",17,[],8

HD varies inversely with MS in both of the films, while the HF becomes liner dependent on 1/MS in the annealed film.

The algorithm is based on two well known methods in the literature, firstly that of the so-called Recursive Green's Function (RGF) and secondly that of Buttiker probes. Numerical methods for exact evaluation of the Jacobian are presented by a direct extension to RGF which can be modularly included in any codebase that uses it presently. Then using both physical observations and numerical methods, the computation time of the Buttiker probe Jacobian is improved significantly. An improvement to existing phonon models within Buttiker probes is then demonstrated in the simulation of fully atomistic graphene nanoribbon based field effect transistors in n-i-n and p-i-n operation.",17,[],8
1703.02050,cond-mat,"The past decade's apparent success in predicting and experimentally discovering distinct classes of topological insulators (TIs) and semimetals masks a fundamental shortcoming: out of 200,000 stoichiometric compounds extant in material databases, only several hundred of them are topologically nontrivial. Are TIs that esoteric, or does this reflect a fundamental problem with the current piecemeal approach to finding them? To address this, we propose a new and complete electronic band theory that highlights the link between topology and local chemical bonding, and combines this with the conventional band theory of electrons. Topological Quantum Chemistry is a description of the universal global properties of all possible band structures and materials, comprised of a graph theoretical description of momentum space and a dual group theoretical description in real space. We classify the possible band structures for all 230 crystal symmetry groups that arise from local atomic orbitals, and show which are topologically nontrivial. We show how our topological band theory sheds new light on known TIs, and demonstrate the power of our method to predict a plethora of new TIs.",17,['hep-th'],8
1708.04960,cond-mat,"An interacting bilayer electron system provides an extended platform to study electron-electron interaction beyond single layers. We report here experiments demonstrating that the layer densities of an asymmetric bilayer electron system oscillate as a function of perpendicular magnetic field that quantizes the energy levels. At intermediate fields, this interlayer charge transfer can be well explained by the alignment of the Landau levels in the two layers. At the highest fields where both layers reach the extreme quantum limit, however, there is an anomalous, enhanced charge transfer to the majority layer. Surprisingly, when the minority layer becomes extremely dilute, this charge transfer slows down as the electrons in the minority layer condense into a Wigner crystal. Furthermore, by examining the quantum capacitance of the dilute layer at high fields, the screening induced by the composite fermions in an adjacent layer is unveiled. The results highlight the influence of strong interaction in interlayer charge transfer in the regime of very high fields and low Landau level filling factors.",17,[],8

After sending to zero the number of replicas they correspond to the renormalization group fixed points of the equation-state Potts model with quenched disorder. We find that all solutions with non-zero disorder possess equation-independent sectors, pointing to superuniversality (i.e. symmetry independence) of some critical exponents. The solution corresponding to the random bond ferromagnet, for which disorder vanishes as equation, allows for superuniversality of the correlation length exponent equation [PRL 118 (2017) 250601]. Of the two solutions which are strongly disordered for all values of equation, one is completely equation-independent and accounts for the zero-temperature percolation fixed point of the randomly bond diluted ferromagnet.

We show that topologically different parts of a directed network have different sensitivity to the addition and pruning of edges and vertices and, therefore, they are characterized by different susceptibilities. These susceptibilities diverge at the critical point of the directed percolation transition, signaling the appearance (or disappearance) of the giant strongly connected component in the infinite size limit. We demonstrate this behavior in randomly damaged real and synthetic directed complex networks, such as the World Wide Web, Twitter, the \emphCaenorhabditis elegans neural network, directed Erd\Hos-R\'enyi graphs, and others. We reveal a non-monotonous dependence of the sensitivity to random pruning of edges or vertices in the case of \emphCaenorhabditis elegans and Twitter that manifests specific structural peculiarities of these networks.

The PT symmetry breaking of the bound states leads to the PT transition, the PT-symmetric phases and the localized states were studied. In the broken PT-symmetric phase, all energy levels break simultaneously in topologically trivial phase; however, two edge states in topologically nontrivial phase are free from the influence of the PT-symmetric defects.

1705.01026,cond-mat,"Recent experiments have illustrated that long range two-body interactions can be induced by laser coupling atoms to highly excited Rydberg states. Stimulated by this achievement, we study supersolidity of lattice bosons in an experimentally relevant situation. In our setup, we consider two-component atoms on a square lattice, where one species is weakly dressed to an electronically high-lying (Rydberg) state, generating a tunable, soft-core shape long-range interaction. Interactions between atoms of the second species and between the two species are characterized by local inter- and intra-species interactions. Using a dynamical mean-field calculation, we find that interspecies onsite interactions can stabilize a pronounced region of supersolid phases. This is characterized by two distinctive types of supersolids, where the bare species forms supersolid phases that are immersed in strongly correlated quantum phases, i.e. a crystalline solid or supersolid of the dressed atoms. We show that the interspecies interaction leads to a roton-like instability in the bare species and therefore is crucially important to the supersolid formation.

The effective spin-spin interaction for this model in the strong correlation limit, is studied in terms of the generalized spin stiffness constant as a function of doping concentration. The plot of this generalized spin stiffness constant against doping shows a very high value of stiffness in the vicinity of zero doping and a very sharp fall with increase in doping concentration, signifying the rapid decay of original coupling of semi-localized spins in the system. Quite interestingly, this plot also shows a maximum occurring at a finite value of doping, which strongly suggests the tendency of the itinerant spins to couple again in the unconventional paramagnetic phase. As the doping is further increased, this new coupling is also suppressed and the spin response becomes analogous to almost Pauli-like. The last two predictions of ours are quite novel and may be directly tested by independent experiments and computational techniques in future.

Our experiments clearly show a field-induced phase transition occurring at equation equation 7.5 T, above which the zigzag magnetic order is completely suppressed. The minimum of thermal conductivity at 7.5 T is attributed to the strong scattering of phonons by the magnetic fluctuations.

1711.05990,cond-mat,"Recent numerical simulations of hard helical particle systems unveiled the existence of a novel chiral nematic phase, termed screw-like, characterised by the helical organization of the particle Cequation symmetry axes round the nematic director with periodicity equal to the particle pitch. This phase forms at high density and can follow a less dense uniform nematic phase, with relative occurrence of the two phases depending on the helix morphology. Since these numerical simulations were conducted under three-dimensional periodic boundary conditions, two questions could remain open. Firstly, the real nature of the lower density nematic phase, expected to be cholesteric. Secondly, the influence that the latter, once allowed to form, may have on the existence and stability of the screw-like nematic phase. To address these questions, we have performed Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics numerical simulations of helical particle systems confined between two parallel repulsive walls. We have found that removal of the periodicity constraint along one direction allows a relatively-long-pitch cholesteric phase to form, in lieu of the uniform nematic phase, with helical axis perpendicular to the walls while the existence and stability of the screw-like nematic phase are not appreciably affected by this change of boundary conditions.",17,[],8

We refer to this state as an incommensurate chirality density wave (XDW) phase, which represents a fundamentally new type of chiral symmetry breaking in the solid state. Drawing on parallels to the incommensurate ferroelectric transition of NaNOequation we suggest the XDW state arises through coupling between acoustic (shear) and molecular rotoinversion modes. Such coupling is symmetry-forbidden at the Brillouin zone centre but symmetry-allowed for small but finite modulation vectors equation.

1711.05100,cond-mat,"When describing the low-energy physics of bosons in a double-well potential with a high barrier between the wells and sufficiently weak atom-atom interactions, one can to a good approximation ignore the high energy states and thereby obtain an effective two-mode model. Here, we show that the regime in which the two-mode model is valid can be extended by adding an on-site three-body interaction term and a three-body interaction-induced tunneling term to the two-mode Hamiltonian. These terms effectively account for virtual transitions to the higher energy states. We determine appropriate strengths of the three-body terms by an optimization of the minimal value of the wave function overlap within a certain time window. Considering different initial states with three or four atoms, we find that the resulting model accurately captures the dynamics of the system for parameters where the two-mode model without the three-body terms is poor. We also investigate the dependence of the strengths of the three-body terms on the barrier height and the atom-atom interaction strength. The optimal three-body interaction strengths depend on the initial state of the system.",17,[],8

The considered charge (either the fermionic number or the relative density) is no longer conserved, leading to macroscopic fluctuations of the number of particles. We demonstrate that at phase transitions characterized by a linear dispersion, the BCF probe the change in a winding number that allows one to pinpoint the transition and corresponds to the topological invariant for standard models.

The fermions remain gapped across the transition, and our data support an emergent SO(4) symmetry unifying the two order parameters. While the bare symmetries of our model do not allow for spinon-carrying Zequation vortices in the Kekul\'e mass, the emergent SO(4) invariance permits an interpretation of the transition in terms of deconfined quantum criticality.

Upon simplification to isotropy, our model reduces to an explicit analytical form yielding insight into the behavior of equation with increasing velocity. We find that at the first shear wave speed within an isotropic solid, the screw dislocation line tension diverges positively indicating infinite stability. The edge dislocation line tension, on the other hand, changes sign at approximately equation of the first shear wave speed, and subsequently diverges negatively indicating that the straight configuration is energetically unstable.   In anisotropic crystals, the dependence of equation on the dislocation velocity is significantly more complex; At velocities approaching the first shear wave speed within the plane of the crystal defined by the dislocation line, equation tends to diverge, with the sign of the divergence strongly dependent on both the elastic properties of the crystal, and the orientation of the dislocation line. We interpret our analyses within the context of recent molecular dynamics simulations (MD) of the motion of dislocations near the first shear wave speed.

Our calculations of the Rabi oscillations between the doubly dressed spin states show that the maximum suppression of decoherence is achieved at the so-called Rabi resonance when the radio-field frequency is in resonance with the Rabi frequency of spins in the microwave field. This effect is feasible even in the absence of phase matching in the radiofrequency field and for different types of inhomogeneity of the microwave field.

We argue that if the learner could somehow know and take the label-quality into account when learning the data representation, we could get the best of both worlds. To this end, we propose ""fidelity-weighted learning"" (FWL), a semi-supervised student-teacher approach for training deep neural networks using weakly-labeled data. FWL modulates the parameter updates to a student network (trained on the task we care about) on a per-sample basis according to the posterior confidence of its label-quality estimated by a teacher (who has access to the high-quality labels).

How to enable SLAM robustly and durably on mobile, or even IoT grade devices, is the main challenge faced by the industry today. The main problems we need to address are: 1.) how to accelerate the SLAM pipeline to meet real-time requirements; and 2.) how to reduce SLAM energy consumption to extend battery life. After delving into the problem, we found out that feature extraction is indeed the bottleneck of performance and energy consumption.

1712.01928,cs,"We propose a novel framework called Semantics-Preserving Adversarial Embedding Network (SP-AEN) for zero-shot visual recognition (ZSL), where test images and their classes are both unseen during training. SP-AEN aims to tackle the inherent problem --- semantic loss --- in the prevailing family of embedding-based ZSL, where some semantics would be discarded during training if they are non-discriminative for training classes, but could become critical for recognizing test classes. Specifically, SP-AEN prevents the semantic loss by introducing an independent visual-to-semantic space embedder which disentangles the semantic space into two subspaces for the two arguably conflicting objectives: classification and reconstruction. Through adversarial learning of the two subspaces, SP-AEN can transfer the semantics from the reconstructive subspace to the discriminative one, accomplishing the improved zero-shot recognition of unseen classes. Comparing with prior works, SP-AEN can not only improve classification but also generate photo-realistic images, demonstrating the effectiveness of semantic preservation. On four popular benchmarks: CUB, AWA, SUN and aPY, SP-AEN considerably outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by an absolute performance difference of 12.2\%, 9.3\%, 4.0\%, and 3.6\% in terms of harmonic mean values",17,[],7
1712.09803,cs,"In the modern era of multicore processors, utilizing cores is a tedious job. Synchronization and communication among processors involve high cost. Software transaction memory systems (STMs) addresses this issues and provide better concurrency in which programmer need not have to worry about consistency issues. Another advantage of STMs is that they facilitate compositionality of concurrent programs with great ease. Different concurrent operations that need to be composed to form a single atomic unit is achieved by encapsulating them in a single transaction. In this paper, we introduce a new STM system as multi-version object based STM (MVOSTM) which is the combination of both of these ideas for harnessing greater concurrency in STMs. As the name suggests MVOSTM, works on a higher level and maintains multiple versions corresponding to each key. We have developed MVOSTM with the unlimited number of versions corresponding to each key. In addition to that, we have developed garbage collection for MVOSTM (MVOSTM-GC) to delete unwanted versions corresponding to the keys to reduce traversal overhead. MVOSTM provides greater concurrency while reducing the number of aborts and it ensures compositionality by making the transactions atomic. Here, we have used MVOSTM for the list and hash-table data structure as list-MVOSTM and HT- MVOSTM. Experimental results of list-MVOSTM outperform almost two to twenty fold speedup than existing state-of-the-art list based STMs (Trans-list, Boosting-list, NOrec-list, list-MVTO, and list-OSTM). HT-MVOSTM shows a significant performance gain of almost two to nineteen times better than existing state-of-the-art hash-table based STMs (ESTM, RWSTMs, HT-MVTO, and HT-OSTM). MVOSTM with list and hash-table shows the least number of aborts among all the existing STM algorithms. MVOSTM satisfies correctness-criteria as opacity.",17,[],7

In this paper, we study a linear type system designed with two crucial properties in mind: backwards-compatibility and code reuse across linear and non-linear users of a library. Only then can the benefits of linear types permeate conventional functional programming. Rather than bifurcate types into linear and non-linear counterparts, we instead attach linearity to function arrows. Linear functions can receive inputs from linearly-bound values, but can also operate over unrestricted, regular values.   To demonstrate the efficacy of our linear type system - both how easy it can be integrated in an existing language implementation and how streamlined it makes it to write programs with linear types - we implemented our type system in GHC, the leading Haskell compiler, and demonstrate two kinds of applications of linear types: mutable data with pure interfaces; and enforcing protocols in I/O-performing functions.",17,[],7

In this work we propose a method to segment the liver and its lesions from Computed Tomography (CT) scans using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), that have proven good results in a variety of computer vision tasks, including medical imaging. The network that segments the lesions consists of a cascaded architecture, which first focuses on the region of the liver in order to segment the lesions on it. Moreover, we train a detector to localize the lesions, and mask the results of the segmentation network with the positive detections. The segmentation architecture is based on DRIU, a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) with side outputs that work on feature maps of different resolutions, to finally benefit from the multi-scale information learned by different stages of the network. The main contribution of this work is the use of a detector to localize the lesions, which we show to be beneficial to remove false positives triggered by the segmentation network.

1707.01006,cs,"The main result of this paper is a proof that a nearly flat, acutely triangulated convex cap C in R3 has an edge-unfolding to a non-overlapping polygon in the plane. A convex cap is the intersection of the surface of a convex polyhedron and a halfspace. ""Nearly flat"" means that every outer face normal forms a sufficiently small angle phi < Phi with the z-axis orthogonal to the halfspace bounding plane. The size of Phi depends on the acuteness gap alpha: if every triangle angle is at most pi/2-alpha, then Phi ~= 0.36 sqrt(alpha) suffices; e.g., for alpha ~= 3deg, Phi = 5deg. Even if C is closed to a polyhedron by adding the convex polygonal base under C, this polyhedron can be edge-unfolded without overlap. The proof employs the recent concepts of angle-monotone and radially monotone curves.

However, some of the texture are not fully recovered, which was unfamiliar to some radiologists. To cope with this problem, here we propose a direct residual learning approach on directional wavelet domain to solve this problem and to improve the performance against previous work.

The experimental results confirm that the proposed network has significantly improved performance, preserving the detail texture of the original images.",17,[],7
1706.03416,cs,"In order to perform complex actions in human environments, an autonomous robot needs the ability to understand the environment, that is, to gather and maintain spatial knowledge. Topological map is commonly used for representing large scale, global maps such as floor plans. Although much work has been done in topological map extraction, we have found little previous work on the problem of learning the topological map using a probabilistic model. Learning a topological map means learning the structure of the large-scale space and dependency between places, for example, how the evidence of a group of places influence the attributes of other places. This is an important step towards planning complex actions in the environment. In this thesis, we consider the problem of using probabilistic deep learning model to learn the topological map, which is essentially a sparse undirected graph where nodes represent places annotated with their semantic attributes (e.g. place category). We propose to use a novel probabilistic deep model, Sum-Product Networks (SPNs), due to their unique properties. We present two methods for learning topological maps using SPNs: the place grid method and the template-based method. We contribute an algorithm that builds SPNs for graphs using template models. Our experiments evaluate the ability of our models to enable robots to infer semantic attributes and detect maps with novel semantic attribute arrangements.

1704.01085,cs,"Depth from focus (DFF) is one of the classical ill-posed inverse problems in computer vision. Most approaches recover the depth at each pixel based on the focal setting which exhibits maximal sharpness. Yet, it is not obvious how to reliably estimate the sharpness level, particularly in low-textured areas. In this paper, we propose `Deep Depth From Focus (DDFF)' as the first end-to-end learning approach to this problem. One of the main challenges we face is the hunger for data of deep neural networks. In order to obtain a significant amount of focal stacks with corresponding groundtruth depth, we propose to leverage a light-field camera with a co-calibrated RGB-D sensor. This allows us to digitally create focal stacks of varying sizes. Compared to existing benchmarks our dataset is 25 times larger, enabling the use of machine learning for this inverse problem. We compare our results with state-of-the-art DFF methods and we also analyze the effect of several key deep architectural components.

In contrast to traditional, monologic Natural Language Processing resources such as news, highly social dialogue is frequent in social media, making it a challenging context for NLP. This paper tests a bootstrapping method, originally proposed in a monologic domain, to train classifiers to identify two different types of subjective language in dialogue: sarcasm and nastiness. We explore two methods of developing linguistic indicators to be used in a first level classifier aimed at maximizing precision at the expense of recall. The best performing classifier for the first phase achieves 54% precision and 38% recall for sarcastic utterances. We then use general syntactic patterns from previous work to create more general sarcasm indicators, improving precision to 62% and recall to 52%. To further test the generality of the method, we then apply it to bootstrapping a classifier for nastiness dialogic acts. Our first phase, using crowdsourced nasty indicators, achieves 58% precision and 49% recall, which increases to 75% precision and 62% recall when we bootstrap over the first level with generalized syntactic patterns.",17,[],7

For a power grid in the network, the net value derived from providing power to the network must be maximized. For a microgrid, it is desirable to maximize the net gain derived from consuming the received power. Finally, for an independent system operator, stored energy levels at microgrids must be maintained as close as possible to storage capacity to secure network emergency operation. To achieve these objectives, a multiobjective approach is proposed. The price signal generated by the MO and power distributed by the DNO are assigned based on a Pareto optimal solution of a multiobjective optimization problem.

However, this approach (i) tends to yield a number of spurious associations, (ii) does not capture different relevant types of associations, and (iii) is incapable of aggregating knowledge that is spread across documents.

The traditional manual judgment methods are expensive, time-consuming, unrepeatable, and sometimes with low agreement. On the other hand, the popular automatic MT evaluation methods have some weaknesses. Firstly, they tend to perform well on the language pairs with English as the target language, but weak when English is used as source. Secondly, some methods rely on many additional linguistic features to achieve good performance, which makes the metric unable to replicate and apply to other language pairs easily. Thirdly, some popular metrics utilize incomprehensive factors, which result in low performance on some practical tasks. In this thesis, to address the existing problems, we design novel MT evaluation methods and investigate their performances on different languages. Firstly, we design augmented factors to yield highly accurate evaluation.Secondly, we design a tunable evaluation model where weighting of factors can be optimised according to the characteristics of languages.

Being able to program state machines in monoidal computers allows us to represent Turing machines, to capture their execution, count their steps, as well as, e.g., the memory cells that they use.

1708.05655,cs,"In this paper, we propose a new multi-objective contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem with two objectives, where one of the objectives dominates the other objective. Unlike single-objective MAB problems in which the learner obtains a random scalar reward for each arm it selects, in the proposed problem, the learner obtains a random reward vector, where each component of the reward vector corresponds to one of the objectives and the distribution of the reward depends on the context that is provided to the learner at the beginning of each round. We call this problem contextual multi-armed bandit with a dominant objective (CMAB-DO). In CMAB-DO, the goal of the learner is to maximize its total reward in the non-dominant objective while ensuring that it maximizes its total reward in the dominant objective. In this case, the optimal arm given a context is the one that maximizes the expected reward in the non-dominant objective among all arms that maximize the expected reward in the dominant objective. First, we show that the optimal arm lies in the Pareto front. Then, we propose the multi-objective contextual multi-armed bandit algorithm (MOC-MAB), and define two performance measures: the 2-dimensional (2D) regret and the Pareto regret. We show that both the 2D regret and the Pareto regret of MOC-MAB are sublinear in the number of rounds.

1712.01643,cs,"Representation-based classification methods such as sparse representation-based classification (SRC) and linear regression classification (LRC) have attracted a lot of attentions. In order to obtain the better representation, a novel method called projection representation-based classification (PRC) is proposed for image recognition in this paper. PRC is based on a new mathematical model. This model denotes that the 'ideal projection' of a sample point equation on the hyper-space equation may be gained by iteratively computing the projection of equation on a line of hyper-space equation with the proper strategy. Therefore, PRC is able to iteratively approximate the 'ideal representation' of each subject for classification. Moreover, the discriminant PRC (DPRC) is further proposed, which obtains the discriminant information by maximizing the ratio of the between-class reconstruction error over the within-class reconstruction error. Experimental results on five typical databases show that the proposed PRC and DPRC are effective and outperform other state-of-the-art methods on several vision recognition tasks.",17,[],7

In a cyber-physical system, information flows are not only present at the digital level, but also at a physical level, and to and fro the two levels. In this work, we provide a methodology to formally analyse a Cyber-Physical System composite model (combining physics and control) using an information flow-theoretic approach. We use this approach to quantify the level of vulnerability of a system with respect to attackers with different capabilities. We illustrate our approach by means of a water distribution case study.",17,[],7

In order to promote student engagement, we attempt to build a personalized recommender system of research opportunities to undergraduates. With this goal in mind we investigate two tasks. First, one that identifies students that are more willing to participate on this kind of program. A second task is generating a personalized list of recommendations of research opportunities for each student. To evaluate our approach, we perform a simulated prediction experiment with data from our School, which has more than 4,000 active undergraduate students nowadays.

Both the composition of the virtual network functions (VNFs) into a forwarding graph (FG) at the logical layer and the embedding of the FG on the servers need to take into account the less-than-carrier-grade reliability of COTS components. This work investigates the trade-off between end-to-end reliability and computational load per server via the joint design of VNF chain composition (CC) and FG embedding (FGE) under the assumption of a bipartite FG that consists of controller and regular VNFs. Evaluating the reliability criterion within a probabilistic model, analytical insights are first provided for a simplified disconnected FG. Then, a block coordinate descent method based on mixed-integer linear programming is proposed to tackle the joint optimization of CC and FGE. Via simulation results, it is observed that a joint design of CC and FGE leads to substantial performance gains compared to separate optimization approaches.",17,['math'],7

1703.06536,cs,"A selective classifier (f,g) comprises a classification function f and a binary selection function g, which determines if the classifier abstains from prediction, or uses f to predict. The classifier is called pointwise-competitive if it classifies each point identically to the best classifier in hindsight (from the same class), whenever it does not abstain. The quality of such a classifier is quantified by its rejection mass, defined to be the probability mass of the points it rejects. A ""fast"" rejection rate is achieved if the rejection mass is bounded from above by O(1/m) where m is the number of labeled examples used to train the classifier (and O hides logarithmic factors). Pointwise-competitive selective (PCS) classifiers are intimately related to disagreement-based active learning and it is known that in the realizable case, a fast rejection rate of a known PCS algorithm (called Consistent Selective Strategy) is equivalent to an exponential speedup of the well-known CAL active algorithm.   We focus on the agnostic setting, for which there is a known algorithm called LESS that learns a PCS classifier and achieves a fast rejection rate (depending on Hanneke's disagreement coefficient) under strong assumptions. We present an improved PCS learning algorithm called ILESS for which we show a fast rate (depending on Hanneke's disagreement coefficient) without any assumptions. Our rejection bound smoothly interpolates the realizable and agnostic settings. The main result of this paper is an equivalence between the following three entities: (i) the existence of a fast rejection rate for any PCS learning algorithm (such as ILESS); (ii) a poly-logarithmic bound for Hanneke's disagreement coefficient; and (iii) an exponential speedup for a new disagreement-based active learner called ActiveiLESS.",17,[],7
1712.08819,cs,"We present an approach to combining distributional semantic representations induced from text corpora with manually constructed lexical-semantic networks. While both kinds of semantic resources are available with high lexical coverage, our aligned resource combines the domain specificity and availability of contextual information from distributional models with the conciseness and high quality of manually crafted lexical networks. We start with a distributional representation of induced senses of vocabulary terms, which are accompanied with rich context information given by related lexical items. We then automatically disambiguate such representations to obtain a full-fledged proto-conceptualization, i.e. a typed graph of induced word senses. In a final step, this proto-conceptualization is aligned to a lexical ontology, resulting in a hybrid aligned resource. Moreover, unmapped induced senses are associated with a semantic type in order to connect them to the core resource. Manual evaluations against ground-truth judgments for different stages of our method as well as an extrinsic evaluation on a knowledge-based Word Sense Disambiguation benchmark all indicate the high quality of the new hybrid resource.

We formally study LDR matrices in deep learning. First, we prove the universal approximation property of LDR neural networks with a mild condition on the displacement operators.

1708.06334,cs,"Historically, medical imaging repositories have been supported by indoor infrastructures. However, the amount of diagnostic imaging procedures has continuously increased over the last decades, imposing several challenges associated with the storage volume, data redundancy and availability. Cloud platforms are focused on delivering hardware and software services over the Internet, becoming an appealing solution for repository outsourcing. Although this option may bring financial and technological benefits, it also presents new challenges. In medical imaging scenarios, communication latency is a critical issue that still hinders the adoption of this paradigm. This paper proposes an intelligent Cloud storage gateway that optimizes data access times. This is achieved through a new cache architecture that combines static rules and pattern recognition for eviction and prefetching. The evaluation results, obtained through simulations over a real-world dataset, show that cache hit ratios can reach around 80%, leading reductions of image retrieval times by over 60%. The combined use of eviction and prefetching policies pro- posed can significantly reduce communication latency, even when using a small cache in comparison to the total size of the repository. Apart from the performance gains, the proposed system is capable of adjusting to specific workflows of different institutions.",17,[],7

1710.06501,cs,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) currently achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in image classification. With a growing number of classes, the accuracy usually drops as the possibilities of confusion increase. Interestingly, the class confusion patterns follow a hierarchical structure over the classes. We present visual-analytics methods to reveal and analyze this hierarchy of similar classes in relation with CNN-internal data. We found that this hierarchy not only dictates the confusion patterns between the classes, it furthermore dictates the learning behavior of CNNs. In particular, the early layers in these networks develop feature detectors that can separate high-level groups of classes quite well, even after a few training epochs. In contrast, the latter layers require substantially more epochs to develop specialized feature detectors that can separate individual classes. We demonstrate how these insights are key to significant improvement in accuracy by designing hierarchy-aware CNNs that accelerate model convergence and alleviate overfitting. We further demonstrate how our methods help in identifying various quality issues in the training data.",17,[],7
1711.00253,cs,"Landmark/pose estimation in single monocular images have received much effort in computer vision due to its important applications. It remains a challenging task when input images severe occlusions caused by, e.g., adverse camera views. Under such circumstances, biologically implausible pose predictions may be produced. In contrast, human vision is able to predict poses by exploiting geometric constraints of landmark point inter-connectivity. To address the problem, by incorporating priors about the structure of pose components, we propose a novel structure-aware fully convolutional network to implicitly take such priors into account during training of the deep network. Explicit learning of such constraints is typically challenging. Instead, inspired by how human identifies implausible poses, we design discriminators to distinguish the real poses from the fake ones (such as biologically implausible ones). If the pose generator G generates results that the discriminator fails to distinguish from real ones, the network successfully learns the priors. Training of the network follows the strategy of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The effectiveness of the proposed network is evaluated on three pose-related tasks: 2D single human pose estimation, 2D facial landmark estimation and 3D single human pose estimation. The proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and almost always generates plausible pose predictions, demonstrating the usefulness of implicit learning of structures using GANs.",17,[],7

Moreover we introduce several strategies trained with evolutionary algorithms to excel at the Moran process. These strategies are excellent invaders and resistors of invasion and in some cases naturally evolve handshaking mechanisms to resist invasion. The best invaders were those trained to maximize total payoff while the best resistors invoke handshake mechanisms. This suggests that while maximizing individual payoff can lead to the evolution of cooperation through invasion, the relatively weak invasion resistance of payoff maximizing strategies are not as evolutionarily stable as strategies employing handshake mechanisms.",17,['physics'],7

1711.06500,cs,"An intrinsic challenge of person re-identification (re-ID) is the annotation difficulty. This typically means 1) few training samples per identity, and 2) thus the lack of diversity among the training samples. Consequently, we face high risk of over-fitting when training the convolutional neural network (CNN), a state-of-the-art method in person re-ID. To reduce the risk of over-fitting, this paper proposes a Pseudo Positive Regularization (PPR) method to enrich the diversity of the training data. Specifically, unlabeled data from an independent pedestrian database is retrieved using the target training data as query. A small proportion of these retrieved samples are randomly selected as the Pseudo Positive samples and added to the target training set for the supervised CNN training. The addition of Pseudo Positive samples is therefore a data augmentation method to reduce the risk of over-fitting during CNN training. We implement our idea in the identification CNN models (i.e., CaffeNet, VGGNet-16 and ResNet-50). On CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently improves the baseline and yields competitive performance to the state-of-the-art person re-ID methods.",17,[],7

1710.01391,cs,"In this paper, we study the resource allocation algorithm design for multiple-input single-output (MISO) multicarrier non-orthogonal multiple access (MC-NOMA) systems, in which a full-duplex base station serves multiple half-duplex uplink and downlink users on the same subcarrier simultaneously. The resource allocation is optimized for maximization of the weighted system throughput while the information leakage is constrained and artificial noise is injected to guarantee secure communication in the presence of multiple potential eavesdroppers. To this end, we formulate a robust non-convex optimization problem taking into account the imperfect channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropping channels and the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of the legitimate users. Despite the non-convexity of the optimization problem, we solve it optimally by applying monotonic optimization which yields the optimal beamforming, artificial noise design, subcarrier allocation, and power allocation policy. The optimal resource allocation policy serves as a performance benchmark since the corresponding monotonic optimization based algorithm entails a high computational complexity. Hence, we also develop a low-complexity suboptimal resource allocation algorithm which converges to a locally optimal solution. Our simulation results reveal that the performance of the suboptimal algorithm closely approaches that of the optimal algorithm. Besides, the proposed optimal MISO NOMA system can not only ensure downlink and uplink communication security simultaneously but also provides a significant system secrecy rate improvement compared to traditional MISO orthogonal multiple access (OMA) systems and two other baseline schemes.",17,['math'],7

For a fixed, externally given root processor equation, there is an additive penalty of at most equation time steps where each equation is the total amount of data in a tree of equation different processors with roots equation as constructed by the algorithm. The worst-case penalty is less than equation time steps. The algorithms have attractive properties for implementing the operations for MPI (the Message-Passing Interface). Standard algorithms using fixed trees take time either equation in the worst case, or equation.

1702.00535,cs,"Private record linkage (PRL) is the problem of identifying pairs of records that are similar as per an input matching rule from databases held by two parties that do not trust one another. We identify three key desiderata that a PRL solution must ensure: 1) perfect precision and high recall of matching pairs, 2) a proof of end-to-end privacy, and 3) communication and computational costs that scale subquadratically in the number of input records. We show that all of the existing solutions for PRL - including secure 2-party computation (S2PC), and their variants that use non-private or differentially private (DP) blocking to ensure subquadratic cost - violate at least one of the three desiderata. In particular, S2PC techniques guarantee end-to-end privacy but have either low recall or quadratic cost. In contrast, no end-to-end privacy guarantee has been formalized for solutions that achieve subquadratic cost. This is true even for solutions that compose DP and S2PC: DP does not permit the release of any exact information about the databases, while S2PC algorithms for PRL allow the release of matching records.   In light of this deficiency, we propose a novel privacy model, called output constrained differential privacy, that shares the strong privacy protection of DP, but allows for the truthful release of the output of a certain function applied to the data. We apply this to PRL, and show that protocols satisfying this privacy model permit the disclosure of the true matching records, but their execution is insensitive to the presence or absence of a single non-matching record. We find that prior work that combine DP and S2PC techniques even fail to satisfy this end-to-end privacy model. Hence, we develop novel protocols that provably achieve this end-to-end privacy guarantee, together with the other two desiderata of PRL.",17,[],7

Removing false positives can therefore significantly lower the false positive rate. The ACF, like the cuckoo filter, uses a cuckoo hash table to store fingerprints. We allow fingerprint entries to be changed in response to a false positive in a manner designed to minimize the effect on the performance of the filter.

1710.00848,gr-qc,"General Relativity predicts the existence of black-holes. Access to the complete space-time manifold is required to describe the black-hole. This feature necessitates that black-hole dynamics is specified by future or teleological boundary condition. Here we demonstrate that the statistical mechanical description of black-holes, the raison d'etre behind the existence of black-hole thermodynamics, requires teleological boundary condition. Within the fluid-gravity paradigm --- Einstein's equations when projected on space-time horizons resemble Navier-Stokes equation of a fluid --- we show that the specific heat and the coefficient of bulk viscosity of the horizon-fluid are negative only if the teleological boundary condition is taken into account.

Such black holes possess an apparent horizon, however the event horizon may be absent. In such a case, the information from the black hole interior may reach the external observer after the complete evaporation of the black hole. This model might be used for the resolution of the information loss puzzle. However, as we demonstrate, in a general case the quantum radiation emitted from the black hole interior, calculated in the given black hole background, is very large. This outburst of the radiation is exponentially large for models with the redshift function equation. We show that it can be suppressed by including a non-trivial redshift function. However, even this suppression is not enough to guarantee self-consistency of the model. This problem is a manifestation of a general problem, known as the ""mass inflation"".

In the current framework the retention time is associated with the time scale for a local perturbation to become effectively undetectable (scrambling time). Also, we provide a scenario for storing the information about an infalling matter in the near-horizon region in a layered fashion.

As a result over the past two decades there has been a huge theoretical and observational effort into improving our understanding of the Universe. The cosmological equations describing the dynamics of a homogeneous and isotropic Universe are systems of ordinary differential equations, and one of the most elegant ways these can be investigated is by casting them into the form of dynamical systems. This allows the use of powerful analytical and numerical methods to gain a quantitative understanding of the cosmological dynamics derived by the models under study. In this review we apply these techniques to cosmology. We begin with a brief introduction to dynamical systems, fixed points, linear stability theory, Lyapunov stability, centre manifold theory and more advanced topics relating to the global structure of the solutions. Using this machinery we then analyse a large number of cosmological models and show how the stability conditions allow them to be tightly constrained and even ruled out on purely theoretical grounds. We are also able to identify those models which deserve further in depth investigation through comparison with observational data. This review is a comprehensive and detailed study of dynamical systems applications to cosmological models focusing on the late-time behaviour of our Universe, and in particular on its accelerated expansion.

Here we extend this study to include an analysis of the gravitational waves radiated during the coalescence of such a binary, which is crucial to distinguish these events from other binaries with LIGO and Virgo observations. Our studies reveal that the remnant's gravitational wave signature is mainly governed by its fundamental frequency as it settles down to a non-rotating boson star, emitting significant gravitational radiation during this post-merger state.

The classical solution thus found contains a time dependent electric and a constant magnetic charge. The solution is also reachable from the corresponding mini-superspace action, which is strikingly similar to the Reissner-Nordstrom one. This points to a connection between the black hole geometry and the cosmological solution here found, which is the analog of the known correlation between the Schwarzschild and the Kantowski-Sachs metrics. The configuration space is drastically modified by the presence of the magnetic charge from a 3D flat to a 3D pp wave geometry.

We show that there is actually much more which cannot be so measured; relatively little of a spacetime's geometry is in fact imprinted in any particular electromagnetic field. This is demonstrated by finding a much larger class of metric transformations---involving five free functions---which preserve Maxwell solutions both in vacuum, without local currents, and also for the force-free electrodynamics associated with a tenuous plasma. One consequence of this is that many of the exact force-free fields which have previously been found around Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes are also solutions in appropriately-identified flat backgrounds.

We find that, in order to characterize statistically translationally invariant standing waves, it is essential to consider the correlator equation in addition to the better known equation (where equation are the complex amplitudes of travelling waves). We then examine how the standard process of ""squeezing"" (responsible for converting travelling waves into standing waves while the fluctuations are outside the horizon) reacts to being fed primordial standing waves. For translationally invariant systems only one type of standing wave, with the correct temporal phase (the ""sine wave""), survives squeezing. Primordial standing waves might therefore be invisible at late times -- or not -- depending on their phase. Theories with modified dispersion relations behave differently in this respect, since only standing waves with the opposite temporal phase survive at late times.",17,[],13

The attention is focused on qualitative aspects of long-term postmerger evolution. As simplified test models, we use a moderately stiff Gamma=2 ideal-fluid equation of state and unmagnetized irrotational equal-mass binaries with three masses well below the threshold for prompt collapse. Our high resolution simulations generate postmerger ""ringdown"" gravitational wave (GW) signals of 170 ms, sustained by rotating massive NS remnants without collapsing to black holes. We observe that the high-density double-core structure inside the remnants gradually turns into a quasi-axisymmetric toroidal shape. It oscillates in a quasi-periodic manner and shrinks in size due to gravitational radiation. In the GW spectrograms, dominant double peaks persist throughout the postmerger simulations and slowly drift to higher frequencies. A new low-frequency peak emerges at about 100 ms after merger, owing to the growth of GW-driven unstable oscillation modes. The long-term effect of grid resolution is also investigated using the same initial model.

In analytical calculations the dark matter sector was modeled by an addition of a U (1)-gauge field coupled to the visible sector. The backreaction analysis revealed that the impact of the dark vortex presence is far more complicated than causing only a deficit angle. The vortex causes an ergosphere shift and the event horizon velocity is also influenced by its presence. These phenomena are more significant than in the case of a visible vortex sector. The area of the event horizon of a black hole is diminished and this decline is larger in comparison to the Kerr black hole with an Abelian Higgs vortex case. After analyzing the gravitational properties for the general setup, we focused on the subset of models that are motivated by particle physics. We retained the Abelian Higgs model as a description of the dark matter sector (this sector contained a heavy dark photon and an additional complex scalar) and added a real scalar representing the real component of the Higgs doublet in the unitary gauge, as well as an additional U (1)-gauge field representing an ordinary electromagnetic field. Moreover, we considered two coupling channels between the visible and dark sectors, which were the kinetic mixing between the gauge fields and a quartic coupling between the scalar fields. After solving the equations of motion for the matter fields numerically we analyzed properties of the cosmic string in the dark matter sector and its influence on the visible sector fields that are directly coupled to it.

These are particular results that follow from the new perspective on FLRW embedding that we develop in this paper, namely that these embeddings are equivalent to unit-speed parametrized curves in two or three dimensions. A careful analysis of appropriate tensor fields then gives identical results and further explains why the class-two geometries remained hidden. However, the signatures of the embedding spaces, as well as the explicit embedding formulae, follow only from the curve picture. This also streamlines the comparatively difficult equation class and provides new explicit embedding formulae for it and reproduces known embedding formulae for the equation classes.

This defines two distinct frequencies that vary on the radiation-reaction timescale: the nutation frequency equation and the precession frequency equation. We use analytic solutions for generic spin precession at 2PN order to derive Fourier series for the total and orbital angular momenta in which each term is a sinusoid with frequency equation for integer equation. As black holes inspiral, they can pass through nutational resonances (equation) at which the total angular momentum tilts.

Quantum excitations of the dilaton phase induced a slightly red-tilted spectrum of gaussian and adiabatic scalar perturbations, but no analogous primordial gravitational waves were generated. Subsequent cosmological epochs through nucleosynthesis are as in standard cosmology.

We compute explicitly these two notions of entanglement between neighboring nodes and show that they are always related to the typical equation term depending on the spin equation living on the link between them. This equation contribution comes from looking at non-gauge invariant states, thus we interpret it as gauge-breaking and unphysical. In particular, this confirms that pure spin network basis states do not carry any physical entanglement, so that true entanglement and correlations in loop quantum gravity comes from spin or intertwiner superpositions.",17,[],13

In this paper, we adopt the effective-one-body formalism as the equation of motion, and obtain the accurately calculated gravitational waveforms by solving the Teukolsky equation in frequency-domain. We point out that high frequency modes of gravitational waves can be excited by large eccentricities of intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals. These high frequency modes can extend to more than 10 Hz, and enter the designed sensitive band of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo.

Probing these gravitational emissions requires the gravitational-wave detectors to have high sensitivity above 1 kHz. Fortunately for current advanced detectors, there is a sizeable gap between the quantum-limited sensitivity and the classical noise at high frequencies. Here we propose a detector design that closes such a gap by reducing the high-frequency quantum noise with an active optomechanical filter, frequency-dependent squeezing, and high optical power. The resulting noise level from 1 kHz to 4 kHz approaches the current facility limit and is a factor of 20 to 30 below the design of existing advanced detectors. This will allow for precision measurements of (i) the post-merger signal of the binary neutron star, (ii) late-time inspiral, merger, and ringdown of low-mass black hole-neutron star systems, and possible detection of (iii) high-frequency modes during supernovae explosions. This design tries to maximize the science return of current facilities by achieving a sensitive frequency band that is complementary to the longer-baseline third-generation detectors: the10 km Einstein Telescope, and 40 km Cosmic Explorer. We have highlighted the main technical challenges towards realizing the design, which requires dedicated research programs.

In previous work, we have studied the dynamics of spherical test scalar fields on such a background. In particular, we proved that such fields cannot develop any divergences which propagate along the Cauchy horizon. In the present work, we extend our analysis to the more general case of test fields without symmetries and to linearized gravitational perturbations with odd parity. To this purpose, we first consider test fields possessing a divergence-free stress-energy tensor satisfying the dominant energy condition, and we prove that a suitable energy norm is uniformly bounded in the domain of dependence of the initial slice. In particular, this result implies that free-falling observers co-moving with the dust particles measure a finite energy of the field, even as they cross the Cauchy horizon at points lying arbitrarily close to the central singularity. Next, for the case of Klein-Gordon fields, we derive point-wise bounds from our energy estimates which imply that the scalar field cannot diverge at the Cauchy horizon, except possibly at the central singular point. Finally, we analyze the behaviour of odd-parity, linear gravitational and dust perturbations of the collapsing spacetime. Similarly to the scalar field case, we prove that the relevant gauge-invariant combinations of the metric perturbations stay bounded away from the central singularity, implying that no divergences can propagate in the vacuum region.

We show that for linearized perturbations, the integrated version of the physical process law, which determines the change of entropy between two asymptotic cross-sections, is independent of these ambiguities. In case of entropy change between two intermediate cross sections of the horizon, we show that it inherits additional contributions, which coincide with the membrane energy associated with the horizon fluid.

Several theoretical approaches to the current as well as future gravitational wave signals interpretation are discussed together with a strategy for a search for corresponding transients by means of multimessenger astronomy.   One of the aims of this thesis is to develop a new method for GW source localization depending on a polarization state of an incoming GW in the case of a detection by two interferometric antennas.

Here we theoretically predict that, because of the equivalence between an inhomogeneous dielectric medium and a gravitational field demonstrated in transformation optics, a significant SOI is induced onto circularly polarized light passing by the gravitational lens of a black hole. This leads to: i) the photons to propagate along chiral trajectories if the size of the blackhole is smaller than the wavelength of the incident photons, ii) the resulting image of the gravitational lens to manifest an azimuthal rotation because of these chiral trajectories.

Measurements of the per-jet tagging efficiency are presented using a data set of 3.2 equation of proton--proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector. The fraction of pile-up jets rejected in the range equation is estimated in simulated events with an average of 22 interactions per bunch-crossing. It increases with jet transverse momentum and, for jets with transverse momentum between 20 and 50 GeV, it ranges between 49% and 67% with an efficiency of 85% for selecting hard-scatter jets. A case study is performed in Higgs boson production via the vector-boson fusion process, showing that these techniques mitigate the background growth due to additional proton--proton interactions, thus enhancing the reach for such signatures.",17,[],12

Such measurements could be performed at a future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) with suitable forward detectors. The measured proton recoil momentum (~< 100 MeV in the deuteron rest frame) specifies the deuteron configuration during the high-energy process and permits a controlled theoretical treatment of nuclear effects. Nuclear and nucleonic structure are separated using methods of light-front quantum mechanics. The impulse approximation (IA) to the tagged DIS cross section contains the free neutron pole, which can be reached by on-shell extrapolation in the recoil momentum. Final-state interactions (FSI) distort the recoil momentum distribution away from the pole. In the intermediate-x region 0.1 < x < 0.5 FSI arise predominantly from interactions of the spectator proton with slow hadrons produced in the DIS process on the neutron (rest frame momenta ~< 1 GeV, target fragmentation region).

For XENON10, in addition to including electron-recoil data corresponding to about equation electrons, we include for the first time events with equation electrons. Assuming the scattering is momentum independent, this strengthens a previous cross-section bound by almost an order of magnitude for dark matter masses above 50 MeV. The available XENON100 data corresponds to events with equation electrons, and leads to a constraint that is comparable to the XENON10 bound above 50 MeV. We demonstrate that a search for an annual modulation signal in upcoming xenon experiments (XENON1T, XENONnT, LZ) could substantially improve the above bounds even in the presence of large backgrounds. We also emphasize that in simple benchmark models of sub-GeV dark matter, the dark matter-electron scattering rate can be as high as one event every ten (two) seconds in the XENON1T (XENONnT or LZ) experiments, without being in conflict with any other known experimental bounds. While there are several sources of backgrounds that can produce single- or few-electron events, a large event rate can be consistent with a dark matter signal and should not be simply written off as purely a detector curiosity.

1712.06555,hep-ph,"We propose a complex extension of equation permutation antisymmetry in the neutrino Majorana matrix equation. The latter can be realized for the Lagrangian by appropriate CP transformations on the neutrino fields. The resultant form of equation is shown to be simply related to that with a complex (CP) extension of equation permutation symmetry, with identical phenomenological consequences, though their group theoretic origins are quite different. We investigate those consequences in detail for the minimal seesaw induced by two strongly hierarchical right-chiral neutrinos equation and equation with the result that the Dirac phase is maximal while the two Majorana phases are either 0 or equation. We further provide an uptodate discussion of the equation process vis-a-vis ongoing and forthcoming experiments. Finally, a thorough treatment is given of baryogenesis via leptogenesis in this scenario, primarily with the assumption that the lepton asymmetry produced by the decays of equation only matters here with the asymmetry produced by equation being washed out. Tight upper and lower bounds on the mass of equation are obtained from the constraint of obtaining the correct observed range of the baryon asymmetry parameter and the role played by equation is elucidated thereafter. The mildly hierarchical right-chiral neutrino case (including the quasidegenerate possibility) is discussed in an Appendix.",17,[],2
1710.10527,hep-ph,"Models based on equation symmetry breaking and large equation limit provide relations between the pion cloud contributions to the equation quadrupole form factors, electric (equation) and Coulomb (equation), and the neutron electric form factor equation, suggesting that those form factors are dominated by the same physical processes. Those relations are improved in order to satisfy a fundamental constraint between the electric and Coulomb quadrupole form factors in the long wavelength limit, when the photon three-momentum vanishes (Siegert's theorem). Inspired by those relations, we study alternative parametrizations for the neutron electric form factor. The parameters of the new form are then determined by a combined fit to the equation and the equation quadrupole form factor data. We obtain a very good description of the equation and equation data when we combine the pion cloud contributions with small valence quark contributions to the equation quadrupole form factors. The best description of the data is obtained when the second momentum of equation is equation fmequation. We conclude that the square radii associated with equation and equation, equation and equation, respectively, are large, revealing the long extension of the pion cloud. We conclude also that those square radii are related by equation fmequation.

1706.05605,hep-ph,"In the light of recent possible tensions in the Hubble constant equation and the structure growth rate equation between the Planck and other measurements, we investigate a hidden-charged dark matter (DM) model where DM interacts with hidden chiral fermions, which are charged under the hidden SU(N) and U(1) gauge interactions. The symmetries in this model assure these fermions to be massless. The DM in this model, which is a Dirac fermion and singlet under the hidden SU(N), is also assumed to be charged under the U(1) gauge symmetry, through which it can interact with the chiral fermions. Below the confinement scale of SU(N), the hidden quark condensate spontaneously breaks the U(1) gauge symmetry such that there remains a discrete symmetry, which accounts for the stability of DM. This condensate also breaks a flavor symmetry in this model and Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with this flavor symmetry appear below the confinement scale. The hidden U(1) gauge boson and hidden quarks/Nambu-Goldstone bosons are components of dark radiation (DR) above/below the confinement scale. These light fields increase the effective number of neutrinos by equation above the confinement scale for equation, resolving the tension in the measurements of the Hubble constant by Planck and Hubble Space Telescope if the confinement scale is equation eV. DM and DR continuously scatter with each other via the hidden U(1) gauge interaction, which suppresses the matter power spectrum and results in a smaller structure growth rate. The DM sector couples to the Standard Model sector through the exchange of a real singlet scalar mixing with the Higgs boson, which makes it possible to probe our model in DM direct detection experiments. Variants of this model are also discussed, which may offer alternative ways to investigate this scenario.",17,['astro-ph'],2

Limited only by statistical error, in an optimistic scenario, we find that our approach leads to good precision at high integrated luminosity, at a few hundred MeV assuming 300-3000 fbequation at the LHC. The approach directly probes the total width, in such a way that model-dependence can be minimized.

It is demonstrated that the PT observables, the degree of polarization and the polarization components of outgoing fermions, are sensitive on assumptions about the nonresonant background model. In particular it is shown that the normal components of the polarization of the outgoing nucleon and the lepton are determined by the interference between the resonant (RES) and nonresonant (NB) amplitudes.

Two correlators, i.e. the usual one and the right-handed one, are adopted in the LCSR calculation. The resultant LCSRs for the equation TFFs are arranged according to the twist structure of the equation-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs), whose twist-2, twist-3 and twist-4 terms behave quite differently by using different correlators. We observe that the twist-4 LCDAs, though generally small, shall have sizable contributions to the TFFs equation, equation and equation, thus the twist-4 terms should be kept for a sound prediction. We also observe that even though different choices of the correlator lead to different LCSRs with different twist contributions, the large correlation coefficients for most of the TFFs indicate that the LCSRs for different correlators are close to each order, not only for their values at the large recoil point equation but also for their ascending trends in whole equation-region. Such a high degree of correlation is confirmed by their application to the branching fraction of the semi-leptonic decay equation. Thus, a proper choice of correlator may inversely provide a chance for probing uncertain LCDAs, i.e. the contributions from those LCDAs can be amplified to a certain degree via a proper choice of correlator, thus amplifying the sensitivity of the TFFs, and hence their related observables, to those LCDAs.",17,[],2

Furthermore, there is the long-standing discrepancy between the measurement and the theory prediction of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon (equation) at the equation level. Concerning NP effects, equation data can be naturally explained with a new neutral gauge bosons, i.e. a equation but also with heavy new scalars and fermions contributing via box diagrams. Another promising solution to equation, which can also explain equation, are leptoquarks. Interestingly, leptoquarks provide also a viable explanation of equation which can be tested via correlated effects in equation at future colliders.

In the last decade, however, in an explosion of data from both equation and hadron colliders, there are many recently observed states that do not fit into this picture. These new particles are called generically ""exotics"". They can be either mesons or baryons. Remarkably, they all decay into at least one meson formed of either a equation or equation pair. In this review, after the introduction, we explore each of these new discoveries in detail first from an experimental point of view, then subsequently give a theoretical discussion. These exotics can be explained if the new mesons contain two-quarks and two-antiquarks (tetraquarks), while the baryons contain four-quarks plus an antiquark (pentquarks). The theoretical explanations for these states take three divergent tracks: tightly bound objects, just as in the case of normal hadrons, but with more constituents, or loosely bound ""molecules"" similar to the deuteron, but formed from two mesons, or a meson or baryon, or more wistfully, they are not multiquark states but appear due to kinematic effects caused by different rescatterings of virtual particles; most of these models have all been post-dictions.

The vacuum is naturally aligned to ensure equation at low energies, and the masses of these axions can be much larger than for the standard QCD axion. This mechanism avoids the introduction of a discrete equation symmetry and associated 'mirror' copies of the SM fermions, and also avoids the introduction and stabilization of new light colored states to modify the running of the QCD gauge coupling found in other heavy axion models.

1707.07943,hep-ph,"In models of inflation driven by an axion-like pseudoscalar field, the inflaton, a, may couple to the standard model hypercharge via a Chern-Simons-type interaction, equation. This coupling results in explosive gauge field production during inflation, especially at its last stage, which has interesting phenomenological consequences: For one thing, the primordial hypermagnetic field is maximally helical. It is thus capable of sourcing the generation of nonzero baryon number, via the standard model chiral anomaly, around the time of electroweak symmetry breaking. For another thing, the gauge field production during inflation feeds back into the primordial tensor power spectrum, leaving an imprint in the stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper, we focus on the correlation between these two phenomena. Working in the approximation of instant reheating, we (1) update the investigation of baryogenesis via hypermagnetic fields from pseudoscalar inflation and (2) examine the corresponding implications for the GW spectrum. We find that successful baryogenesis requires a suppression scale Lambda of around Lambda ~ 3 x 1017 GeV, which corresponds to a relatively weakly coupled axion. The gauge field production at the end of inflation is then typically accompanied by a peak in the GW spectrum at frequencies in the MHz range or above. The detection of such a peak is out of reach of present-day technology; but in the future, it may serve as a smoking-gun signal for baryogenesis from pseudoscalar inflation. Conversely, models that do yield an observable GW signal suffer from the overproduction of baryon number, unless the reheating temperature is lower than the electroweak scale.",17,"['astro-ph', 'hep-th']",2

1708.07907,hep-th,"In this work we systematically enumerate genus one fibrations in the class of 7,890 Calabi-Yau manifolds defined as complete intersections in products of projective spaces, the so-called CICY threefolds.

We also study K3-fibrations and nested fibration structures. That is, K3 fibrations with potentially many distinct elliptic fibrations. To accomplish this survey a number of new geometric tools are developed including a determination of the full topology of all CICY threefolds, including triple intersection numbers. In 2,946 cases this involves finding a new ""favorable"" description of the manifold in which all divisors descend from a simple ambient space. Our results consist of a survey of obvious fibrations for all CICY threefolds and a complete classification of all genus one fibrations for 4,957 ""Kahler favorable"" CICYs whose Kahler cones descend from a simple ambient space. Within the CICY dataset, we find 139,597 obvious genus one fibrations, 30,974 obvious K3 fibrations and 208,987 nested combinations. For the Kahler favorable geometries we find a complete classification of 377,559 genus one fibrations. For one manifold with Hodge numbers (19,19) we find an explicit description of an infinite number of distinct genus-one fibrations extending previous results for this particular geometry that have appeared in the literature.

1702.07773,hep-th,"We examine the precise connection between the exact renormalisation group with local couplings and the renormalisation of correlation functions of composite operators in scale-invariant theories. A geometric description of theory space allows us to select convenient non-linear parametrisations that serve different purposes. First, we identify normal parameters in which the renormalisation group flows take their simplest form; normal correlators are defined by functional differentiation with respect to these parameters. The renormalised correlation functions are given by the continuum limit of correlators associated to a cutoff-dependent parametrisation, which can be related to the renormalisation group flows. The necessary linear and non-linear counterterms in any arbitrary parametrisation arise in a natural way from a change of coordinates. We show that, in a class of minimal subtraction schemes, the renormalised correlators are exactly equal to normal correlators evaluated at a finite cutoff. To illustrate the formalism and the main results, we compare standard diagrammatic calculations in a scalar free-field theory with the structure of the perturbative solutions to the Polchinski equation close to the Gaussian fixed point.",17,['hep-ph'],4

These droplets are similar to phase space distributions of a unitary matrix quantum mechanics (UMQM) (equation dimensional) on constant time slices. We find that for a given UMM, it is possible to construct an effective UMQM such that its phase space distributions match with droplets of UMM on different time slices at large equation. Therefore, large equation phase transitions in UMM can be understood in terms of dynamics of an effective UMQM. From the geometry of droplets it is also possible to construct Young diagrams corresponding to equation representations and hence different large equation states of the theory in momentum space. We explicitly consider two examples : single plaquette model with equation terms and Chern-Simons theory on equation.

The main decay mechanism is that of a string splitting into two strings. The corresponding total decay width behaves as equation where equation and equation are the tension and length of the string and equation is a dimensionless universal constant. We show that this result holds for a bosonic string not only in the critical dimension. The partial width of a given decay mode is given by equation where equation is a phase space factor, equation is the mass of the ""quark"" and ""antiquark"" created at the splitting point, and equation is a dimensionless coefficient close to unity. Based on the spectra of hadrons we observe that their (modified) Regge trajectories are characterized by a negative intercept. This implies a repulsive Casimir force that gives the string a ""zero point length"". We fit the theoretical decay width to experimental data for mesons on the trajectories of equation, equation, equation, equation, equation, equation, equation, and equation, and of the baryons equation, equation, equation, and equation. We examine both the linearity in equation and the exponential suppression factor. The linearity was found to agree with the data well for mesons but less for baryons. The extracted coefficient for mesons equation is indeed quite universal. The exponential suppression was applied to both strong and radiative decays. We discuss the relation with string fragmentation and jet formation. We extract the quark-diquark structure of baryons from their decays.

Knowledge of the high frequency response allows us then to derive non-perturbative sum rules. We show, via explicit computations, how holography recovers the general results of CFT, and the associated sum rules, for any holographic field theory with a conformal UV completion -- regardless of any possible new ordering and/or scaling physics in the IR.

Rather, the uplift flattens out due to stronger backreaction on the volume modulus than has previously been anticipated, resulting in vacua which are meta-stable and SUSY breaking, but that are always AdS. However, we also show that setups such as racetrack stabilization can avoid this issue. In these models it is possible to obtain supersymmetric AdS vacua with a cosmological constant that can be tuned to zero while retaining finite moduli stabilization.

Though this effect is of higher order in the gravitational constant than the quadrupole radiation from the collapsing DWs, its amplitude is enhanced in the case of relativistic particles or photons because of absence of the velocity factor which is present in the quadrupole formula. We derive the spectral-angular distribution of PGR within the simplified model of the weakly gravitating particle-wall system in Minkowski space-time of arbitrary dimensions. Within this model the radiation amplitude is obtained analytically. The spectral-angular distribution of PGR in such an approach suffers from infrared and ultraviolet divergences as well as from collinear divergence in the case of a massless perforating particle.

While we cannot naturally associate a density matrix with a state in this setting, it is still possible to define a modular operator for a state, and distinguish between two states using a relative modular operator.

In a significant portion of the unstable subspace, two very different endpoints are reached depending upon the sign of the perturbation. Collapse into a black hole occurs for one sign. For the opposite sign instead one attains a regular solution with periodic modulation. We also construct quenches where the driving frequency and amplitude are continuously varied. Quasistatic quenches can interpolate between pure AdS and sourced solutions with time periodic vev. By suitably choosing the quasistatic path one can obtain boson stars dual to Floquet condensates at zero driving field. We characterize the adiabaticity of the quenching processes.

We introduce lowest possible order discretizations of the split 1D wave equations, in which the discrete momentum and continuity equations follow by trivial projections onto piecewise constant FE spaces, omitting partial integrations. Approximating the Hodge-star by nontrivial Galerkin projections (GP), the two discrete metric equations follow by projections onto either the piecewise constant (GP0) or piecewise linear (GP1) space.   Our framework gives us three schemes with significantly different behavior. The split scheme using twice GP1 is unstable and shares the dispersion relation with the P1-P1 FE scheme that approximates both variables by piecewise linear spaces (P1).

1701.04886,math,"The purpose of this note is to point out that simplicial methods and the well-known Dold-Kan construction in simplicial homotopy theory can be fruitfully applied to convert link homology theories into homotopy theories. Dold and Kan prove that there is a functor from the category of chain complexes over a commutative ring with unit to the category of simplicial objects over that ring such that chain homotopic maps go to homotopic maps in the simplicial category. Furthermore, this is an equivalence of categories. In this way, given a link homology theory, we construct a mapping taking link diagrams to a category of simplicial objects such that up to looping or delooping, link diagrams related by Reidemeister moves will give rise to homotopy equivalent simplicial objects, and the homotopy groups of these objects will be equal to the link homology groups of the original link homology theory. The construction is independent of the particular link homology theory. A simplifying point in producing a homotopy simplicial object in relation to a chain complex occurs when the chain complex is itself derived (via face maps) from a simplicial object that satisfies the Kan extension condition. Under these circumstances one can use that simplicial object rather than apply the Dold-Kan functor to the chain complex. We will give examples of this situation in regard to Khovanov homology. We will investigate detailed working out of this correspondence in separate papers. The purpose of this note is to announce the basic relationships for using simplicial methods in this domain.

For a third order tensor, we define its transpose, kernel tensor and L-eigenvalues. Here, ""L"" is named after Levi-Civita. The transpose of a third order tensor is uniquely defined. In particular, the transpose of the piezoelectric tensor is the inverse piezoelectric tensor (the electrostriction tensor). The kernel tensor of a third order tensor is a second order positive semi-definite symmetric tensor, which is the product of that third order tensor and its transpose. We define L-eigenvalues, singular values, C-eigenvalues and Z-eigenvalues for a third order tensor. They are all invariants of that third order tensor. For a third order partially symmetric tensor, we give its eigenvector decomposition. The piezoelectric tensor, the inverse piezoelectric tensor, and third order symmetric tensors are third order partially symmetric tensors. We make a conjecture a third order symmetric tensor has seven independent invariants. We raise the questions on how may independent invariants a third order tensor, a third order partially symmetric tensor and a third order cyclically symmetric tensor may have respectively.",17,['math'],3

This provides an algebraic formulation of the conservation of locality while renormalising.

1708.00074,math-ph,"We present new connections among anomalous diffusion (AD), normal diffusion (ND) and the Central Limit Theorem. This is done by defining a point transformation to a new position variable, which we postulate to be Cartesian, motivated by considerations from super-symmetric quantum mechanics. Canonically quantizing in the new position and momentum variables according to Dirac gives rise to generalized negative semi-definite and self-adjoint Laplacian operators. These lead to new generalized Fourier transformations and associated probability distributions, which are form invariant under the corresponding transform. The new Laplacians also lead us to generalized diffusion equations, which imply a connection to the CLT. We show that the derived diffusion equations capture all of the Fractal and Non-Fractal Diffusion equations of O'Shaughnessy and Procaccia. However, we also obtain new equations that cannot (so far as we are able to tell) be expressed as examples of the O'Shaughnessy and Procaccia equations. These equations also possess asymptotics that are related to a CLT but with bi-modal distributions as limits. The results show, in part, that experimentally measuring the diffusion scaling law can determine the point transformation (for monomial point transformations). We also show that AD in the original, physical position is actually ND when viewed in terms of displacements in an appropriately transformed position variable.

We argue how the Jones index equation can be used to give a quantitative answer to this, showing how the rich theory of subfactors can be used in a quantum information context. As an example we discuss how the Jones index can be used in the context of wiretap channels.   Subfactors also occur naturally in physics. Here we discuss two examples: rational conformal field theories and Kitaev's toric code on the plane, a prototypical example of a topologically ordered model. There we can directly relate aspects of the general setting to physical properties such as the quantum dimension of the excitations.

1709.06174,math-ph,"We present a construction of a 2-Hilbert space of sections of a bundle gerbe, a suitable candidate for a prequantum 2-Hilbert space in higher geometric quantisation. We introduce a direct sum on the morphism categories in the 2-category of bundle gerbes and show that these categories are cartesian monoidal and abelian. Endomorphisms of the trivial bundle gerbe, or higher functions, carry the structure of a rig-category, which acts on generic morphism categories of bundle gerbes. We continue by presenting a categorification of the hermitean metric on a hermitean line bundle. This is achieved by introducing a functorial dual that extends the dual of vector bundles to morphisms of bundle gerbes, and constructing a two-variable adjunction for the aforementioned rig-module category structure on morphism categories. Its right internal hom is the module action, composed by taking the dual of higher functions, while the left internal hom is interpreted as a bundle gerbe metric. Sections of bundle gerbes are defined as morphisms from the trivial bundle gerbe to a given bundle gerbe. The resulting categories of sections carry a rig-module structure over the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. A suitable definition of 2-Hilbert spaces is given, modifying previous definitions by the use of two-variable adjunctions. We prove that the category of sections of a bundle gerbe fits into this framework, thus obtaining a 2-Hilbert space of sections. In particular, this can be constructed for prequantum bundle gerbes in problems of higher geometric quantisation. We define a dimensional reduction functor and show that the categorical structures introduced on bundle gerbes naturally reduce to their counterparts on hermitean line bundles with connections.

External couplings which fix the probabilities of boundary states induce non-equilibrium steady states characterized by non-zero probability currents flowing through the system. We show that these non-equilibrium steady states minimize a quadratic form which we call `dissipation.' This is closely related to Prigogine's principle of minimum entropy production. We bound the rate of change of the entropy of a driven non-equilibrium steady state relative to the underlying equilibrium state in terms of the flow of probability through the boundary of the process.   We then consider open Markov processes as morphisms in a symmetric monoidal category by splitting up their boundary states into certain sets of `inputs' and `outputs.' Composition corresponds to gluing the outputs of one such open Markov process onto the inputs of another so that the probability flowing out of the first process is equal to the probability flowing into the second. We construct a `black-box' functor characterizing the behavior of an open Markov process in terms of the space of possible steady state probabilities and probability currents along the boundary. The fact that this is a functor means that the behavior of a composite open Markov process can be computed by composing the behaviors of the open Markov processes from which it is composed.

1706.03257,math-ph,"Starting from the continuum definition of helicity, we derive from first principles its different contributions for superfluid vortices. Our analysis shows that an internal twist contribution emerges naturally from the mathematical derivation. This reveals that the spanwise vector that is used to characterise the twist contribution must point in the direction of a surface of constant velocity potential. An immediate consequence of the Seifert framing is that the continuum definition of helicity for a superfluid is trivially zero at all times. It follows that the Gauss-linking number is a more appropriate definition of helicity for superfluids. Despite this, we explain how a quasiclassical limit can arise in a superfluid in which the continuum definition for helicity can be used. This provides a clear connection between a microscopic and a macroscopic description of a superfluid as provided by the Hall-Vinen-Bekarevich-Khalatnikov equations.

1702.04533,nlin,A method for constructing the Lax pairs for nonlinear integrable models is suggested. First we look for a nonlinear invariant manifold to the linearization of the given equation. Examples show that such invariant manifold does exist and can effectively be found. Actually it is defined by a quadratic form. As a result we get a nonlinear Lax pair consisting of the linearized equation and the invariant manifold. Our second step consists of finding an appropriate change of the variables to linearize the found nonlinear Lax pair. The desired change of the variables is again defined by a quadratic form. The method is illustrated by the well-known KdV equation and the modified Volterra chain. New Lax pairs are found. The formal asymptotic expansions for their eigenfunctions are constructed around the singular values of the spectral parameter. By applying the method of the formal diagonalization to these Lax pairs the infinite series of the local conservation laws are obtained for the corresponding nonlinear models.,17,[],9
1707.08443,nlin,"Chimera state is defined as a mixed type of collective state in which synchronized and desynchronized subpopulations of a network of coupled oscillators coexist and the appearance of such anomalous behavior has strong connection to diverse neuronal developments. Most of the previous studies on chimera states are not extensively done in two-dimensional ensembles of coupled oscillators by taking neuronal systems with nonlinear coupling function into account while such ensembles of oscillators are more realistic from a neurobiological point of view. In this paper, we report the emergence and existence of chimera states by considering locally coupled two-dimensional networks of identical oscillators where each node is interacting through nonlinear coupling function. This is in contrast with the existence of chimera states in two-dimensional nonlocally coupled oscillators with rectangular kernel in the coupling function. We find that the presence of nonlinearity in the coupling function plays a key role to produce chimera states in two-dimensional locally coupled oscillators. We analytically verify explicitly in the case of a network of coupled Stuart - Landau oscillators in two dimensions that the obtained results using Ott-Antonsen approach and our analytical finding very well matches with the numerical results. Next, we consider another type of important nonlinear coupling function which exists in neuronal systems, namely chemical synaptic function, through which the nearest-neighbor (locally coupled) neurons interact with each other. In numerical simulations, we consider two paradigmatic neuronal oscillators, namely Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model and Rulkov map for each node which exhibit bursting dynamics.

Super-threshold perturbations induce the emergence of a long-lived structure formed by two back to back fronts that join the two homogeneous states.

1712.08816,nlin,"A certain degree of inhibition is a common trait of dynamical networks in nature, ranging from neuronal and biochemical networks, to social and technological networks. We study here the role of inhibition in a representative dynamical network model, characterizing the dynamics of random threshold networks with both excitatory and inhibitory links. Varying the fraction of excitatory links has a strong effect on the network's population activity and its sensitivity to perturbation. The average degree equation, known to have a strong effect on the dynamics when small, loses its influence on the dynamics as its value increases. Instead, the strength of inhibition is a determinant of dynamics and sensitivity here, allowing for criticality only in a specific corridor of inhibition. This criticality corridor requires that excitation dominates, while the balance region corresponds to maximum sensitivity to perturbation. We develop mean-field approximations of the population activity and sensitivity and find that the network dynamics is independent of degree distribution for high equation. In a minimal model of an adaptive threshold network we demonstrate how the dynamics remains robust against changes in the topology. This adaptive model can be extended in order to generate networks with a controllable activity distribution and specific topologies.",17,['cond-mat'],9

While some of the surrounding bifurcations have been previously described, we present the first detailed analytical and numerical description of these states and present analytically and numerically how they are embedded in the bifurcation structure of the system, arising both from the in-phase as well as the anti-phase solutions, as well as through a saddle-node bifurcation.

1707.09853,nlin,"We study the dynamics of the sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly using a model of the temporal patterns of two sub-regions, mimicking behaviour similar to El Ni\~no Southern Oscillations (ENSO). Specifically, we present the existence, stability, and basins of attraction of the solutions arising in the model system in the space of these parameters: self delay, delay and inter-region coupling strengths. The emergence or suppression of oscillations in our models is a dynamical feature of utmost relevance, as it signals the presence or absence of ENSO-like oscillations. In contrast to the well-known low order model of ENSO, where the influence of the neighbouring regions on the region of interest is modelled as external noise, we consider neighbouring regions as a coupled deterministic dynamical systems. Different parameters yield a rich variety of dynamical patterns in our model, ranging from steady states and homogeneous oscillations to irregular oscillations and coexistence of oscillatory attractors, without explicit inclusion of noise. Interestingly, if we take the self-delay coupling strengths of the two sub-regions to be such that the temperature of one region goes to a fixed point regime when uncoupled, while the other system is in the oscillatory regime, then on coupling both systems show oscillations. We explicitly obtain the basins of attraction for the different steady states and oscillatory states in the model. Our results might be helpful for forecasting of El Ni\~no (or La Ni\~na) progress, as it indicates the combination of initial SST anomalies in the sub-regions that can result in a El Ni\~no/La Ni\~na episodes.

1711.10126,nlin,"The mechanism that maintains atrial fibrillation (AF) remains elusive. One approach to understanding and controlling the mechanism (""AF driver"") is to quantify inter-scale information flow from macroscopic to microscopic behaviors of the cardiac system as a surrogate for the downward causation of the AF driver. We use a numerical model of a cardiac system with one of the potential AF drivers, a rotor, the rotation center of spiral waves, and generate a renormalization group with system descriptions at multiple scales. We find that transfer entropy accurately quantifies the upward and downward information flow between microscopic and macroscopic descriptions of the cardiac system with spiral waves. Because the spatial profile of transfer entropy and intrinsic transfer entropy is identical, there are no synergistic effects in the system. We also find that inter-scale information flow significantly decreases as the description of the system becomes more macroscopic. The downward information flow is significantly smaller than the upward information flow. Lastly, we find that downward information flow from macroscopic to microscopic descriptions of the cardiac system is significantly correlated with the number of rotors, but the higher number of rotors is not necessarily associated with a higher downward information flow. This result contradicts the concept that the rotors are the AF driver, and may account for the conflicting evidence from clinical studies targeting rotors as the AF driver.",17,[],9

Such experiments may be used to support the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory. In this paper we show that many quantum-like features of hydrodynamic excitations can be explained in the framework of the parametrically driven nonlinear Schrodinger equation (DNLSE). It is shown that the nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE) describes the pseudoquantum features of a given pseudoparticle in the Sagdeev pseudopotential just as the ordinary linear Schrodinger equation (LSE) describes the quantum nature of real particles. The NLSE is shown to reduce to nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equation (NHJE) for the phase function of the complex wavefunction. The origin of the wave-particle dual-character in both LSE and NLSE is explained and basic similarities between the two models is highlighted. It is shown that many more pseudoquantum effects (yet to be explored) such as pseudoentanglement, self-interference effect and quantization of pseudoparticle energy are inherent features of classical fluids. Current investigation suggests that emergence of the quantum nature of fluids is independent from dynamics of the bouncing droplets or their interactions with the surface waves instantaneously created by them. In contrast to previous suggestions, it is remarked that intrinsically nonlinear collective excitations of a fluid can drive any particle even a pseudoparticle to behave quantum mechanically. These collective interactions in hydrodynamic model confirm the important nonlocal character (which is a key aspect of the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory) of all the pseudoquantum phenomena.

1705.06248,nlin,"We examine the dynamics of strongly localized periodic solutions (discrete breathers) in two-dimensional array of coupled finite one-dimensional chains of oscillators. Localization patterns with both single and multiple localization sites (multibreathers) are considered.

The model involves symmetric parabolic on-site potential with rigid constraints (the displacement domain of each particle is finite) and a linear nearest-neighbor coupling in the chain, and also between the neighbors in adjacent chains. When the particle approaches the constraint, it undergoes an elastic Newtonian impact. The rigid impact constraints are the only source of nonlinearity in the system. The model allows easy computation of highly accurate approximate solutions for the breathers and multibreathers with an arbitrary set of localization sites in conservative setting. The vibro-impact nonlinearity permits explicit derivation of a monodromy matrix for the breather and multi-breather solutions.

The dynamics of the system are explored both in the absence and presence of diffusion. The parameter space is fully classified in terms of the types and stability of the uniform steady state. In the absence of diffusion the results on the classification of parameter space are supported by simulations of the corresponding vector-field and some trajectories around the uniform steady state. In the presence of diffusion, the main findings are the quantitative analysis relating the domain-size with the reaction and diffusion rates and their corresponding influence on the dynamics of the reaction-diffusion system when perturbed in the neighbourhood of the uniform steady state. Theoretical predictions are supported by numerical simulations both in the presence as well as in the absence of diffusion. Conditions on the domain size with respect to the diffusion and reaction rates are related to the types of diffusion-driven instabilities namely Turing, Hopf and Transcritical types of bifurcations. The first condition is an upper bound on the area of a rectangular domain in terms of the diffusion and reaction rates, which forbids the existence of Hopf and Transcritical types of bifurcations, yet allowing Turing type instability to occur.

Various approximations for the on-site potential with the same basic parameters (height and coordinate of the potential barrier, energy effect and distance between the potential wells) lead to substantially different front velocities. Besides, inclusion of even weak nearest neighbor nonlinearity drastically modifies the front structure and parameters. The energy concentration in the front zone leads to a dominance of the nonlinear term. It turns out that the dynamics can be efficiently studied in terms of an equivalent model with a single degree of freedom. This estimation leads to accurate prediction of the front velocity and parameters of the oscillatory tail.

By using Darboux transformation (DT) method, several types of rogue waves are constructed. Especially, a unified binary DT is found for this nonlocal DS system, thus the solution formulas for nonlocal DSI and DSII equation can be written in an uniform expression. Dynamics of these rogue waves is separately explored. It is shown that the (11)-dimensional rogue waves in nonlocal NLS equation can be bounded for both x and t, or develop collapsing singularities. It is also shown that the (12)-dimensional line rogue waves in the nonlocal DS equations can be bounded for all space and time, or have finite-time blowing-ups. All these types depend on the values of free parameters introduced in the solution. In addition, the dynamics patterns in the multi- and higher-order rogue waves exhibits more richer structures, most of which have no counterparts in the corresponding local nonlinear equations.",17,[],9

The direct numerical modelling of this and similar problems is challenging and has natural limitations. We develop a semi-analytical approach, based on the use of several matched asymptotic multiple-scale expansions and averaging with respect to the fast space variable, leading to the coupled Ostrovsky equations in bonded regions and uncoupled Korteweg-de Vries equations in the delaminated region. We show that the semi-analytical approach agrees well with direct numerical simulations and use it to study the nonlinear dynamics and scattering of the radiating solitary wave in a wide range of bi-layers with delamination. The results indicate that radiating solitary waves could help us to control the integrity of layered structures with imperfect interfaces.",17,[],9

Here we explore the complexity of its dynamics in the classical and semi-classical regimes, using the technique of ordinal pattern analysis. This is of particular relevance to potential experiments in the semi-classical regime. We unveil different dynamical regimes within the chaotic range, which cannot be detected with more traditional statistical tools. These regimes are characterized by different hierarchies and probabilities of the ordinal patterns. Correlation between the Lyapunov exponent and the permutation entropy is revealed that leads to interpret dips in the Lyapunov exponent as transitions in the dynamics of the system.",17,[],9

Taking the coupled Mel'nikov system comprised of two-component short waves and one-component long wave as an example, its general equation-dark-dark soliton solutions in Gram determinant form are constructed through the KP hierarchy reduction method. The dynamics of single dark-dark soliton and two dark-dark solitons are discussed in detail. It can be shown that the collisions of dark-dark solitons are elastic and energies of the solitons in different components completely transmit through. In addition, the dark-dark soliton bound states including both stationary and moving cases are also investigated. An interesting feature for the coupled Mel'nikov system is that the stationary dark-dark soliton bound states can exist for all possible combinations of nonlinearity coefficients including all-positive, all-negative and mixed types, while the moving case are possible when they take opposite signs or they are both negative. The dynamics and several interesting structures of the solutions are illustrated through some figures.",17,[],9

Further, suppression of chaos is facilitated when the threshold-activated migration is more rapid than the intrinsic population dynamics of a patch. Additionally, networks with large number of nodes open to the environment, readily yield stable steady states.

This is a striking example of an \it individual TS which can be much easier discriminated in experiment than the toroidal dipole resonance embracing many states. The TS acquires the lowest energy due to the huge prolate axial deformation in equationMg. The result persists for different Skyrme parameterizations (SLy6, SVbas, SkM*).

A comprehensive understanding of these systems goes beyond the traditional configuration interactions approach formulated in the Hilbert space of localized states (nuclear shell model) and requires an open quantum system description. The complex-energy Gamow Shell Model (GSM) provides such a framework as it is capable of describing resonant and non-resonant many-body states on equal footing.   To make reliable predictions, quality input is needed that allows for the full uncertainty quantification of theoretical results. In this study, we carry out the optimization of an effective GSM (one-body and two-body) interaction in the equation shell model space. The resulting interaction is expected to describe nuclei with equation at the equation-shell interface.   The optimized one-body potential reproduces nucleon-equationHe scattering phase shifts up to an excitation energy of 20 MeV. The two-body interaction built on top of the optimized one-body field is adjusted to the bound and unbound ground-state binding energies and selected excited states of the Helium, Lithium, and Beryllium isotopes up to equation.

An analysis of the antineutrino spectra that is based on a summation over all fission fragment beta-decays, using nuclear database input, explains all of the features seen in the Daya Bay evolution data.

We derive expressions of the static and dynamic self-energy up to the third order, by taking into account the set of diagrams required when either the skeleton or nonskeleton expansions of the single-particle propagator are assumed. A hierarchy of importance among different diagrams is revealed, and a particular emphasis is given to a third-order diagram (see Fig. 2c) that is expected to play a significant role among those featuring an interaction-irreducible three-nucleon force.

Due to the longer range coulomb repulsion between protons, the system has structural inhomogeneities. Several interactions tailored to reproduce nuclear matter plus screened Coulomb term reproduce these inhomogeneities known as nuclear pasta. These structural inhomogeneities, located in the crust of neutron stars, can also arise in expanding systems depending on the thermodynamic conditions (temperature, proton fraction, ...) and the expansion velocity. Purpose: We aim to find the dynamics of the fragments formation for expanding systems simulated according to the little big bang model. This expansion resembles the evolution of neutron stars merger. Method: We study the dynamics of the nucleons with semiclassical molecular dynamics models. Starting with an equilibrium configuration, we expand the system homogeneously until we arrive to an asymptotic configuration (i. e. very low final densities). We study, with four different cluster recognition algorithms, the fragment distribution throughout this expansion and the dynamics of the cluster formation. Results: Studying the topology of the equilibrium states, before the expansion, we reproduced the known pasta phases plus a novel phase we called pregnocchi, consisting of proton aggregates embedded in a neutron sea. We have identified different fragmentation regimes, depending on the initial temperature and fragment velocity.

This paper proposes a new symmetry scheme also based on SU(3). This proxy-SU(3) can be applied to well-deformed nuclei, is simple to use, and can yield analytic predictions. Purpose: To present the new scheme and its microscopic motivation, and to test it using a Nilsson model calculation with the original shell model orbits and with the new proxy set. Method: We invoke an approximate, analytic, treatment of the Nilsson model, that allows the above vetting and yet is also transparent in understanding the approximations involved in the new proxy-SU(3). Results: It is found that the new scheme yields a Nilsson diagram for well-deformed nuclei that is very close to the original Nilsson diagram. The specific levels of approximation in the new scheme are also shown, for each major shell. Conclusions: The new proxy-SU(3) scheme is a good approximation to the full set of orbits in a major shell. Being able to replace a complex shell model calculation with a symmetry-based description now opens up the possibility to predict many properties of nuclei analytically and often in a parameter-free way.

After 15 years since the proposal of the alpha condensation concept a critical assessment of this idea will be given. Alpha gas states in other nuclei like 16O and 13C will be considered.

By taking moments of the resulting Boltzmann equation, we obtain the dynamical equations used in the hydrodynamic stage which include the effects of both shear and bulk viscosities. At freeze-out, we use anisotropic Cooper-Frye freeze-out performed on a fixed-energy-density hypersurface to convert to hadrons.

1703.09396,nucl-th,"The nuclear force has been understood to have a repulsive core at short distances, similar to a molecular force, since Jastrow proposed it in 1951. The existence of the repulsion was experimentally confirmed from the proton-proton scattering 1S0 phase shift, which becomes negative beyond 230 MeV. This repulsion is essential for preventing the nucleon-nucleon system from collapsing by attraction. The origin of the repulsion has been considered to be due to the Pauli principle, similar to the repulsion originally revealed in alpha-alpha scattering, in many studies including recent lattice QCD calculations. On the other hand, very recently it was shown that an inter-nuclear potential including alpha-alpha interactions has a Luneburg-lens-like attraction at short distances rather than repulsion. We show that the nuclear force with an attractive potential at short distances that reproduces the experimental phase shifts well has a Luneburg-lens-like structural Pauli attractive core (SPAC) at short distances and acts as apparent repulsion. The apparent repulsion is caused by the deeply embedded unobservable Pauli forbidden state similar to nucleus-nucleus potentials.",17,"['hep-ph', 'nucl-ex']",11

The lowest non-vanishing terms of the operators are derived and the dominant contributions to matrix elements are discussed. The astrophysical equation factor computed with some of these contributions in a three-body equation model is in agreement with the recent low-energy experimental data of the LUNA collaboration. This confirms that a correct treatment of the isovector equation transitions involving small isospin-one admixtures in the wave functions should be able to provide an explanation of the data without adjustable parameter.

1710.03895,nucl-th,"In non-central relativistic heavy ion collisions, the created matter possesses a large initial orbital angular momentum. Particles produced in the collisions could be polarized globally in the direction of the orbital angular momentum due to spin-orbit coupling. Recently, the STAR experiment has presented polarization signals for equation hyperons and possible spin alignment signals for equation mesons. Here we discuss the effects of finite coverage on these observables. The results from a multi-phase transport and a toy model both indicate that a pseudorapidity coverage narrower than equation will generate a larger value for the extracted equation-meson equation parameter; thus a finite coverage can lead to an artificial deviation of equation from 1/3.

This paper aims for a coherent view on all charged current charged pion production data that are avaible from the experiments MiniBooNE, the near detector experiment at T2K and MINERvA. [Methods] Pion production is treated through excitations of nucleon resonances, including background terms, and deep inelastic scattering. The final state interactions of the produced pions are described within the Giessen-Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) implementation of quantum-kinetic transport theory. [Results] Results are given for MiniBooNE, the near detector experiment at T2K and for MINERvA. While the theoretical results for MiniBooNE differ from the data both in shape and magnitude, their agreement both with the T2K and the MINERvA data is good for all pion and lepton observables. Predictions for pion spectra are shown for MicroBooNE and NOvA.

The most notable consequence of this forward-backward symmetry breaking is the observation of rapidity-odd directed flow for charged particles. On the other hand, the production points for heavy quarks are forward-backward symmetric and shifted in the transverse plane with respect to the fireball. The drag of heavy quarks from the asymmetrically distributed thermalized matter generates a large directed flow for heavy flavor mesons. We predict a very large rapidity odd directed flow of equation mesons in non-central Au-Au collisions at equation GeV, equation equation equation than for charged particles.

We choose only electron-nucleus data that overlaps with this region. In order to clearify the analysis, we split the data sets into three groups and draw conclusion separately from each one of them.

The latter two are included as a benchmark to quantify the effect of various nuclear effects. All the six models are often used in neutrino scattering studies.

While, however, this organization can, along with the observed behavior of measuring instruments, be described by means of classical physics, it cannot be predicted by means of classical physics, but only, probabilistically or statistically, by means of quantum mechanics, or in high-energy physics, by means of quantum field theory (or possibly some alternative theories within each scope).

The metasurface is described in terms of Lorentzian electric and magnetic surface susceptibilities, equation and equation, respectively, and its resonant frequencies are periodically modulated in both space and time. The unknown scattered fields are then expressed in terms of Floquet modes, which when used with the GSTCs, lead to a system of field matrix equations. The resulting set of linear equations are then solved numerically to determine the total scattered fields. Using a finite-difference time domain (FDTD) solver, the proposed method is validated and confirmed for several examples of modulation depths (equation) and frequencies (equation). Finally, the computed steady-state scattered fields are Fourier propagated analytically, for visualization of refracted harmonics.

1709.02867,physics,"In the Lagrangian theory of guiding center motion, an effective magnetic field equation appears prominently in the equations of motion. Because the parallel component of this field can vanish, there is a range of parallel velocities where the Lagrangian guiding center equations of motion are either ill-defined or very badly behaved. Moreover, the velocity dependence of equation greatly complicates the identification of canonical variables, and therefore the formulation of symplectic integrators for guiding center dynamics. This Letter introduces a simple coordinate transformation that alleviates both of these problems simultaneously. In the new coordinates, the Liouville volume element is equal to the toroidal cotravariant component of the magnetic field. Consequently, the large-velocity singularity is completely eliminated. Moreover, passing from the new coordinate system to canonical coordinates is extremely simple, even if the magnetic field is devoid of flux surfaces.

The complex and merged multiple magnetic clouds appear as the in-situ signature of the interacting CMEs. The Alfven waves are speculated to be one of the major possible energy exchange/dissipation mechanism during the interaction. However, no such observational evidence has been found in the literature. The case studies of CME-CME collision events suggest that the magnetic and thermal energy of the CME is converted into the kinetic energy. Moreover, the magnetic reconnection process is justified to be responsible for the merging of multiple magnetic clouds. Here, we present unambiguous evidence of sunward torsional Alfven waves in the interacting region after the super-elastic collision of multiple CMEs. The Walen relation is used to confirm the presence of Alfven waves in the interacting region of multiple CMEs/magnetic clouds.

For the TCSs of C70, C76, C78, and C84 the agreement between the energy positions of the very sharp resonances, corresponding to the binding energies (BEs) of the resultant fullerene negative ions, and the measured EAs is outstanding.

1711.01305,physics,"We present the performance of a superconducting nanowire that can be operated in two detection modes: i) as a kinetic inductance detector (KID) or ii) as a single-photon detector (SPD). Two superconducting nanowires developed for use as single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are embedded as the inductive (L) component in resonant inductor/capacitor (LC) circuits coupled to a microwave transmission line. The capacitors are low loss commercial chip capacitors and limit the internal quality factor of the resonators to approximately equation. The resonator quality factor, equation, is dominated by the coupling to the feedline and limits the detection bandwidth to on the order of 1MHz. When operated in KID mode, the detectors are AC biased with tones at their resonant frequencies of 45.85 and 91.81MHz. In the low-bias, standard KID mode, a single photon produces a hot spot that does not turn an entire section of the line normal but only increases the kinetic inductance. In the high-bias, critical KID mode, a photon event turns a section of the line normal and the resonance is destroyed until the normal region is dissipated. When operated as an SPD in Geiger mode, the resonators are DC biased through cryogenic bias tees and each photon produces a sharp voltage step followed by a ringdown signal at the resonant frequency of the detector which is converted to a standard pulse with an envelop detector. We show that AC biasing in the critical KID mode is inferior to the sensitivity achieved in DC-biased SPD mode due to the small fraction of time spent near the critical current with an AC bias.",17,[],5
1712.05215,physics,"The identification of meaningful reaction coordinates plays a key role in the study of complex molecular systems whose essential dynamics is characterized by rare or slow transition events. In a recent publication, precise defining characteristics of such reaction coordinates were identified and linked to the existence of a so-called transition manifold. This theory gives rise to a novel numerical method for the pointwise computation of reaction coordinates that relies on short parallel MD simulations only, but yields accurate approximation of the long time behavior of the system under consideration. This article presents an extension of the method towards practical applicability in computational chemistry. It links the newly defined reaction coordinates to concepts from transition path theory and Markov state model building. The main result is an alternative computational scheme that allows for a global computation of reaction coordinates based on commonly available types of simulation data, such as single long molecular trajectories, or the push-forward of arbitrary canonically-distributed point clouds. It is based on a Galerkin approximation of the transition manifold reaction coordinates, that can be tuned to individual requirements by the choice of the Galerkin ansatz functions.

1705.06904,physics,"Understanding the mechanisms underlying the formation of cultural traits, such as preferences, opinions and beliefs is an open challenge. Trait formation is intimately connected to cultural dynamics, which has been the focus of a variety of quantitative models. Recently, some studies have emphasized the importance of connecting those models to snapshots of cultural dynamics that are empirically accessible. By analyzing data obtained from different sources, it has been suggested that culture has properties that are universally present, and that empirical cultural states differ systematically from randomized counterparts. Hence, a question about the mechanism responsible for the observed patterns naturally arises. This study proposes a stochastic structural model for generating cultural states that retain those robust, empirical properties. One ingredient of the model, already used in previous work, assumes that every individual's set of traits is partly dictated by one of several, universal ""rationalities"", informally postulated by several social science theories. The second, new ingredient taken from the same theories assumes that, apart from a dominant rationality, each individual also has a certain exposure to the other rationalities. It is shown that both ingredients are required for reproducing the empirical regularities. This key result suggests that the effects of cultural dynamics in the real world can be described as an interplay of multiple, mixing rationalities, and thus provides indirect evidence for the class of social science theories postulating such mixing. The model should be seen as a static, effective description of culture, while a dynamical, more fundamental description is left for future research.",17,['cs'],5

Bulk density is adjusted to obtain a bulk pressure of approximately pb = 1.1pcr where pcr is the critical pressure of the working fluid. Top-to-bottom temperature differences investigated are DT = 5 K, 10 K, and 20 K, where Ttop/bot = Tpb - DT / 2; buoyancy effects are neglected.

Real-fluid effects cause visible deviations from classical scaling laws in the mean velocity profile. Enstrophy generation due stretching and tilting decreases with DT. The proximity to the pseudotransitioning layer inhibits the intensity of the velocity fluctuations, while enhancing the density and temperature fluctuations. Conditional probability analysis reveals that the sheet of fluid undergoing pseudophase change is characterized by a dramatic reduction in the kurtosis of density fluctuations and becomes thinner as DT is increased.

As the season length for shorefast ice decreases and temperatures warm permafrost soils, coastlines are more susceptible to erosion from storm waves.

Stakeholders and decision makers increasingly need models capable of scenario-based predictions to assess and mitigate the effects of coastal morphology on infrastructure and land use. Our research uses Gaussian process models to forecast Arctic coastal erosion along the Beaufort Sea near Drew Point, AK. Gaussian process regression is a data-driven modeling methodology capable of extracting patterns and trends from data-sparse environments such as remote Arctic coastlines. To train our model, we use annual coastline positions and near-shore summer temperature averages from existing datasets and extend these data by extracting additional coastlines from satellite imagery.

We study the dynamics of disease spreading in social-contact multiplex networks when the recovery of infected nodes depends on resources from healthy neighbors in the social layer. We investigate how degree heterogeneity affects the spreading dynamics. Using theoretical analysis and simulations we find that degree heterogeneity promotes disease spreading. The phase transition of the infected density is hybrid and increases smoothly from zero to a finite small value at the first invasion threshold and then suddenly jumps at the second invasion threshold. We also find a hysteresis loop in the transition of the infected density. We further investigate how an overlap in the edges between two layers affects the spreading dynamics. We find that when the amount of overlap is smaller than a critical value the phase transition is hybrid and there is a hysteresis loop, otherwise the phase transition is continuous and the hysteresis loop vanishes. In addition, the edge overlap allows an epidemic outbreak when the transmission rate is below the first invasion threshold, but suppresses any explosive transition when the transmission rate is above the first invasion threshold.",17,[],5

1710.01261,physics,"The turbulence statistics of the intermittent region in a supersonic turbulent boundary layer are studied by direct numerical simulation. Recently, Kwon et al. (2016) have shown that this intermittent behavior, consisting of the coexistence of turbulent and non-turbulent flows separated by an interface, could result in perils when the traditional Reynolds decomposition is used to analyze data. Here, we extend the study of turbulent/non-turbulent interfaces to the supersonic regime and report turbulence statistics conditioned to the interface. We show that the mathematical artefact of the traditional Reynolds/Favre decomposition contaminates the Reynolds stresses and thermal statistics. Our conditional statistics provide direct evidence that turbulent flow possesses positive Reynolds shear stress everywhere, whereas non-turbulent flow carries zero Reynolds shear stress. The thermal statistics of turbulent and non-turbulent flows exhibit opposite trends in the intermittent region, and the difference can be traced back to the variation of total temperature resulting from the Prandtl number.",17,[],5
1712.03407,physics,"The formation and stability of social hierarchies is a question of general relevance. Here, we propose a simple generalized theoretical model for establishing social hierarchy via pair-wise interactions between individuals and investigate its stability. In each interaction or fight, the probability of ""winning"" depends solely on the relative societal status of the participants, and the winner has a gain of status whereas there is an equal loss to the loser. The interactions are characterized by two parameters. The first parameter represents how much can be lost, and the second parameter represents the degree to which even a small difference of status can guarantee a win for the higher-status individual. Depending on the parameters, the resulting status distributions reach either a continuous unimodal form or lead to a totalitarian end state with one high-status individual and all other individuals having status approaching zero. However, we find that in the latter case long-lived intermediary distributions often exist, which can give the illusion of a stable society. As we show, our model allows us to make predictions consistent with animal interaction data and their evolution over a number of years. Moreover, by implementing a simple, but realistic rule that restricts interactions to sufficiently similar-status individuals, the stable or long-lived distributions acquire high-status structure corresponding to a distinct high-status class. Using household income as a proxy for societal status in human societies, we find agreement over their entire range from the low-to-middle-status parts to the characteristic high-status ""tail"". We discuss how the model provides a conceptual framework for understanding the origin of social hierarchy and the factors which lead to the preservation or deterioration of the societal structure.",17,[],5

1708.05238,physics,"We addressed the carrier dynamics in so-called G-centers in silicon (consisting of substitutional-interstitial carbon pairs interacting with interstitial silicons) obtained via ion implantation into a silicon-on-insulator wafer. For this point defect in silicon emitting in the telecommunication wavelength range, we unravel the recombination dynamics by time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. More specifically, we performed detailed photoluminescence experiments as a function of excitation energy, incident power, irradiation fluence and temperature in order to study the impact of radiative and non-radiative recombination channels on the spectrum, yield and lifetime of G-centers. The sharp line emitting at 969 meV (equation1280 nm) and the broad asymmetric sideband developing at lower energy share the same recombination dynamics as shown by time-resolved experiments performed selectively on each spectral component. This feature accounts for the common origin of the two emission bands which are unambiguously attributed to the zero-phonon line and to the corresponding phonon sideband. In the framework of the Huang-Rhys theory with non-perturbative calculations, we reach an estimation of 1.6equation0.1 equation for the spatial extension of the electronic wave function in the G-center. The radiative recombination time measured at low temperature lies in the 6 ns-range. The estimation of both radiative and non-radiative recombination rates as a function of temperature further demonstrate a constant radiative lifetime. Finally, although G-centers are shallow levels in silicon, we find a value of the Debye-Waller factor comparable to deep levels in wide-bandgap materials.

The results show that ionic activity in most electrolytes is dominated by three types of electrostatic forces: (i) mean-field charge screening, (ii) solvation, and (iii) Coulomb correlations, both ""over-screening"" (charge oscillations) and ""under-screening"" (extending beyond the Debye screening length).",17,['cond-mat'],5
1703.10396,physics,"The paper addresses the hydrodynamic behavior of a sphere close to a micro-patterned superhydrophobic surface described in terms of alternated no-slip and perfect-slip stripes. Physically, the perfect-slip stripes model the parallel grooves where a large gas cushion forms between fluid and solid wall, giving rise to slippage at the gas-liquid interface. The potential of the boundary element method (BEM) in dealing with mixed no-slip/perfect-slip boundary conditions is exploited to systematically calculate the mobility tensor for different particle-to-wall relative positions and for different particle radii. The particle hydrodynamics is characterized by a non trivial mobility field which presents a distinct near wall behavior where the wall patterning directly affects the particle motion. In the far field, the effects of the wall pattern can be accurately represented via an effective description in terms of a homogeneous wall with a suitably defined apparent slippage. The trajectory of the sphere under the action of an external force is also described in some detail. A resonant regime is found when the frequency of the transversal component of the force matches a characteristic crossing frequency imposed by the wall pattern. It is found that, under resonance, the particle undergoes a mean transversal drift. Since the resonance condition depends on the particle radius the effect can in principle be used to conceive devices for particle sorting based on superhydrophobic surfaces.",17,[],5
1707.05810,physics,"One of the many ways cells transmit information within their volume is through steady spatial gradients of different proteins. However, the mechanism through which proteins without any sources or sinks form such single-cell gradients is not yet fully understood. One of the models for such gradient formation, based on differential diffusion, is limited to proteins with large ratios of their diffusion constants or to specific protein-large molecule interactions. We introduce a novel mechanism for gradient formation via the coupling of the proteins within a single cell with a molecule, that we call a ""pronogen"", whose action is similar to that of morphogens in multi-cell assemblies, the pronogen is produced with a fixed flux at one side of the cell. This coupling results in an effectively non-linear diffusion degradation model for the pronogen dynamics within the cell, which leads to a steady-state gradient of the protein concentration.

Accordingly, a comparison between observational data and theoretical expectations might then be strongly compromised. In the present paper, we give the principles of relativistic localizing systems so as to bypass this issue. Such systems will allow to locate users endowed with receivers and, in addition, to localize any spacetime event. These localizing systems are made up of relativistic auto-locating positioning sub-systems supplemented by an extra satellite. They indicate that spacetime must be supplied everywhere with an unexpected local four dimensional projective structure besides the well-known three dimensional relativistic projective one. As a result, the spacetime manifold can be seen as a generalized Cartan space modeled on a four dimensional real projective space, i.e., a spacetime with both a local four dimensional projective structure and a compatible (pseudo-)Riemannian structure.

1706.08161,physics,"The variability response function (VRF) is generalized to statically determinate Euler Bernoulli beams with arbitrary stress-strain laws following Cauchy elastic behavior. The VRF is a Green's function that maps the spectral density function (SDF) of a statistically homogeneous random field describing the correlation structure of input uncertainty to the variance of a response quantity. The appeal of such Green's functions is that the variance can be determined for any correlation structure by a trivial computation of a convolution integral. The method introduced in this work derives VRFs in closed form for arbitrary nonlinear Cauchy-elastic constitutive laws and is demonstrated through three examples. It is shown why and how higher order spectra of the random field affect the response variance for nonlinear constitutive laws. In the general sense, the VRF for a statically determinate beam is found to be a matrix kernel whose inner product by a matrix of higher order SDFs and statistical moments is integrated to give the response variance. The resulting VRF matrix is unique regardless of the random field's marginal probability density function (PDF) and SDFs.",17,[],5

A heating power scan in mixed hydrogen/helium plasmas reveals a change in mode activity with increasing heating power. At low power (<50 kW) modes with beta-induced Alfven eigenmode (BAE) frequency scaling are observed. At higher power modes consistent with an analysis of nonconventional Global Alfven Eigenmodes (GAEs) are observed, the subject of this work. We have computed the mode continuum, and identified GAE structures using the ideal MHD solver CKA and the gyrokinetic code EUTERPE. An analytic model for ICRH-heated minority ions is used to estimate the fast ion temperature from the hydrogen species. Linear growth rate scans using a local flux surface stability calculation, LGRO, are performed. These studies demonstrate growth from circulating particles whose speed is significantly less than the Alfven speed, and are resonant with the mode through harmonics of the Fourier decomposition of the strongly-shaped heliac magnetic field. They reveal drive is possible with a small, hot energetic tail of the hydrogen species. Local linear growth rate scans are also complemented with global calculations from CKA and EUTERPE. These qualitatively confirm the findings from the LGRO study, and show that the inclusion of finite Larmor radius effects can reduce the growth rate by a factor of three, but do not affect marginal stability. Finally, a study of damping of the global mode with the thermal plasma is conducted, computing continuum, and the damping arising from parallel electric fields. We find that continuum damping is of order 0.1% for the configuration studied. The inclusion of resistivity lifts the damping to 19%. Such large damping is consistent with experimental observations that in absence of drive the mode decays rapidly (~0.1 ms).",17,[],5
1705.00362,physics,"CMS-HF Calorimeters have been undergoing a major upgrade for the last couple of years to alleviate the problems encountered during Run I, especially in the PMT and the readout systems. In this poster, the problems caused by the old PMTs installed in the detectors and their solutions will be explained. Initially, regular PMTs with thicker windows, causing large Cherenkov radiation, were used. Instead of the light coming through the fibers from the detector, stray muons passing through the PMT itself produce Cherenkov radiation in the PMT window, resulting in erroneously large signals. Usually, large signals are the result of very high-energy particles in the calorimeter and are tagged as important. As a result, these so-called window events generate false triggers. Four-anode PMTs with thinner windows were selected to reduce these window events. Additional channels also help eliminate such remaining events through algorithms comparing the output of different PMT channels.

The Cauchy invariants equation and the Cauchy formula, relating the vorticity and the Jacobian of the Lagrangian map, are shown to be two expressions of this Lie-advection invariance, which are duals of each other (specifically, Hodge dual). Actually, this is shown to be an instance of a general result, which holds for flow both in flat (Euclidean) space and in a curved Riemannian space: any Lie-advection invariant p-form which is exact (i.e. is a differential of a (p-1)-form) has an associated Cauchy invariants equation and a Cauchy formula.

This study provides a solid theoretical deduction regarding the isotope fractionation taking place during fragmentation in EI-MS. Both intermolecular and intramolecular isotope fractionations present in dehalogenation processes, influencing the isotope ratios of detected ions. In general, intermolecular isotope fractionation positively affects the isotope ratios of precursor ions but inversely impacts those of the corresponding product ions. Molecular ions are normally affected by one type of intermolecular isotope fractionation only during the dehalogenation from parent ions to their product ions. While product ions can be impacted by two types of intermolecular isotope fractionations, namely, the inverse intermolecular isotope fractionation from parent ions to their product ions and the normal intermolecular isotope fractionation from the product ions to their further dehalogenated product ions. For a compound having position-distinct isotope ratios, if dehalogenation reacts on only one position, the intermolecular isotope fractionation taking palace in this reaction is normal for the detected precursor ion, but ineffective to the product ion isotope ratio in comparison with that of the total precursor ions. On the other hand, intramolecular isotope fractionation positively affects the isotope ratios of product ions only.

The method uses a transcleral illumination which provides a high numerical aperture in a dark field configuration. The light backscattered by the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) and Choroid layer provides a forward illumination for the upper layer of the retina, thus providing a transmission illumination condition.

We have employed a kinetic model as a more comprehensive theory than the fluid one, and utilized a fully kinetic simulation approach (both ions and electrons are treated based on the Vlasov equation). In the simulation approach, these solitons are excited self-consistently by employing the nonlinear process of IA solitons formation from an initial density perturbation (IDP). The effect of the size of IDPs on the chain formation is proved by the simulation code as a benchmark test. It is shown that the IA solitons, in presence of trapped electrons, can retain their features (both in spatial and velocity direction) after successive mutual collisions. The collisions here include encounters of IA solitons with the same trapping parameter, while differing in size. Kinetic simulation results reveal a complicated behavior during a collision between IA solitons in contrast to the fluid theory predictions and simulations.

Diffusion weighted signal is normally acquired on single or multiple shells in q-space. Signal samples are typically distributed uniformly on different shells to make them invariant to the orientation of structures within tissue, or the laboratory coordinate frame. The Electrostatic Energy Minimization (EEM) method, originally proposed for single shell sampling scheme in dMRI, was recently generalized to multi-shell schemes, called Generalized EEM (GEEM). GEEM has been successfully used in the Human Connectome Project (HCP). However, EEM does not directly address the goal of optimal sampling, i.e., achieving large angular separation between sampling points. In this paper, we propose a more natural formulation, called Spherical Code (SC), to directly maximize the minimal angle between different samples in single or multiple shells. We consider not only continuous problems to design single or multiple shell sampling schemes, but also discrete problems to uniformly extract sub-sampled schemes from an existing single or multiple shell scheme, and to order samples in an existing scheme. We propose five algorithms to solve the above problems, including an incremental SC (ISC), a sophisticated greedy algorithm called Iterative Maximum Overlap Construction (IMOC), an 1-Opt greedy method, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) method, and a Constrained Non-Linear Optimization (CNLO) method. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use the SC formulation for single or multiple shell sampling schemes in dMRI.

1710.03539,physics,"Zygotic genome activation (ZGA), the onset of transcription after initial quiescence, is a major developmental step in many species, which occurs after ten cell divisions in Zebrafish embryos. How transcription factor-chromatin interactions evolve during early development to support ZGA is largely unknown. We established single molecule tracking in live developing Zebrafish embryos using reflected light-sheet microscopy to visualize the general transcription factor TATA-binding protein (TBP), and developed a novel data acquisition and analysis scheme to extract kinetic information during fast cell cycles. The chromatin-bound fraction of TBP increases during early development, compatible with increasing transcriptional activity. By quantifying TBP and DNA concentrations and their binding kinetics, we device a physical model of how the nuclear volume, which decreases during early development, enhances TBP-chromatin associations. Our single molecule data suggest that the shrinking nucleus is a major driving force and timer of ZGA in Zebrafish embryos.",17,[],5
1703.02817,physics,"Purpose: To investigate the effect of realistic microstructural geometry on the susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) signal in white matter (WM), with application to demyelination.   Methods: Previous work has modeled susceptibility-weighted signals under the assumption that axons are cylindrical. In this work, we explore the implications of this assumption by considering the effect of more realistic geometries. A three-compartment WM model incorporating relevant properties based on literature was used to predict the MR signal. Myelinated axons were modeled with several cross-sectional geometries of increasing realism: nested circles, warped/elliptical circles and measured axonal geometries from electron micrographs. Signal simulations from the different microstructural geometries were compared to measured signals from a Cuprizone mouse model with varying degrees of demyelination.   Results: Results from simulation suggest that axonal geometry affects the MR signal. Predictions with realistic models were significantly different compared to circular models under the same microstructural tissue properties, for simulations with and without diffusion.   Conclusion: The geometry of axons affects the MR signal significantly. Literature estimates of myelin susceptibility, which are based on fitting biophysical models to the MR signal, are likely to be biased by the assumed geometry, as will any derived microstructural properties.",17,[],5
1706.00330,physics,"The paradox of the energy transition is that the low marginal costs of new renewable energy sources (RES) drag electricity prices down and discourage investments in flexible productions that are needed to compensate for the lack of dispatchability of the new RES. The energy transition thus discourages the investments that are required for its own harmonious expansion. To investigate how this paradox can be overcome, we argue that, under certain assumptions, future electricity prices are rather accurately modeled from the residual load obtained by subtracting non-flexible productions from the load. Armed with the resulting economic indicator, we investigate future revenues for European power plants with various degree of flexibility. We find that, if neither carbon taxes nor fuel prices change, flexible productions would be financially rewarded better and sooner if the energy transition proceeds faster but at more or less constant total production, i.e. by reducing the production of thermal power plants at the same rate as the RES production increases. Less flexible productions, on the other hand, would see their revenue grow more moderately. Our results indicate that a faster energy transition with a quicker withdrawal of thermal power plants would reward flexible productions faster.",17,['q-fin'],5
1712.09144,physics,"A new model order reduction approach is proposed for parametric steady-state nonlinear fluid flows characterized by shocks and discontinuities whose spatial locations and orientations are strongly parameter dependent. In this method, solutions in the predictive regime are approximated using a linear superposition of parameter dependent basis. The sought after parametric reduced-basis are obtained by transporting the snapshots in a spatially and parametrically dependent transport field. Key to the proposed approach is the observation that the transport fields are typically smooth and continuous, despite the solution themselves not being so. As a result, the transport fields can be accurately expressed using a low-order polynomial expansion. Similar to traditional projection-based model order reduction approaches, the proposed method is formulated mathematically as a residual minimization problem for the generalized coordinates. The proposed approach is also integrated with well-known hyper-reduction strategies to obtain significant computational speed-ups. The method is successfully applied to the reduction of a parametric 1-D flow in a converging-diverging nozzle, a parametric 2-D supersonic flow over a forward facing step and a parametric 2-D jet diffusion flame in a combustor.",17,[],5

1707.01863,physics,"The scaling of plasmoid instability maximum linear growth rate with respect to Lundquist number equation in a Sweet-Parker current sheet, equation, indicates that at high equation, the current sheet will break apart before it approaches the Sweet-Parker width. Therefore, a proper description for the onset of the plasmoid instability must incorporate the evolving process of the current sheet. We carry out a series of two-dimensional simulations and develop diagnostics to separate fluctuations from an evolving background. It is found that the fluctuation amplitude starts to grow only when the linear growth rate is sufficiently large (equation) to overcome convective losses. The linear growth rate continues to rise until the sizes of plasmoids become comparable to the inner layer width of the tearing mode. At this point the current sheet is disrupted and the instability enters the early nonlinear regime. The growth rate suddenly decreases, but the fluctuation amplitude continues to grow until it reaches nonlinear saturation. We identify important time scales of the instability development, as well as scalings for the linear growth rate, current sheet width, and dominant wavenumber at current sheet disruption. These scalings depend on not only the Lundquist number, but also the initial noise amplitude. A phenomenological model that reproduces scalings from simulation results is proposed. The model incorporates the effect of reconnection outflow, which is crucial for yielding a critical Lundquist number equation below which disruption does not occur. The critical Lundquist number equation is not a constant value but has a weak dependence on the noise amplitude.",17,['astro-ph'],5

A difficulty in understanding the mechanism of this phenomenon is that different outputs differ considerably in their scaling behaviors.

Our model suggests that the increased likelihood of finding required collaborations in a larger population can explain this superlinear scaling, which our model predicts to be non-power-law. Moreover, the extent of superlinearity should be greater for activities that require more collaborators.

1709.02841,physics,"A theory is proposed that describes mutual conversion of two electromagnetic modes in cold low-density plasma, specifically, in the high-frequency limit where the ion response is negligible. In contrast to the classic (Landau--Zener-type) theory of mode conversion, the region of resonant coupling in low-density plasma is not necessarily narrow, so the coupling matrix cannot be approximated with its first-order Taylor expansion; also, the initial conditions are set up differently. For the case of strong magnetic shear, a simple method is identified for preparing a two-mode wave such that it transforms into a single-mode wave upon entering high-density plasma. The theory can be used for reduced modeling of wave-power input in fusion plasmas. In particular, applications are envisioned in stellarator research, where the mutual conversion of two electromagnetic modes near the plasma edge is a known issue.",17,[],5
1702.06837,physics,"The effects that energetic trapped ions have on linear resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities are studied in a reduced model that captures the essential physics driving or damping the modes through variations in the magnetic shear. The drift-kinetic orbital interaction of a slowing down distribution of trapped energetic ions with a resistive MHD instability is integrated to a scalar contribution to the perturbed pressure, and entered into an asymptotic matching formalism for the resistive MHD dispersion relation. Toroidal magnetic field line curvature is included to model trapping in the particle distribution, in an otherwise cylindrical model. The focus is on a configuration that is driven unstable to the m/n = 2/1 mode by increasing pressure, where m is the poloidal mode number and n the toroidal. The particles and pressure can affect the mode both in the core region where there can be low and reversed shear and outside the resonant surface in significant positive shear. The results show that the energetic ions damp and stabilize the mode when orbiting in significant positive shear, increasing the marginal stability boundary. However, the inner core region contribution with low and reversed shear can drive the mode unstable. This effect of shear on the energetic ion pressure contribution is found to be consistent with the literature. These results explain the observation that the 2/1 mode was found to be damped and stabilized by energetic ions in letterf - MHD simulations of tokamak experiments with positive shear throughout, while the 2/1 mode was found to be driven unstable in simulations of experiments with weakly reversed shear in the core. This is also found to be consistent with related experimental observations of the stability of the 2/1 mode changing significantly with core shear.",17,[],5

Whereas all three modes have been separately reported before in different systems, we show they belong to a common description.

The particle aggregates initially have a string-like morphology that remain tethered at their ends to the micropillar walls, while the rest of the structure remains suspended in the fluid medium. It is this morphology that inspired us to name these structures streamers. The flow regime under which streamer formation is observed is quantified using through a phase diagram.

In large and finite populations, demographic fluctuations (internal noise) drive two species to extinction in a finite time, while the species with the smallest reproduction-predation rate is the most likely to be the surviving one (""law of the weakest""). Here, we model environmental (external) noise by assuming that the reproduction-predation rate of the ""strongest species"" (the fastest to reproduce/predate) in a given static environment randomly switches between two values corresponding to more and less favorable external conditions. We study the joint effect of environmental and demographic noise on the species survival probabilities and on the mean extinction time. In particular, we investigate whether the survival probabilities follow the law of the weakest and analyze their dependence of the external noise intensity and switching rate. Remarkably, when, on average, there is a finite number of switches prior to extinction, the survival probability of the predator of the species whose reaction rate switches typically varies non-monotonically with the external noise intensity (with optimal survival about a critical noise strength). We also outline the relationship with the case where all reaction rates switch on markedly different time scales.",17,"['cond-mat', 'nlin', 'physics']",10

Although camera-traps are convenient in application, there remain both theoretical complications such as spatial autocorrelation or false negative problem and practical difficulties, for example, laborious random sampling. In the article we propose an alternative way to bypass the mentioned problems.   In the proposed approach, the raw video information collected from the camera-traps situated at the spots of natural attraction is turned into the frequency of visits, and the latter is transformed into the desired abundance estimate. The key for such a transformation is the application of the correction coefficients, computed for each particular observation environment using the Bayesian approach and the massive database (DB) of observations under various conditions.   The main result of the article is a new method of census based on video-data from camera-traps at the spots of natural attraction and information from a special community-driven database.   The proposed method is based on automated video-capturing at a moderate number of easy to reach spots, so in the long term many laborious census works may be conducted easier, cheaper and cause less disturbance for the wild life. Information post-processing is strictly formalized, which leaves little chance for subjective alterations. However, the method heavily relies on the volume and quality of the DB, which in its turn heavily relies on the efforts of the community. There is realistic hope that the community of zoologists and environment specialists could create and maintain a DB similar to the proposed one.

Individuals may vary both in the task that they perform and in the persistence with which they perform each task. Although both the distribution of individuals among tasks and differences among individuals in behavioral persistence can each impact collective behavior, we do not know if and how they jointly affect collective outcomes. Here we use a detailed computational model to examine the joint impact of colony-level distribution among tasks and behavioral persistence of individuals, specifically their fidelity to particular resource sites, on the collective tradeoff between exploring for new resources and exploiting familiar ones. We developed an agent-based model of foraging honey bees, parameterized by data from 5 colonies, in which we simulated scouts, who search the environment for new resources, and individuals who are recruited by the scouts to the newly found resources, i.e., recruits. We found that for each value of persistence there is a different optimal ratio of scouts to recruits that maximizes resource collection by the colony. Furthermore, changes to the persistence of scouts induced opposite effects from changes to the persistence of recruits on the collective foraging of the colony. The proportion of scouts that resulted in the most resources collected by the colony decreased as the persistence of recruits increased. However, this optimal proportion of scouts increased as the persistence of scouts increased. Thus, behavioral persistence and task participation can interact to impact a colony's collective behavior in orthogonal directions. Our work provides new insights and generates new hypotheses into how variation in behavior at both the individual and colony levels jointly impact the trade-off between exploring for new resources and exploiting familiar ones.",17,[],10

1710.05494,q-bio,"The structure of human sleep changes across development as it consolidates from the polyphasic sleep of infants to the single nighttime sleep period typical in adults. Across this same developmental period, time scales of the homeostatic sleep drive, the physiological drive to sleep that increases with time spent awake, also change and presumably govern the transition from polyphasic to monophasic sleep behavior. Using a physiologically-based, sleep-wake regulatory network model for human sleep, we investigated the dynamics of wake, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM (NREM) sleep during this transition by varying the homeostatic sleep drive time constants. Previously, we introduced an algorithm for constructing a one-dimensional circle map that represents the dynamics of the full sleep-wake network model. By tracking bifurcations in the piecewise continuous circle map as the homeostatic sleep drive time constants are varied, we establish evidence for a border collision bifurcation that results in period-adding-like behavior in the number of sleep cycles per day. Interestingly, this bifurcation is preceded by bifurcations in the number of REM bouts per sleep cycle that exhibit truncated period-adding-like behavior. The interaction of these bifurcations in numbers of sleep episodes and numbers of REM bouts per sleep episode generate non-monotonic variation in sleep cycle patterns as well as quasi-periodic patterns during the transition from polyphasic to monophasic sleep behavior. This analysis may have implications for understanding changes in sleep in early childhood when preschoolers transition from napping to non-napping behavior, and the wide interindividual variation observed during this transition.",17,[],10
1705.03407,q-bio,"The recent development of single-cell transcriptomics has enabled gene expression to be measured in individual cells instead of being population-averaged. Despite this considerable precision improvement, inferring regulatory networks remains challenging because stochasticity now proves to play a fundamental role in gene expression. In particular, mRNA synthesis is now acknowledged to occur in a highly bursty manner. We propose to view the inference problem as a fitting procedure for a mechanistic gene network model that is inherently stochastic and takes not only protein, but also mRNA levels into account. We first explain how to build and simulate this network model based upon the coupling of genes that are described as piecewise-deterministic Markov processes. Our model is modular and can be used to implement various biochemical hypotheses including causal interactions between genes. However, a naive fitting procedure would be intractable. By performing a relevant approximation of the stationary distribution, we derive a tractable procedure that corresponds to a statistical hidden Markov model with interpretable parameters. This approximation turns out to be extremely close to the theoretical distribution in the case of a simple toggle-switch, and we show that it can indeed fit real single-cell data. As a first step toward inference, our approach was applied to a number of simple two-gene networks simulated in silico from the mechanistic model and satisfactorily recovered the original networks. Our results demonstrate that functional interactions between genes can be inferred from the distribution of a mechanistic, dynamical stochastic model that is able to describe gene expression in individual cells.

1702.05288,q-bio,"Heparan sulfate (HS) is a linear, polydisperse sulfated polysaccharide belonging to the glycosaminoglycan family. HS proteoglycans are ubiquitously found at the cell surface and extracellular matrix in animal species. HS is involved in the interaction with a wide variety of proteins and the regulation of many biological activities. In certain pathologic conditions, expression and shedding of HS proteoglycans is overregulated, or enzymatic degradation of HS in lysosomes is deficient, both leading to excess circulating free HS chains in blood plasma. HS has therefore been suggested as a biomarker for various severe disease states. The structural heterogeneity makes the quantification of heparan sulfate in complex matrices such as human plasma challenging. HS plasma levels are usually quantified by either disaccharide analysis or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA). Both methods require time-consuming multistep-protocols. We describe here the instant detection of heparan sulfate in spiked plasma samples by the Heparin Red Kit, a commercial mix-and-read fluorescence microplate assay.

In this work, we demonstrate some new types of wave propagation and pattern formation in a classical three species cyclic competition model with spatial diffusion, which have been so far missed in the literature. These new patterns are characterised by a high regularity in space, but are different from patterns previously known to exist in reaction-diffusion models, and may have important applications in improving our understanding of biological pattern formation and invasion theory. Finding these new patterns is made technically possible by using an automatic adaptive finite element method driven by a novel a posteriori error estimate which is proven to provide a reliable bound for the error of the numerical method. We demonstrate how this numerical framework allows us to easily explore the dynamical patterns both in two and three spatial dimensions.",17,['math'],10
1703.00895,q-bio,"Aim: To evaluate a flow cytometry protocol that uses reference beads for the enumeration of live and dead bacteria present in a mixture. Methods and Results: Mixtures of live and dead Escherichia coli with live:dead concentration ratios varying from 0 to 100% were prepared. These samples were stained using SYTO 9 and propidium iodide and 6 letterm reference beads were added. Bacteria present in live samples were enumerated by agar plate counting. Bacteria present in dead samples were enumerated by agar plate counting before treatment with isopropanol. There is a linear relationship between the presented flow cytometry method and agar plate counts for live (R2 = 0.99) and dead E. coli (R2 = 0.93) concentrations of ca. 104 to 108 bacteria ml-1 within mixtures of live and dead bacteria. Conclusions: Reliable enumeration of live E. coli within a mixture of both live and dead was possible for concentration ratios of above 2.5% live and for the enumeration of dead E. coli the lower limit was ca. 20% dead. Significance and Impact of the Study: The ability to obtain absolute cell concentrations is only available for selected flow cytometers, this study describes a method for accurate enumeration that is applicable to basic flow cytometers without specialised counting features. By demonstrating the application of the method to count E. coli, we raised points of consideration for using this FCM counting method and aim to lay the foundation for future work that uses similar methods for different bacterial strains.",17,['physics'],10
1701.04782,q-bio,The brain is a paradigmatic example of a complex system as its functionality emerges as a global property of local mesoscopic and microscopic interactions. Complex network theory allows to elicit the functional architecture of the brain in terms of links (correlations) between nodes (grey matter regions) and to extract information out of the noise. Here we present the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data from forty healthy humans during the resting condition for the investigation of the basal scaffold of the functional brain network organization. We show how brain regions tend to coordinate by forming a highly hierarchical chain-like structure of homogeneously clustered anatomical areas. A maximum spanning tree approach revealed the centrality of the occipital cortex and the peculiar aggregation of cerebellar regions to form a closed core. We also report the hierarchy of network segregation and the level of clusters integration as a function of the connectivity strength between brain regions.,17,"['physics', 'stat']",10

1707.06569,q-bio,"The size structure of fish-communities is an emergent high-level property of marine food webs responsive to changes in structure and function. To measure this food web property using data arising from routine fisheries surveys, a simple metric known as Typical Length has been proposed as more suitable than the Large Fish Indicator, which has been highly engineered to be responsive to fishing pressure. Typical Length avoids the inherent dependence of the Large Fish Indicator on a parameter that requires case-by-case adjustments. Using IBTS survey time series for five spatial subdivisions of the Greater North Sea, we show that the Typical Length can provide information equivalent to the Large Fish Indicator when fishing is likely the strongest driver, but differences can also arise. In this example, Typical Length exhibits smaller random fluctuations (""noise"") than the Large Fish Indicator. Typical Length is also more adaptable than the Large Fish Indicator and can be easily applied to monitor pelagic fish in addition to demersal fish, and together with information on the potential growth of the fish community, a proxy of which can be derived from the Mean Maximum Length indicator, it is possible to partition change in community composition from change in size structure. This suggests that Typical Length is an improvement over the Large Fish Indicator as a food web indicator with the potential to offer further insight when considered in conjunction with indicators of community composition.",17,[],10
1705.10516,q-bio,"We introduce an Interaction and Trade-off based Eco-Evolutionary Model (ITEEM), in which species are competing for common resources in a well-mixed system, and their evolution in interaction trait space is subject to a life-history trade-off between replication rate and competitive ability. We demonstrate that the strength of the trade-off has a fundamental impact on eco-evolutionary dynamics, as it imposes four phases of diversity, including a sharp phase transition. Despite its minimalism, ITEEM produces without further ad hoc features a remarkable range of observed patterns of eco-evolutionary dynamics. Most notably we find self-organization towards structured communities with high and sustainable diversity, in which competing species form interaction cycles similar to rock-paper-scissors games.",17,[],10
1711.04266,q-bio,"Do biological cells sense time by the number of their divisions, a process that ends at senescence? We consider the question ""can the cell's perception of time be expressed through the length of the shortest telomere?"" The answer is that the absolute time before senescence cannot be expressed by the telomere's length and that a cell can survive many more divisions than intuitively expected. This apparent paradox is due to shortening and elongation of the telomere, which suggests a random walk model of the telomere's length. The model indicates two phases, first, a determinist drift of the length toward a quasi-equilibrium state, and second, persistence of the length near an attracting state for the majority of divisions prior to senescence. The measure of stability of the latter phase is the expected number of divisions at the attractor (""lifetime"") prior to crossing a threshold to senescence. The telomerase regulates stability by creating an effective potential barrier that separates statistically the shortest lifetime from the next shortest. The random walk has to overcome the barrier in order to extend the range of the first regime. The model explains how random telomere dynamics underlies the extension of cell survival time.",17,['math'],10
1701.05503,q-bio,"Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are key molecular determinants of T cell fate and effector function. A number of inflammatory diseases are characterized by an altered balance of T cell phenotypes and cytokine secretion. STATs, therefore, represent viable therapeutic targets in numerous pathologies. However, the underlying mechanisms of how the same STAT proteins regulate both the development of different T cell phenotypes and their plasticity during changes in extracellular conditions remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the STAT mediated regulation of T cell phenotype formation and plasticity using mathematical modeling and experimental data for intracellular STAT signaling proteins. The close fit of our model predictions to the experimental data for IFN-letter to IL-10 switching allows us to propose a potential mechanism for T cell switching that regulates human Th1/Tr1 responses. According to this mechanism, T cell phenotype switching is due to the relative redistribution of STAT dimer complexes caused by the extracellular cytokine-dependent STAT competition effects. The proposed model is applicable to a number of STAT signaling circuits.",17,[],10
1705.05919,q-bio,"A large number of protein sequences are becoming available through the application of novel high-throughput sequencing technologies. Experimental functional characterization of these proteins is time-consuming and expensive, and is often only done rigorously for few selected model organisms. Computational function prediction approaches have been suggested to fill this gap. The functions of proteins are classified using the Gene Ontology (GO), which contains over 40,000 classes. Additionally, proteins have multiple functions, making function prediction a large-scale, multi-class, multi-label problem.   We have developed a novel method to predict protein function from sequence. We use deep learning to learn features from protein sequences as well as a cross-species protein-protein interaction network. Our approach specifically outputs information in the structure of the GO and utilizes the dependencies between GO classes as background information to construct a deep learning model.

1706.03920,q-bio,"In species reproducing both sexually and asexually clones are often more common in recently established populations. Earlier studies have suggested that this pattern arises from natural selection favouring asexual recruitment in young populations. Alternatively, as we show here, this pattern may result from stochastic processes during species-range expansions. We model a dioecious species expanding into a new area in which all individuals are capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction, and all individuals have equal survival rates and dispersal distances. Even under conditions that eventually favour sexual recruitment, colonisation starts with an asexual wave. Long after colonisation is completed, a sexual wave erodes clonal dominance. If individuals reproduce more than one season, and with only local dispersal, a few large clones typically dominate for thousands of reproductive seasons. Adding occasional long-distance dispersal, more dominant clones emerge, but they persist for a shorter period of time. The general mechanism involved is simple: edge effects at the expansion front favour asexual (uniparental) recruitment where potential mates are rare. Specifically, our stochastic model makes detailed predictions different from a selection model, and comparing these with empirical data from a postglacially established seaweed species (Fucus radicans) shows that in this case a stochastic mechanism is strongly supported.",17,[],10
1703.10929,q-bio,"During tissue invasion individual tumor cells exhibit two interconvertible migration modes, namely mesenchymal and amoeboid migration. The cellular microenvironment triggers the switch between both modes, thereby allowing adaptation to dynamic conditions. It is, however, unclear if this amoeboid-mesenchymal migration plasticity contributes to a more effective tumor invasion. We address this question with a mathematical model, where the amoeboid-mesenchymal migration plasticity is regulated in response to local extracellular matrix resistance. Our numerical analysis reveals that extracellular matrix structure and presence of a chemotactic gradient are key determinants of the model behavior. Only in complex microenvironments, if the extracellular matrix is highly heterogeneous and a chemotactic gradient directs migration, the amoeboid-mesenchymal migration plasticity allows a more widespread invasion compared to the non-switching amoeboid and mesenchymal modes. Importantly, these specific conditions are characteristic for in vivo tumor invasion. Thus, our study suggests that \emphin vitro systems aiming at unraveling the underlying molecular mechanisms of tumor invasion should take into account the complexity of the microenvironment by considering the combined effects of structural heterogeneities and chemical gradients on cell migration.",17,[],10
1710.04056,q-bio,"The properties of functional brain networks strongly depend on how their nodes are chosen. Commonly, nodes are defined by Regions of Interest (ROIs), pre-determined groupings of fMRI measurement voxels. Earlier, we have demonstrated that the functional homogeneity of ROIs, captured by their spatial consistency, varies widely across ROIs in commonly-used brain atlases. Here, we ask how ROIs behave as nodes of dynamic brain networks. To this end, we use two measures: spatiotemporal consistency measures changes in spatial consistency across time and network turnover quantifies the changes in the local network structure around a ROI. We find that spatial consistency varies non-uniformly in space and time, which is reflected in the variation of spatiotemporal consistency across ROIs. Further, we see time-dependent changes in the network neighborhoods of the ROIs, reflected in high network turnover. Network turnover is nonuniformly distributed across ROIs: ROIs with high spatiotemporal consistency have low network turnover. Finally, we reveal that there is rich voxel-level correlation structure inside ROIs. Because the internal structure and the connectivity of ROIs vary in time, the common approach of using static node definitions may be surprisingly inaccurate. Therefore, network neuroscience would greatly benefit from node definition strategies tailored for dynamical networks.",17,[],10
1706.05831,q-bio,"We propose an alternative to the prevailing two origin of life narratives, one based on a replicator first hypothesis, and one based on a metabolism first hypothesis. Both hypotheses have known difficulties: All known evolvable molecular replicators such as RNA require complex chemical (enzymatic) machinery for the replication process. Likewise, contemporary cellular metabolisms require several enzymatically catalyzed steps, and it is difficult to identify a non-enzymatic path to their realization. We propose that there must have been precursors to both replication and metabolism that enable a form of selection to take place through action of simple chemical and physical processes. We model a concrete example of such a process, repeated sequestration of binary molecular combinations after exposure to an environment with a broad distribution of chemical components, as might be realized experimentally in in a repeated wet-dry cycle. We show that the repeated sequestration dynamics results in a selective amplification of a very small subset of molecular species present in the environment, thus providing a candidate primordial selection process.",17,[],10

1705.08669,q-bio,"Biochemical networks play a crucial role in biological systems, implementing a broad range of vital functions. They normally operate at low copy numbers and in spatial settings, but this is often ignored and well-stirred conditions are assumed. Yet, it is increasingly becoming clear that even microscopic spatial inhomogeneities oftentimes can induce significant differences on the macroscopic level. Since experimental observation of single-molecule behavior is extremely challenging, theoretical modeling of biochemical reactions on the single-particle level is an important tool for understanding spatial effects in biochemical systems. While purely analytical models quickly become intractable here, spatial-stochastic simulations can capture a wide range of biochemical processes with the necessary levels of detail. Here we discuss different techniques for spatial-stochastic simulation of reaction-diffusion systems, and explain important precautions required to make them biochemically accurate and efficient. We illustrate non-negligible accuracy issues arising even in the most simple approaches to biochemical simulation, and present methods to deal with them. We first explain how Brownian Dynamics, a widely used particle-based diffusion simulation technique with fixed propagation time, can be adapted to incorporate chemical reactions, and portray a range of schemes that elaborate on this idea. We then introduce event-driven spatial-stochastic simulation methods, in which system updates are performed asynchronously with situation-dependent, varying time steps; here we particularly focus on eGFRD, a computationally efficient particle-based algorithm that makes use of analytical functions to accurately sample interparticle reactions and diffusive motion with large jumps in time and space.

1710.06593,q-bio,"Tumors of the eye and nervous system often exhibit an arch-like arrangement of nuclei, called rosettes. Pathologists are able to identify rosettes [full circles] and the presence of partial rosettes [semi-circles] and interpret this as a sign of differentiation in a tumor.

This paper proposes a mathematical algorithm to computationally detect the presence of obvious or non-obvious partial rosettes, henceforth referred to as Nguyen-Wu Partial Rosettes. Quantifying the degree of partial rosettes present in a tumor may allow pathologists to stratify tumors into more refined groups that may respond better to therapy or have different clinical outcomes. The Midline Cross Product [MCP] algorithm calculates the magnitude of two cross products and adds them together to obtain one value. Each of the two cross products results from [1] the line that connects the midpoints of longest lengths of two neighboring ovals, and [2] the line that extends from the midpoint from one longest length and is perpendicular to that longest length.

It causes reduction of cultivable area and combined with other factors, presents a serious threat to food stability in these areas. Context: In front of this problem, the selection of salt tolerant species and varieties remains the best economic approach for exploitation and rehabilitation of salt-affected regions. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the seed germination response of six Acacia species under different NaCl concentrations in order to explore opportunities for selection and breeding salt tolerant genotypes. Methods: The salinity effect was examined by measuring some agro-morphological parameters in controlled growth environment using five treatment levels: 0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mM of NaCl. Results: The analyzed data revealed significant variability in salt response within and between species. All growth parameters were progressively reduced by increased NaCl concentrations. Growth in height, leaf number and total plant dry weight were considered as the most sensitive parameters. However, the growth reduction varied among species in accordance with their tolerance level. It is important to note that all species survived at the highest salinity (400 mM). Whereas A. horrida and A. raddiana were proved to be often the best tolerant, they recorded the lowest reduction percentage at this stage.

1703.08950,q-bio,"Gene tree/species tree reconciliation is a recent decisive progress in phylo-genetic methods, accounting for the possible differences between gene histories and species histories. Reconciliation consists in explaining these differences by gene-scale events such as duplication, loss, transfer, which translates mathematically into a mapping between gene tree nodes and species tree nodes or branches. Gene conversion is a very frequent biological event, which results in the replacement of a gene by a copy of another from the same species and in the same gene tree. Including this event in reconciliations has never been attempted because this changes as well the solutions as the methods to construct reconciliations. Standard algorithms based on dynamic programming become ineffective. We propose here a novel mathematical framework including gene conversion as an evolutionary event in gene tree/species tree reconciliation. We describe a randomized algorithm giving in polynomial running time a reconciliation minimizing the number of duplications, losses and conversions. We show that the space of reconciliations includes an analog of the Last Common Ancestor reconciliation, but is not limited to it. Our algorithm outputs any optimal reconciliation with non null probability.

1711.07162,q-bio,"Wound healing assays are commonly used to study how populations of cells, initialised on a two-dimensional surface, act to close an artificial wound space. While real wounds have different shapes, standard wound healing assays often deal with just one simple wound shape, and it is unclear whether varying the wound shape might impact how we interpret results from these experiments. In this work, we describe a new kind of wound healing assay, called a sticker assay, that allows us to examine the role of wound shape in a series of wound healing assays performed with fibroblast cells. In particular, we show how to use the sticker assay to examine wound healing with square, circular and triangular shaped wounds. We take a standard approach and report measurements of the size of the wound as a function of time. This shows that the rate of wound closure depends on the initial wound shape. This result is interesting because the only aspect of the assay that we change is the initial wound shape, and the reason for the different rate of wound closure is unclear. To provide more insight into the experimental observations we describe our results quantitatively by calibrating a mathematical model, describing the relevant transport phenomena, to match our experimental data. Overall, our results suggest that the rates of cell motility and cell proliferation from different initial wound shapes are approximately the same, implying that the differences we observe in the wound closure rate are consistent with a fairly typical mathematical model of wound healing. Our results imply that parameter estimates obtained from an experiment performed with one particular wound shape could be used to describe an experiment performed with a different shape.

We adapt a Hybrid Extended Kalman Filtering technique by updating the process noise covariance at each time step based on estimates. We compare the performance of this framework with different fixed values of process noise covariance in biomolecular system models, including an oscillator model, as well as in experimentally measured data for a negative transcriptional feedback circuit. We find that the Extended Kalman Filter with such process noise covariance update is closer to the optimality condition in the sense that the innovation sequence becomes white and in achieving a balance between the mean square estimation error and parameter convergence time. The results of this chapter may help in the use of Extended Kalman Filters for systems where process noise covariance depends on states and/or parameters.",17,['stat'],10

The effects of instrument-specific musical training on auditory grouping in the context of stream segregation are investigated here in three experiments. In Experiment 1a, participants listened to sequences of ABA tones and indicated when they heard a change in rhythm. This change is caused by the manipulation of the B tones' timbre and indexes a change in perception from integration to segregation, or vice versa. While it was expected that musicians would detect a change in rhythm earlier when their own instrument was involved, no such pattern was observed. In Experiment 1b, designed to control for potential expectation effects in Experiment 1a, participants heard sequences of static ABA tones and reported their initial perceptions, whether the sequence was integrated or segregated. Results show that participants tend to initially perceive these static sequences as segregated, and that perception is influenced by similarity between the timbres involved. Finally, in Experiment 2 violinists and flautists located mistuned notes in an interleaved melody paradigm containing a violin and a flute melody. Performance did not depend on the instrument the participant played but rather which melody their attention was directed to.

1710.05201,q-bio,"The balance between excitation and inhibition is crucial for neuronal computation. It is observed that the balanced state of neuronal networks exists in many experiments, yet its underlying mechanism remains to be fully clarified. Theoretical studies of the balanced state mainly focus on the analysis of the homogeneous Erdequations-R\'enyi network. However, neuronal networks have been found to be inhomogeneous in many cortical areas. In particular, the connectivity of neuronal networks can be of the type of scale-free, small-world, or even with specific motifs. In this work, we examine the questions of whether the balanced state is universal with respect to network topology and what characteristics the balanced state possesses in inhomogeneous networks such as scale-free and small-world networks. We discover that, for a sparsely but strongly connected inhomogeneous network, despite that the whole network receives external inputs, there is a small active subnetwork (active core) inherently embedded within it. The neurons in this active core have relatively high firing rates while the neurons in the rest of the network are quiescent. Surprisingly, the active core possesses a balanced state and this state is independent of the model of single-neuron dynamics. The dynamics of the active core can be well predicted using the Fokker-Planck equation with the mean-field assumption. Our results suggest that, in the presence of inhomogeneous network connectivity, the balanced state may be ubiquitous in the brain, and the network connectivity in the active core is essentially close to the Erdequations-R\'enyi structure. The existence of the small active core embedded in a large network may provide a potential dynamical scenario underlying sparse coding in neuronal networks.",17,[],10

However, pathway analysis research is still in its infancy, especially when applying it to solve practical problems.   In this paper we propose a new method of studying biological pathways, one that cross analyzes mutation information, transcriptome and proteomics data. Using this outcome, we identify routes of aberrant pathways potentially responsible for the etiology of disease.

1707.04862,q-bio,"The most frequent form of pairwise synthetic lethality (SL) in metabolic networks is known as plasticity synthetic lethality (PSL). It occurs when the simultaneous inhibition of paired functional and silent metabolic reactions or genes is lethal, while the default of the functional reaction or gene in the pair is backed up by the activation of the silent one. Based on a complex systems approach and by using computational techniques on bacterial genome-scale metabolic reconstructions, we found that the failure of the functional PSL partner triggers a critical reorganization of fluxes to ensure viability in the mutant which not only affects the SL pair but a significant fraction of other interconnected reactions forming what we call a SL cluster. Interestingly, SL clusters show a strong entanglement both in terms of silent coessential reactions, which band together to form backup systems, and of other functional and silent reactions in the metabolic network. This strong overlap, also detected at the level of genes, mitigates the acquired vulnerabilities and increased structural and functional costs that pay for the robustness provided by essential plasticity. Finally, the participation of coessential reactions and genes in different SL clusters is very heterogeneous and those at the intersection of many SL clusters could serve as supertargets for more efficient drug action in the treatment of complex diseases and to elucidate improved strategies directed to reduce undesired resistance to chemicals in pathogens.",17,"['cond-mat', 'physics']",10

1711.00989,q-bio,"The Naequation/Kequation ATPase is an essential component of cardiac electrophysiology, maintaining physiological Naequation and Kequation concentrations over successive heart beats. Terkildsen et al. (2007) developed a model of the ventricular myocyte Naequation/Kequation ATPase to study extracellular potassium accumulation during ischaemia, demonstrating the ability to recapitulate a wide range of experimental data, but unfortunately there was no archived code associated with the original manuscript. Here we detail an updated version of the model and provide CellML and MATLAB code to ensure reproducibility and reusability. We note some errors within the original formulation which have been corrected to ensure that the model is thermodynamically consistent, and although this required some reparameterisation, the resulting model still provides a good fit to experimental measurements that demonstrate the dependence of Naequation/Kequation ATPase pumping rate upon membrane voltage and metabolite concentrations. To demonstrate thermodynamic consistency we also developed a bond graph version of the model.

1704.02780,q-bio,"Message passing between components of a distributed physical system is non-instantaneous and contributes to determine the time scales of the emerging collective dynamics like an effective inertia. In biological neuron networks this inertia is due in part to local synaptic filtering of exchanged spikes, and in part to the distribution of the axonal transmission delays. How differently these two kinds of inertia affect the network dynamics is an open issue not yet addressed due to the difficulties in dealing with the non-Markovian nature of synaptic transmission. Here, we develop a mean-field dimensional reduction yielding to an effective Markovian dynamics of the population density of the neuronal membrane potential, valid under the hypothesis of small fluctuations of the synaptic current. The resulting theory allows us to prove the formal equivalence between local and distributed inertia, holding for any synaptic time scale, integrate-and-fire neuron model, spike emission regimes and for different network states even when the neuron number is finite.",17,['cond-mat'],10
1706.05702,q-bio,"Spiking neuronal networks are usually simulated with three main simulation schemes: the classical time-driven and event-driven schemes, and the more recent hybrid scheme. All three schemes evolve the state of a neuron through a series of checkpoints: equally spaced in the first scheme and determined neuron-wise by spike events in the latter two. The time-driven and the hybrid scheme determine whether the membrane potential of a neuron crosses a threshold at the end of of the time interval between consecutive checkpoints. Threshold crossing can, however, occur within the interval even if this test is negative. Spikes can therefore be missed. The present work derives, implements, and benchmarks a method for perfect retrospective spike detection. This method can be applied to neuron models with affine or linear subthreshold dynamics. The idea behind the method is to propagate the threshold with a time-inverted dynamics, testing whether the threshold crosses the neuron state to be evolved, rather than vice versa. Algebraically this translates into a set of inequalities necessary and sufficient for threshold crossing. This test is slower than the imperfect one, but faster than an alternative perfect tests based on bisection or root-finding methods. Comparison confirms earlier results that the imperfect test rarely misses spikes (less than a fraction equation of missed spikes) in biologically relevant settings. This study offers an alternative geometric point of view on neuronal dynamics.",17,"['math', 'physics']",10

We argue that entanglement enhances the thermodynamic stability of the system but it may have other functions: burying the hydrophobic residues at the interface, and increasing the DNA or RNA binding area. We also study the folding and stretching properties of the knotted dimeric proteins MJ0366, YibK and bacteriophytochrome.

1701.08404,q-bio,"Motivation: Cellular Electron CryoTomography (CECT) enables 3D visualization of cellular organization at near-native state and in sub-molecular resolution, making it a powerful tool for analyzing structures of macromolecular complexes and their spatial organizations inside single cells. However, high degree of structural complexity together with practical imaging limitations make the systematic de novo discovery of structures within cells challenging. It would likely require averaging and classifying millions of subtomograms potentially containing hundreds of highly heterogeneous structural classes. Although it is no longer difficult to acquire CECT data containing such amount of subtomograms due to advances in data acquisition automation, existing computational approaches have very limited scalability or discrimination ability, making them incapable of processing such amount of data.   Results: To complement existing approaches, in this paper we propose a new approach for subdividing subtomograms into smaller but relatively homogeneous subsets. The structures in these subsets can then be separately recovered using existing computation intensive methods. Our approach is based on supervised structural feature extraction using deep learning, in combination with unsupervised clustering and reference-free classification. Our experiments show that, compared to existing unsupervised rotation invariant feature and pose-normalization based approaches, our new approach achieves significant improvements in both discrimination ability and scalability. More importantly, our new approach is able to discover new structural classes and recover structures that do not exist in training data.",17,[],10
1708.03499,q-bio,"The shape of allele-frequency clines maintained by migration-selection balance depends not only on the properties of migration and selection, but also on the dominance relations among alleles and on linkage to other loci under selection. We investigate a two-locus model in which two diallelic, recombining loci are subject to selection caused by an abrupt environmental change. The habitat is one-dimensional and unbounded, selection at each locus is modeled by step functions such that in one region one allele at each locus is advantageous and in the other deleterious. We admit an environmentally independent, intermediate degree of dominance at both loci, including complete dominance. First, we derive an explicit expression for the single-locus cline with dominance, thus generalizing classical results by Haldane (1948). We show that the slope of the cline in the center (at the step) or, equivalently, the width of the cline, is independent of the degree of dominance. Second, under the assumption of strong recombination relative to selection and migration, the first-order approximations of the allele-frequency clines at each of the loci and of the linkage disequilibrium are derived. This may be interpreted as the quasi-linkage-equilibrium approximation of the two-locus cline. Explicit asymptotic expressions for the clines are deduced as equation. For equivalent loci, explicit expressions for the whole clines are derived. The influence of dominance and of linkage on the slope of the cline in the center and on a global measure of steepness are investigated. This global measure reflects the influence of dominance. Finally, the accuracy of the approximations and the dependence of the shape of the two-locus cline on the full range of recombination rates is explored by numerical integration of the underlying system of partial differential equations.",17,['math'],10
1711.05517,q-bio,"Developmental dyslexia is characterized by persistent reading and spelling deficits. Partly due to technical challenges with investigating subcortical sensory structures, current research on dyslexia in humans by-and-large focuses on the cerebral cortex. These studies found that dyslexia is typically associated with functional and structural alterations of a distributed left-hemispheric cerebral cortex network. However, findings from animal models and post-mortem studies in humans suggest that developmental dyslexia might also be associated with structural alterations in subcortical sensory pathways. Whether these alterations also exist in developmental dyslexia in-vivo and how they relate to dyslexia symptoms is currently unknown. Here we used ultra-high resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI and probabilistic tractography to investigate the structural connections of the visual sensory pathway in dyslexia in-vivo. We discovered that individuals with developmental dyslexia have reduced structural connections in the direct pathway between the left visual thalamus (LGN) and left middle temporal area V5/MT, but not between the left LGN and left primary visual cortex (V1). In addition, left V5/MT-LGN connectivity strength correlated with rapid naming abilities - a key deficit in dyslexia [14]. These findings provide the first evidence of specific structural alterations in the connections between the sensory thalamus and cortex in developmental dyslexia. The results challenge current standard models and provide novel evidence for the importance of cortico-thalamic interactions in explaining dyslexia.",17,[],10
1708.02667,q-bio,"Due to the asymmetric nature of the nucleotides, the extant informational biomolecule, DNA, is constrained to replicate unidirectionally on a template. As a product of molecular evolution that sought to maximize replicative potential, DNA's unidirectional replication poses a mystery since symmetric bidirectional self-replicators obviously would replicate faster than unidirectional self-replicators and hence would have been evolutionarily more successful. Here we carefully examine the physico-chemical requirements for evolutionarily successful primordial self-replicators and theoretically show that at low monomer concentrations that possibly prevailed in the primordial oceans, asymmetric unidirectional self-replicators would have an evolutionary advantage over bidirectional self-replicators. The competing requirements of low and high kinetic barriers for formation and long lifetime of inter-strand bonds respectively are simultaneously satisfied through asymmetric kinetic influence of inter-strand bonds, resulting in evolutionarily successful unidirectional self-replicators.",17,[],10

Therefore, the second region is a ""buffer zone"" between the two extremal regions. We study the basic reproductive ratio as a function of the vaccination in all regions and migration among them. This problem is studied numerically, showing explicit situations in which migration will have an overall positive effect in the disease dynamics, with and without vaccinations.

1706.05452,q-bio,"The biomechanics of the human body gives subjects a high degree of freedom in how they can execute movement. Nevertheless, subjects exhibit regularity in their movement patterns.

We adopt the principle that human movements are optimal and develop a general model for human movement patters that uses variational methods in the form of optimal control theory to calculate trajectories of movement trajectories of the body. We find that in this approach a constant of the motion that arises from the model and which plays a role in the optimal control model that is analogous to the role that the mechanical energy plays in classical physics. We illustrate how this approach works in practice by using it to develop a model of walking gait, making all the derivations and calculations in detail.

In this study, a set of difference equations simplifying the complex interaction between vectors and their hosts (competent and not for Borrelia) is built to gain insights into conditions underlying the dominance of B. lusitaniae (transmitted by lizards to susceptible ticks) and the maintenance of B. afzelii (transmitted by wild rodents) observed in a study area in Tuscany, Italy.

1706.08041,q-bio,"Subcortical structures play a critical role in brain function. However, options for assessing electrophysiological activity in these structures are limited. Electromagnetic fields generated by neuronal activity in subcortical structures can be recorded non-invasively using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). However, these subcortical signals are much weaker than those due to cortical activity. In addition, we show here that it is difficult to resolve subcortical sources, because distributed cortical activity can explain the MEG and EEG patterns due to deep sources. We then demonstrate that if the cortical activity can be assumed to be spatially sparse, both cortical and subcortical sources can be resolved with M/EEG. Building on this insight, we develop a novel hierarchical sparse inverse solution for M/EEG. We assess the performance of this algorithm on realistic simulations and auditory evoked response data and show that thalamic and brainstem sources can be correctly estimated in the presence of cortical activity.

It incorporates the Stariolo-Tsallis generalization of the Boltzmann Machine in order to model memory retrieval and associativity. In the present work, we define and measure avalanche size distributions during memory retrieval, in order to gain insight regarding basic aspects of the functioning of these complex networks. The avalanche sizes defined for our model should be related to the time consumed and also to the size of the neuronal region which is activated, during memory retrieval. This allows the qualitative comparison of the behaviour of the distribution of cluster sizes, obtained during fMRI measurements of the propagation of signals in the brain, with the distribution of avalanche sizes obtained in our simulation experiments.

1708.07612,q-bio,"In the protein sequence space, natural proteins form clusters of families which are characterized by their unique native folds whereas the great majority of random polypeptides are neither clustered nor foldable to unique structures. Since a given polypeptide can be either foldable or unfoldable, a kind of ""folding transition"" is expected at the boundary of a protein family in the sequence space. By Monte Carlo simulations of a statistical mechanical model of protein sequence alignment that coherently incorporates both short-range and long-range interactions as well as variable-length insertions to reproduce the statistics of the multiple sequence alignment of a given protein family, we demonstrate the existence of such transition between natural-like sequences and random sequences in the sequence subspaces for 15 domain families of various folds. The transition was found to be highly cooperative and two-state-like. Furthermore, enforcing or suppressing consensus residues on a few of the well-conserved sites enhanced or diminished, respectively, the natural-like pattern formation over the entire sequence. In most families, the key sites included ligand binding sites. These results suggest some selective pressure on the key residues, such as ligand binding activity, may cooperatively facilitate the emergence of a protein family during evolution.

1708.09462,q-bio,"We will study a mathematical model of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the presence of combination therapy that includes within-host infectious dynamics. The deterministic model requires us to analyze asymptotic stability of two distinct steady states, disease-free and endemic equilibria. Previous results have focused on investigating the global asymptotic stability of the trivial steady state using an implicit finite-difference method which generates a system of difference equations. We, instead, provide analytic solutions and long term attractive behavior for the endemic steady state using the theory of difference equations. The dynamics of estimated model is appropriately determined by a certain quantity threshold maintaining the immune response to a sufficient level. The result also indicates that a forward bifurcation in the model happens when the disease-free equilibrium loses its stability and a stable endemic equilibrium appears as the basic reproduction number exceeds unity. In this scenario, the classical requirement of the reproduction number being less than unity becomes a necessary and sufficient condition for disease mitigation. When the associated reproduction number is in excess of unity, a stable endemic equilibrium emerges with an unstable disease-free equilibrium (leading to the persistence and existence of HIV within the infected individuals). The attractivity of the model reveals that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under certain assumptions. A comparison between the continuous and estimated discrete models is also provided to have a clear perception in understanding the behavioral dynamics of disease modelling. Finally, we show that the associated estimation method is very robust in the sense of numerical stability since the equilibria and the stability conditions are independent of the time step.",17,['math'],10

We introduce a variant of the Wigner's friend experiment in which a multiparticle quantum system is observed by the friend. The friend undergoes rapid decoherence through her interactions with the environment. In the usual version of this thought experiment, decoherence removes the need for Wigner to treat her as a quantum system.

Importantly, we show that the friend is indispensable for the entanglement to be observed. Hence Wigner is compelled to treat the friend as part of a larger quantum system.

1712.00827,quant-ph,"A bipartite quantum interaction corresponds to the most general quantum interaction that can occur between two quantum systems in the presence of a bath. In this work, we determine bounds on the capacities of bipartite interactions for entanglement generation and secret key agreement between two quantum systems. Our upper bound on the entanglement generation capacity of a bipartite quantum interaction is given by a quantity called the bidirectional max-Rains information. Our upper bound on the secret-key-agreement capacity of a bipartite quantum interaction is given by a related quantity called the bidirectional max-relative entropy of entanglement. We also derive tighter upper bounds on the capacities of bipartite interactions obeying certain symmetries. Observing that reading of a memory device is a particular kind of bipartite quantum interaction, we leverage our bounds from the bidirectional setting to deliver bounds on the capacity of a task that we introduce, called private reading of a wiretap memory cell. Given a set of point-to-point quantum wiretap channels, the goal of private reading is for an encoder to form codewords from these channels, in order to establish secret key with a party who controls one input and one output of the channels, while a passive eavesdropper has access to one output of the channels. We derive both lower and upper bounds on the private reading capacities of a wiretap memory cell. We then extend these results to determine achievable rates for the generation of entanglement between two distant parties who have coherent access to a controlled point-to-point channel, which is a particular kind of bipartite interaction.",17,"['cond-mat', 'cs', 'math']",6

We show that, for modest heterodyne beat frequencies (equation), judicious construction of the autocorrelation of the measured current can either recover (i) a spectrum with strong sidebands but without an imprecision noise floor (ii) a spectrum which is a hybrid, combining both homodyne and heterodyne sideband features. We simulate an experimental realisation with stochastic numerics and find excellent agreement with analytical quantum noise spectra.

We show that the amount of steady-state entanglement can be enhanced by the presence of a third thermal reservoir which is common to both qubits. Specifically, we find that entanglement can be enhanced as long as the temperature of the common reservoir is below the thermalisation temperature of the qubits, whenever a single temperature can be assigned to the steady state of the qubits in the absence of the common reservoir. Moreover, the amount of entanglement generated with the common reservoir present can be significantly larger than that which can be obtained without it for any temperature of the individual reservoirs. From the perspective of thermodynamics, we find that enhancement of entanglement is associated with heat absorption by the common reservoir.

We employ the explicit form of the MPS to calculate expectation values and two-site correlation functions of local observables, and we use the results to study fluctuations of collective observables. Through the so-called macroscopicity and the squeezing properties of the collective spin variables they witness the quantum correlations and multi-particle entanglement within the chain.

Separable states are known to admit nonclassical correlations as well, which are captured by quantum discord and related measures.

Different from previous theoretical predictions, which were based on an optomechanical system's time-independent steady states, we treat such cooling as a dynamical process of driving the mechanical oscillator from its initial thermal state, due to its thermal equilibrium with the environment, to a stabilized quantum state of higher purity. We find that the stabilized thermal phonon number left in the end actually depends on how fast the cooling process could be. The cooling speed is decided by an effective optomechanical coupling intensity, which constitutes an essential parameter for cooling, in addition to the sideband resolution parameter that has been considered in other theoretical studies. The limiting thermal phonon number that any cooling process cannot surpass exhibits a discontinuous jump across a certain value of the parameter.",17,[],6

1704.06695,quant-ph,"Quantum information has been drawing a wealth of research in recent years, shedding light on questions at the heart of quantum mechanics, as well as advancing fields such as complexity theory, cryptography, key distribution, and chemistry. These fundamental and applied aspects of quantum information rely on a crucial issue: the ability to characterize a quantum state from measurements, through a process called Quantum State Tomography (QST). However, QST requires a large number of measurements, each derived from a different physical observable corresponding to a different experimental setup. Unfortunately, changing the setup results in unwanted changes to the data, prolongs the measurement and impairs the assumptions that are always made about the stationarity of the noise. Here, we propose to overcome these drawbacks by performing QST with a single observable. A single observable can often be realized by a single setup, thus considerably reducing the experimental effort. In general, measurements of a single observable do not hold enough information to recover the quantum state. We overcome this lack of information by relying on concepts inspired by Compressed Sensing (CS), exploiting the fact that the sought state - in many applications of quantum information - is close to a pure state (and thus has low rank). Additionally, we increase the system dimension by adding an ancilla that couples to information evolving in the system, thereby providing more measurements, enabling the recovery of the original quantum state from a single-observable measurements. We demonstrate our approach on multi-photon states by recovering structured quantum states from a single observable, in a single experimental setup. We further show how this approach can be used to recover quantum states without number-resolving detectors.",17,[],6

There exist situations where the correlations enable collaborative tasks that are impossible within the classical formalism. Here, we consider the efficiency of quantum computation protocols compared to classical ones as a benchmark for separating quantum and classical resources and argue that the computational advantage of collaborative quantum protocols in the discrete variable domain implies the nonclassicality of correlations. By analysing a toy model, it turns out that this argument implies the existence of quantum correlations distinct from entanglement and discord. We characterize such quantum correlations in terms of the net global coherence resources inherent within quantum states and show that entanglement and discord can be understood as special cases of our general framework. Finally, we provide an operational interpretation of such correlations as those allowing two distant parties to increase their respective local quantum computational resources only using locally incoherent operations and classical communication.",17,[],6

We show that, in principle, quantum mechanics allows measuring the expectation value of an observable in a partially transposed state, in spite of the fact that the latter may not be a physical state.

Thermal maps are a subgroup of CPTP maps with equilibrium. In general, for CPTP maps, the thermodynamic quantities, such as the entropy production or work performed on the system, depend on the combined state of the system plus its environment. We show that these quantities can be written in terms of system properties for maps with equilibrium. The relations that we obtain are valid for arbitrary coupling strengths between the system and the thermal bath.

We derive the entropy production fluctuation theorem for general maps and a fluctuation relation for the stochastic work on a system that starts in the Gibbs state. Some simplifications for the probability distributions in the case of maps with equilibrium are presented. We illustrate our results by considering spin 1/2 systems under thermal maps, non-thermal maps with equilibrium, maps with non-equilibrium steady states and concatenations of them. Finally, we consider a particular limit in which the concatenation of maps generates a continuous time evolution in Lindblad form for the system of interest, and we show that the concept of maps with and without equilibrium translates into Lindblad equations with and without quantum detailed balance, respectively.

An attractive proposal would be the use of Bell's inequalities as an entanglement witness, where only partial information of the quantum state is needed. The problem is that entanglement is necessary but not sufficient for violating Bell's inequalities, making it an unreliable state classifier.

1710.04700,quant-ph,"We describe and demonstrate a method to control a detuned movable-mirror Fabry-Perot cavity using radiation pressure in the presence of a strong optical spring. At frequencies below the optical spring resonance, self-locking of the cavity is achieved intrinsically by the optomechanical (OM) interaction between the cavity field and the movable end mirror. The OM interaction results in a high rigidity and reduced susceptibility of the mirror to external forces. However, due to a finite delay time in the cavity, this enhanced rigidity is accompanied by an anti-damping force, which destabilizes the cavity. The cavity is stabilized by applying external feedback in a frequency band around the optical spring resonance. The error signal is sensed in the amplitude quadrature of the transmitted beam with a photodetector. An amplitude modulator in the input path to the cavity modulates the light intensity to provide the stabilizing radiation pressure force.",17,['physics'],6
1705.06850,quant-ph,"Single atoms form a model system for understanding the limits of single photon detection. Here, we develop a non-Markov theory of single-photon absorption by a two-level atom to place limits on the absorption (transduction) time. We show the existence of a finite rise time in the probability of excitation of the atom during the absorption event which is infinitely fast in previous Markov theories. This rise time is governed by the bandwidth of the atom-field interaction spectrum and leads to a fundamental jitter in time-stamping the absorption event. Our theoretical framework captures both the weak and strong atom-field coupling regimes and sheds light on the spectral matching between the interaction bandwidth and single photon Fock state pulse spectrum. Our work opens questions whether such jitter in the absorption event can be observed in a multi-mode realistic single photon detector. Finally, we also shed light on the fundamental differences between linear and nonlinear detector outputs for single photon Fock state vs. coherent state pulses.",17,['physics'],6
1702.08228,quant-ph,"Quantum field theory predicts that a spatially homogeneous but temporally varying medium will excite photon pairs out of the vacuum state. However, this important theoretical prediction lacks experimental verification due to the difficulty in attaining the required non-adiabatic and large amplitude changes in the medium. Recent work has shown that in epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials it is possible to optically induce changes of the refractive index of the order of unity, in femtosecond timescales. By studying the quantum field theory of a spatially homogeneous, time-varying ENZ medium, we theoretically predict photon pair production that is up to several orders of magnitude larger than in non-ENZ time-varying materials. We also find that whilst in standard materials the emission spectrum depends on the time scale of the perturbation, in ENZ materials the emission is always peaked at the ENZ wavelength. These studies pave the way to technologically feasible observation of photon pair emission from a time-varying background with implications for quantum field theories beyond condensed matter systems and with potential applications as a new source of entangled light.",17,['physics'],6
1711.09641,quant-ph,"In order to model realistic quantum devices it is necessary to simulate quantum systems strongly coupled to their environment. To date, most understanding of open quantum systems is restricted either to weak system-bath couplings, or to special cases where specific numerical techniques become effective. Here we present a novel general numerical approach to efficiently describe the time evolution of a quantum system coupled to a non-Markovian environment. We demonstrate the power and flexibility of our method by numerically identifying the localisation transition of the Ohmic spin-boson model, and considering a model with widely separated environmental timescales arising for a pair of spins embedded in a common environment.",17,['cond-mat'],6
1711.02687,quant-ph,"We investigate the performance of a quantum algorithm for solving classical 3-SAT problems. A cycle of post-selected measurements drives the computer's register monotonically toward a steady state which is correlated to the classical solution(s). An internal parameter equation determines both the degree of correlation and the success probability, thus controlling the algorithm's runtime. Optionally this parameter can be gradually evolved during the algorithm's execution to create a Zeno-like effect; this can be viewed as an adiabatic evolution of a Hamiltonian which remains frustration-free at all points, and we lower-bound the corresponding gap. In exact numerical simulations of small systems up to 34 qubits our approach competes favourably with a high-performing classical 3-SAT solver, which itself outperforms a brute-force application of Grover's search.",17,[],6

The investigations are based on ab initio coupled disk modes. We apply optical spectroscopy involving a equation-setup, as well as mode-selective real space imaging and photoluminescence mapping to discern single QDs coupled to a resonant microdisk mode. Excitation of one disk of the double cavity structure and detecting photoluminescene from the other yields proof of single photon emission of a QD excited by incoherent energy transfer from one disk to the other via a mode in the weak coupling regime. Finally, we present evidence of photons emitted by a QD in one disk that are transferred to the other disk by a resonant mode and are subsequently resonantly scattered by another QD.",17,['physics'],6
1711.06142,quant-ph,"Driving a certain transition without including undesired transitions is an ubiquitous problem in quantum control and the implementation of quantum information processing. This problem gets the more challenging the weaker the desired transition couples to the control field, and the denser the system's spectrum is. With the explicit example of a trapped ion we show how temporally shaped driving helps to increase the fidelity of a gate operation beyond the regular spectral selection of resonantly driven transitions. We chose the explicit example of side-band transitions, since those couple more weakly to a control field than carrier transitions. Driving a sideband transition without carrier excitation thus allows us to test the limits of frequently employed control tools, and we discuss their potential and limitations.",17,[],6

The Nth cavity of a semi-infinite CRW intersecting with an infinite CRW and a cascade three level system(CTLS) form a T-bulge structure. Due to symmetry breaking boundary, the maximum of transfer rate would reach unity when light incidenting from the semi-infinite CRW, while reach 0.5 for infinite CRW case. The position of the intersection have effect on the location of the extreme point of the transmission coefficients changing with couple strength. 4D figures are used to illustrate the transmission characteristics, which is more visable.",17,[],6
1709.02310,quant-ph,"Open quantum systems exhibiting initial system-environment correlations are notoriously difficult to simulate. We point out that given a sufficiently long sample of the exact short-time evolution of the open system dynamics, one may employ transfer tensors for the further propagation of the reduced open system state. This approach is numerically advantageous and allows for the simulation of quantum correlation functions in hardly accessible regimes. We benchmark this approach against analytically exact solutions and exemplify it with the calculation of emission spectra of multichromophoric systems as well as for the reverse temperature estimation from simulated spectroscopic data. Finally, we employ our approach for the detection of spectral signatures of electromagnetically-induced transparency in open three-level systems.",17,[],6
1705.07427,quant-ph,"Koopman and von Neumann (KvN) extended the Liouville equation by introducing a phase space function equation whose physical meaning is unknown. We show that a different equation, with well-defined physical meaning, may be introduced without destroying the attractive ""quantum-like"" mathematical features of the KvN theory. This new equation is the classical action expressed in phase space coordinates. It defines a mapping between observables and operators which preserves the Lie bracket structure. The new evolution equation reduces to Schrodinger's equation if functions on phase space are reduced to functions on configuration space. This new kind of ""quantization"" does not only establish a correspondence between observables and operators, but provides in addition a derivation of quantum operators and evolution equations from corresponding classical entities. It is performed by replacing equation by equation and equation by equation, thus providing an explanation for the common quantization rules.",17,[],6
1702.00347,quant-ph,"We apply the notion of \emphoptimality of measurements for state determination(tomography) as originally given by Wootters and Fields to \emphweak value tomography of \emphpure states. They defined measurements to be optimal if they 'minimised' the effects of statistical errors. For technical reasons they actually maximised the state averaged information, precisely quantified as the negative logarithm of 'error volume'. In this paper we optimise both the state averaged information as well as error volumes. We prove, for Hilbert spaces of arbitrary (finite) dimensionality, that varieties of weak value measurements are optimal when the post-selected bases are \emphmutually unbiased with respect to the eigenvectors of the observable being measured. We prove a number of important results about the geometry of state spaces when expressed through the weak values as coordinates.

These maximally entangled states, where photons bunch at the exit of a beamsplitter, are measured experimentally by Fock-state projections. Entanglement is examined theoretically using a Bell-type nonlocality test and compared with ideal entangled coherent states. We experimentally show nearly perfect similarity with entangled coherent states for an optimal ratio of coherent and squeezed vacuum light. In our scheme, entangled coherent states are generated deterministically with small amplitudes, which could be beneficial, for example, in deterministic distribution of entanglement over long distances.",17,['physics'],6

Here, we study in detail the differences between a direct quantum cascade and coherent/incoherent driving for the case of two coupled cavity-QED systems. We discuss qualitative differences between these excitations scenarios, which are particular strong for higher-order photon-photon correlations: equation with equation. Quantum cascaded systems show a behavior differing from the idealized cases of individual coherent/incoherent driving and allow to produce qualitatively different quantum statistics. Furthermore, the quantum cascaded driving exhibits an interesting mixture of quantum coherent and incoherent excitation dynamics. We develop a measure, where the two regimes intermix and quantify these differences via experimentally accessible higher-order photon correlations.",17,[],6
1701.02252,quant-ph,"A synopsis is offered of the properties of discrete and integer-valued, hence ""natural"", cellular automata (CA). A particular class comprises the ""Hamiltonian CA"" with discrete updating rules that resemble Hamilton's equations. The resulting dynamics is linear like the unitary evolution described by the Schrodinger equation. Employing Shannon's Sampling Theorem, we construct an invertible map between such CA and continuous quantum mechanical models which incorporate a fundamental discreteness scale equation. Consequently, there is a one-to-one correspondence of quantum mechanical and CA conservation laws. We discuss the important issue of linearity, recalling that nonlinearities imply nonlocal effects in the continuous quantum mechanical description of intrinsically local discrete CA - requiring locality entails linearity. The admissible CA observables and the existence of solutions of the equation-dependent dispersion relation for stationary states are mentioned, besides the construction of multipartite CA obeying the Superposition Principle. We point out problems when trying to match the deterministic CA here to those envisioned in 't Hooft's CA Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.",17,"['math-ph', 'math', 'nlin']",6

1711.08676,quant-ph,"Spekkens' toy theory is a non-contextual hidden variable model with an epistemic restriction, a constraint on what the observer can know about the reality. It has been shown in [3] that for qudits of odd dimensions it is operationally equivalent to stabiliser quantum mechanics by making use of Gross' theory of discrete Wigner functions. This result does not hold in the case of qubits, because of the unavoidable negativity of any Wigner function representation of qubit stabiliser quantum mechanics. In this work we define and characterise the subtheories of Spekkens' theory that are operationally equivalent to subtheories of stabiliser quantum mechanics. We use these Spekkens' subtheories as a unifying framework for the known examples of state-injection schemes where contextuality is an injected resource to reach universal quantum computation. In addition, we prove that, in the case of qubits, stabiliser quantum mechanics can be reduced to a Spekkens' subtheory in the sense that all its objects that do not belong to the Spekkens' subtheory, namely non-covariant Clifford gates, can be injected. This shows that within Spekkens' subtheories we possess the toolbox to perform state-injection of every object outside of them and it suggests that there is no need to use bigger subtheories to reach universal quantum computation via state-injection. We conclude with a novel scheme of computation suggested by our approach which is based on the injection of CCZ states and we also relate different proofs of contextuality to different state injections of non-covariant gates.",17,[],6
