1902.09237,astro-ph,"We present the complete set of physical and geometrical parameters of the visual close binary system GJ\,9830 for the first time by using Al-Wardat's complex method. This method combines magnitude difference from speckle interferometry, synthetic spectral energy distributions of the binary components which are constructed depending on grids of Kurucz blanketed models (Atlas9), along with the orbital solution by using Tokovinin's dynamical method to estimate the parameters of the individual components. The analysis of the system by using synthetic photometry resulted in the following set of parameters: equation \,K, equation, equation for the primary component and equation\,K, equation, equation for the secondary component. The recently published dynamical parallax from \textitGaia space mission was used to calculate the total mass of the binary system as equation which coincides with those estimated by using Al-Wardat's method as equation, equation.   The analysis of the system reveals that both components belong to main sequence stars with an age around equation\,Gyr. The evolutionary tracks and isochrones of the system's components are discussed, and the fragmentation process is suggested as the most likely process for the formation of the system.",2019,[],5
1903.11906,astro-ph,"In dense clouds of the interstellar medium, dust grains are covered by ice mantles, dominated by HequationO. CO and COequation are common ice components observed in infrared spectra, while infrared inactive Nequation is expected to be present in the ice. Molecules in the ice can be dissociated, react or desorb by exposure to secondary ultraviolet photons. Thus, different physical scenarios lead to different ice mantle compositions. This work aims to understand the behaviour of equationCO : Nequation and equationCOequation : Nequation ice mixtures submitted to ultraviolet radiation in the laboratory. Photochemical processes and photodesorption were studied for various ratios of the ice components. Experiments were carried out under ultra-high vacuum conditions at 12K. Ices were irradiated with a continuous emission ultraviolet lamp simulating the secondary ultraviolet in dense interstellar clouds. During the irradiation periods, fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was used for monitoring changes in the ice, and quadrupole mass spectrometry for gas-phase molecules. In irradiated equationCOequation : Nequation ice mixtures, equationCO, equationCOequation, equationCOequation, Oequation, and Oequation photoproducts were detected in the infrared spectra. Nequation molecules also take part in the photochemistry, and N-bearing molecules were also detected: NO, NOequation, NequationO, and NequationOequation. Photodesorption rates and their dependence on the presence of Nequation were also studied. As it was previously reported, equationCO and equationCOequation molecules can transfer photon energy to Nequation molecules. As a result, equationCO and equationCOequation photodesorption rates decrease as the fraction of Nequation increases, while Nequation photodesorption is enhanced with respect to the low UV-absorbing pure Nequation ice.",2019,[],5
1905.02731,astro-ph,"Identifying the compact object in ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) has to-date required detection of pulsations or a cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF), indicating a magnetised neutron star. However, pulsations are observed to be transient and it is plausible that accretion onto the neutron star may have suppressed the surface magnetic field such that pulsations and CRSFs will be entirely absent. We may therefore lack direct means to identify neutron star systems whilst we presently lack an effective means by which to identify black hole ULXs. Here we present a possible method for separating the ULX population by assuming the X-ray, mHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and day timescale periods/QPOs are associated with Lense-Thirring precession of the inflow and outflowing wind respectively. The precession timescales combined with the temperature of the soft X-ray component produce planes where the accretor mass enters as a free parameter. Depending on the properties of the wind, use of these planes may be robust to a range in the angular momentum (spin) and, for high accretion rates, essentially independent of the neutron star's surface dipole field strength. Our model also predicts the mHz QPO frequency and magnitude of the phase-lag imprinted due to propagation through the optically thick wind; in the case of NGC 5408 X-1 we subsequently infer a black hole mass and high spin. Finally, we note that observing secular QPO evolution over sufficient baselines may indicate a neutron star, as the precession responds to spin-up which is not readily observable for black hole primaries.",2019,[],5
1908.11159,astro-ph,At the 36 th ICRC during 11 parallel Gamma-Ray Indirect sessions in total about 70 talks were presented. A few of the plenary highlight talks as well concerned mostly indirect observations of gamma rays. In addition about 140 posters on this topic have been shown in poster sessions. This rapport tries to summarize the results presented in those contributions.,2019,[],5
1906.10216,astro-ph,"Ultra-wideband 3D imaging spectrometry in the millimeter-submillimeter (mm-submm) band is an essential tool for uncovering the dust-enshrouded portion of the cosmic history of star formation and galaxy evolution. However, it is challenging to scale up conventional coherent heterodyne receivers or free-space diffraction techniques to sufficient bandwidths (equation1 octave) and numbers of spatial pixels (>equation). Here we present the design and first astronomical spectra of an intrinsically scalable, integrated superconducting spectrometer, which covers 332-377 GHz with a spectral resolution of equation. It combines the multiplexing advantage of microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) with planar superconducting filters for dispersing the signal in a single, small superconducting integrated circuit. We demonstrate the two key applications for an instrument of this type: as an efficient redshift machine, and as a fast multi-line spectral mapper of extended areas. The line detection sensitivity is in excellent agreement with the instrument design and laboratory performance, reaching the atmospheric foreground photon noise limit on sky. The design can be scaled to bandwidths in excess of an octave, spectral resolution up to a few thousand and frequencies up to equation1.1 THz. The miniature chip footprint of a few equation allows for compact multi-pixel spectral imagers, which would enable spectroscopic direct imaging and large volume spectroscopic surveys that are several orders of magnitude faster than what is currently possible.",2019,[],5
1902.07048,astro-ph,"Classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) are young low-mass stellar objects accreting mass from their circumstellar disks. They are characterized by high levels of coronal activity as revealed by X-ray observations. This activity may affect the disk stability and the circumstellar environment. Here we investigate if an intense coronal activity due to flares occurring close to the accretion disk may perturb the inner disk stability, disrupt the inner part of the disk and, possibly, trigger accretion phenomena with rates comparable with those observed. We model a magnetized protostar surrounded by an accretion disk through 3D magnetohydrodinamic simulations. We explore cases characterized by a dipole plus an octupole stellar magnetic field configuration and different density of the disk or by different levels of flaring activity. As a result of the simulated intense flaring activity, we observe the formation of several loops that link the star to the disk; all these loops build up a hot extended corona with an X-ray luminosity comparable with typical values observed in CTTSs. The intense flaring activity close to the disk can strongly perturb the disk stability. The flares trigger overpressure waves which travel through the disk and modify its configuration. Accretion funnels may be triggered by the flaring activity, thus contributing to the mass accretion rate of the star. Accretion rates synthesized from the simulations are in a range between 10-10 and 10-9Msun yr-1 The accretion columns can be perturbed by the flares and they can interact with each other, possibly merging together in larger streams. As a result, the accretion pattern can be rather complex: the streams are highly inhomogeneous, with a complex density structure, and clumped",2019,[],5
1911.07854,astro-ph,"We present VLT/SINFONI near-infrared (NIR) integral field spectroscopy of six equation Lyman break galaxy ""analogs"" (LBAs), from which we detect HI, HeI, and [FeII] recombination lines, and multiple Hequation ro-vibrational lines in emission. Paequation kinematics reveal high velocity dispersions and low rotational velocities relative to random motions (equation). Matched-aperture comparisons of Hequation, Hequation, and Paequation reveal that the nebular color excesses are lower relative to the continuum color excesses than is the case for typical local star-forming systems. We compare observed HeI/HI recombination line ratios to photoionization models to gauge the effective temperatures (Tequation) of massive ionizing stars, finding the properties of at least one LBA are consistent with extra heating from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and/or an overabundance of massive stars. We use Hequation 1-0 S(equation) ro-vibrational spectra to determine rotational excitation temperature equation K for warm molecular gas, which we attribute to UV heating in dense photon-dominated regions. Spatially resolved NIR line ratios favor excitation by massive, young stars, rather than supernovae or AGN feedback. Our results suggest that the local analogs of Lyman break galaxies are primarily subject to strong feedback from recent star formation, with evidence for AGN and outflows in some cases.",2019,[],5
1906.00892,astro-ph,"The ESA PLATO space mission is devoted to unveiling and characterizing new extrasolar planets and their host stars. This mission will encompass a very large field of view, granting it the potential to survey up to one million stars depending on the final observation strategy. The telemetry budget of the spacecraft cannot handle transmitting individual images for such a huge stellar sample at the right cadence, so the development of an appropriate strategy to perform on-board data reduction is mandatory. We employ aperture photometry to produce stellar light curves in flight. Our aim is thus to find the mask model that optimizes the scientific performance of the reduced data. We considered three distinct aperture models: binary mask, weighted Gaussian mask, and weighted gradient mask giving lowest noise-to-signal ratio, computed through a novel direct method. An innovative criterion was adopted for choosing between different mask models. We designated as optimal the model providing the best compromise between sensitivity to detect true and false planet transits. We determined the optimal model based on simulated noise-to-signal ratio and frequency of threshold crossing events. Our results show that, although the binary mask statistically presents a few percent higher noise-to-signal ratio compared to weighted masks, both strategies have very similar efficiency in detecting legitimate planet transits. When it comes to avoiding spurious signals from contaminant stars however the binary mask statistically collects considerably less contaminant flux than weighted masks, thereby allowing the former to deliver up to equation30\% less false transit signatures at equation. Our proposed approach for choosing apertures has been proven to be decisive for the determination of a mask model capable to provide near maximum planet yield and substantially reduced occurrence of false positives.",2019,[],5
1904.07570,astro-ph,"Cyanogen (NCCN) is the simplest member of the dicyanopolyynes group, and has been proposed as a major source of the CN radical observed in cometary atmospheres. Although not detected through its rotational spectrum in the cold interstellar medium, this very stable species is supposed to be very abundant. The chemistry of cyanogen in the cold interstellar medium can be investigated through its metastable isomer, CNCN (isocyanogen). Its formation may provide a clue on the widely abundant CN radical observed in cometary atmospheres. We performed an unbiased spectral survey of the L1544 proto-typical prestellar core, using the IRAM-30m and have analysed, for this paper, the nitrogen chemistry that leads to the formation of isocyanogen. We report on the first detection of CNCN, NCCNH, C3N, CH3CN, C2H3CN, and H2CN in L1544. We built a detailed chemical network for NCCN/CNCN/HC2N2 involving all the nitrogen bearing species detected (CN, HCN, HNC, C3N, CNCN, CH3CN, CH2CN, HCCNC, HC3N, HNC3, H2CN, C2H3CN, HCNH, HC3NH) and the upper limits on C4N, C2N. The main cyanogen production pathways considered in the network are the CN  HNC and N  C3N reactions. The comparison between the observations of the nitrogen bearing species and the predictions from the chemical modelling shows a very good agreement, taking into account the new chemical network. The expected cyanogen abundance is greater than the isocyanogen abundance by a factor of 100. Although cyanogen cannot be detected through its rotational spectrum, the chemical modelling predicts that it should be abundant in the gas phase and hence might be traced through the detection of isocyanogen. It is however expected to have a very low abundance on the grain surfaces compared to HCN.",2019,[],5
1908.00132,astro-ph,"HD~100546 is a Herbig Ae/Be star surrounded by a disk with a large central region that is cleared of gas and dust (i.e., an inner hole). High-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy reveals a rich emission spectrum of fundamental ro-vibrational CO emission lines whose time variable properties point to the presence of an orbiting companion within the hole. The Doppler shift and spectroastrometric signal of the CO v=1-0 P26 line, observed from 2003 to 2013, are consistent with a source of excess CO emission that orbits the star near the inner rim of the disk. The properties of the excess emission are consistent with those of a circumplanetary disk. In this paper, we report follow up observations that confirm our earlier prediction that the orbiting source of excess emission would disappear behind the near side of the inner rim of the outer disk in 2017. We find that while the hotband CO lines remained unchanged in 2017, the v=1-0 P26 line and its spectroastrometric signal returned to the profile observed in 2003. With these new observations, we further constrain the origin of the emission and discuss possible ways of confirming the presence of an orbiting planetary companion in the inner disk.",2019,[],5
1912.07847,astro-ph,"A handful of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are now known to repeat. However, the question remains --- do they all? We report on an extensive observational campaign with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), Parkes, and Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, searching for repeat bursts from FRBs detected by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients survey. In 383.2 hr of follow-up observations covering 27 FRBs initially detected as single bursts, only two repeat bursts from a single FRB, FRB 171019, were detected, which have been previously reported by Kumar et al. We use simulations of repeating FRBs that allow for clustering in burst arrival times to calculate new estimates for the repetition rate of FRB 171019, finding only slight evidence for incompatibility with the properties of FRB 121102. Our lack of repeat bursts from the remaining FRBs set limits on the model of all bursts being attributable to repeating FRBs. Assuming a reasonable range of repetition behaviour, at most 60% (90% C.L.) of these FRBs having an intrinsic burst distribution similar to FRB~121102. This result is shown to be robust against different assumptions on the nature of repeating FRB behaviour, and indicates that if indeed all FRBs repeat, the majority must do so very rarely.",2019,[],5
1911.08331,astro-ph,"Transiting planets provide a unique opportunity to search for unseen additional bodies gravitationally bound to a system. It is possible to detect the motion of the center-of-mass of the observed transiting planet-host star duo due to the gravitational tugs of the unseen bodies from the Roemer delay. In order to achieve the goal, determination of the mid-times of the transits of the planets in high precision and accuracy and correct them for the orbital motion of the Earth is a primary condition. We present transit timing variations and update the ephemeris information of 5 transiting planets; HAT-P-23b, WASP-103b, GJ-1214b, WASP-69b, and KELT-3b within this contribution, based on all the quality transit light curves from amateur and professional observers, converted to Dynamic Barycentric Julian Days (BJD-TDB).",2019,[],5
1903.04030,astro-ph,"There is a dichotomy in the Milky Way in the equationFe]-[Fe/H] plane, in which stars fall into high-equation, and low-equation sequences. The high-equation sequence comprises mostly old stars, and the low-equation sequence comprises primarily young stars. The origin of this dichotomy is uncertain. To better understand how the high- and low-equation stars are affiliated, we examine if the high- and low-equation sequences have distinct orbits at all ages, or if age sets the orbital properties of stars irrespective of their equation-enhancement. Orbital actions equation, equation, and equation (or equation) are our labels of stellar dynamics. We use ages for 58,278 LAMOST stars (measured to a precision of 40\%) within equation2kpc of the Sun and we calculate orbital actions from proper motions and parallaxes given by Gaia's DR2. We find that \emphat all ages, the high- and low-equation sequences are dynamically distinct. This implies separate formation and evolutionary histories for the two sequences; a star's membership in the high- or low-equation sequence indicates its dynamical properties at a given time. We use action space to make an efficient selection of halo stars and subsequently report a group of old, low-equation stars in the halo, which may be a discrete population from an infall event.",2019,[],5
1904.00236,astro-ph,"Earthshine is the dominant source of natural illumination on the surface of the Moon during lunar night, and at locations within permanently shadowed regions that never receive direct sunlight. As such, earthshine may enable the exploration of areas of the Moon that are hidden from solar illumination. The heat flux from earthshine may also influence the transport and cold trapping of volatiles present in the very coldest areas. In this study, Earth's spectral radiance at the Moon is examined using a suite of Earth spectral models created using the Virtual Planetary Laboratory (VPL) three dimensional modeling capability. At the Moon, the broadband, hemispherical irradiance from Earth near 0 phase is approximately 0.15 watts per square meter, with comparable contributions from solar reflectance and thermal emission. Over the simulation timeframe, spanning two lunations, Earth's thermal irradiance changes less than a few mW per square meter as a result of cloud variability and the south-to-north motion of sub-observer position. In solar band, Earth's diurnally averaged light curve at phase angles < 60 degrees is well fit using a Henyey Greenstein integral phase function. At wavelengths > 0.7 microns, near the well known vegetation ""red edge"", Earth's reflected solar radiance shows significant diurnal modulation as a result of the longitudinal asymmetry in projected landmass, as well as from the distribution of clouds. A simple formulation with adjustable coefficients is presented for estimating Earth's hemispherical irradiance at the Moon as a function of wavelength, phase angle and sub-observer coordinates. It is demonstrated that earthshine is sufficiently bright to serve as a natural illumination source for optical measurements from the lunar surface.",2019,[],5
1910.11357,astro-ph,"Baryonic feedback effects lead to a suppression of the weak lensing angular power spectrum on small scales. The poorly constrained shape and amplitude of this suppression is an important source of uncertainties for upcoming cosmological weak lensing surveys such as Euclid or LSST. In this first paper in a series of two, we use simulations to build a Euclid-like tomographic mock data-set for the cosmic shear power spectrum and the corresponding covariance matrix, which are both corrected for baryonic effects following the baryonification method of Schneider et al. (2019). In addition, we develop an emulator to obtain fast predictions of the baryonic power suppression, allowing us to perform a likelihood inference analysis for a standard equationCDM cosmology with both cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Our main findings are the following: (i) ignoring baryonic effects leads to a greater than 5equation bias on the cosmological parameters equation and equation; (ii) restricting the analysis to the largest scales, that are mostly unaffected by baryons, makes the bias disappear, but results in a blow-up of the equation-equation contour area by more than a factor of 10; (iii) ignoring baryonic effects on the covariance matrix does not significantly affect cosmological parameter estimates; (iv) while the baryonic suppression is mildly cosmology dependent, this effect does not noticeably modify the posterior contours. Overall, we conclude that including baryonic uncertainties in terms of nuisance parameters results in unbiased and surprisingly tight constraints on cosmology.",2019,[],5
1907.07870,astro-ph,"Thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) power spectrum is a powerful probe of the present-day amplitude of matter density fluctuations, and has been measured up to equation from the \it Planck data. The largest systematic uncertainty in the interpretation of this data is the so-called ""mass bias"" parameter equation, which relates the true halo mass to the mass proxy used by the \it Planck team as equation. Since the power spectrum of the cosmic weak lensing shear is also sensitive to the amplitude of matter density fluctuations via equation with equation, we can break the degeneracy between the mass bias and the cosmological parameters by combining the tSZ and cosmic shear power spectra. In this paper, we perform a joint likelihood analysis of the tSZ power spectrum from \it Planck and the cosmic shear power spectrum from Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam. Our analysis does not use the primordial cosmic microwave background (CMB) information. We obtain a new constraint on the mass bias as equation or equation (68\%~C.L.), for equation. This value of equation is lower than that needed to reconcile the tSZ data with the primordial CMB and CMB lensing data, i.e., equation, but is consistent with the mass bias expected from hydrodynamical simulations, equation. Our results thus indicate that the mass bias is consistent with the non-thermal pressure support from mass accretion of galaxy clusters via the cosmic structure formation, and that the cosmologies inferred from the tSZ and the cosmic shear are consistent with each other.",2019,[],5
1908.11485,astro-ph,"The Diffuse Gamma-Ray Background (DGB) above 100 GeV at high-latitudes is expected to be produced by unresolved extragalactic objects such as active galactic nuclei, isotropic Galactic gamma-rays, and possible emission from dark matter annihilations or decays in the Galactic dark matter halo. The DGB has been observed up to nearly 1 TeV, but has yet to be detected at higher energies. Detections or stringent limits on the DGB above this energy would have strong multimessenger consequences, such as constraining the origin of astrophysical neutrinos observed in IceCube. The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory has its highest sensitivity to gamma rays above 1 TeV and observes over 2/3 of the sky each day. With its high energy reach and large areal coverage, HAWC can significantly improve searches of the DGB at TeV energies. We will investigate parameter cuts to the HAWC dataset to better isolate gamma-ray air showers from background hadronic showers. This, combined with new background estimation techniques will improve the HAWC sensitivity to the DGB. We will present a limit on the DGB with HAWC as well as its implications for multimessenger and dark matter studies.",2019,[],5
1903.12404,astro-ph,"We demonstrate how the FRB redshift and fluence distributions from the Parkes, ASKAP and CHIME telescopes can be used together to constrain the properties of the FRB population. Here we consider a simple model where all the FRBs have the same spectral index equation and rest frame energy equation (specified in a fixed band equation to equation). We find that the constraints on equation depend on the scattering model for pulse broadening in the inter-galactic medium. For no scattering we find that there is a region of parameter space where the predictions are simultaneously consistent with the FRB redshift and fluence distributions at all three telescopes. The allowed equation range is bounded by equation and the allowed equation range is bounded by equation. Our analysis also rules out an empirical scattering model where the FRB pulse broadening in the IGM is predicted by extrapolating pulse broadening observed for pulsars in the ISM.",2019,[],5
1910.03130,astro-ph,"We investigate the impact of a highly eccentric 10 equation (where equation is the Earth mass) planet embedded in a dusty protoplanetary disk on the dust dynamics and its observational implications. By carrying out high-resolution 2D gas and dust two-fluid hydrodynamical simulations, we find that the planet's orbit can be circularized at large radii. After the planet's orbit is circularized, partial gap opening and dust ring formation happen close to the planet's circularization radius, which can explain the observed gaps/rings at the outer region of disks. When the disk mass and viscosity become low, we find that an eccentric planet can even open gaps and produce dust rings close to the pericenter and apocenter radii before its circularization. This offers alternative scenarios for explaining the observed dust rings and gaps in protoplanetary disks. A lower disk viscosity is favored to produce brighter rings in observations. An eccentric planet can also potentially slow down the dust radial drift in the outer region of the disk when the disk viscosity is low (equation) and the circularization is faster than the dust radial drift.",2019,[],5

High-resolution high-temperature H2-pressure-broadened spectra are recorded for the CH4 v3-band P-branch. Measured linewidths for 116 transitions between 2840 and 3000 cm-1 with temperature and pressures ranging between 300 and 700 K, and 10 and 933 Torr, respectively, were used to find rotation- and tetrahedral-symmetry-dependent coefficients for pressure and temperature broadening and pressure-induced lineshifts.

1912.05708,astro-ph,"NICER observed several rotation-powered millisecond pulsars to search for or confirm the presence of X-ray pulsations. When broad and sine-like, these pulsations may indicate thermal emission from hot polar caps at the magnetic poles on the neutron star surface. We report confident detections (equation after background filtering) of X-ray pulsations for five of the seven pulsars in our target sample: PSR J0614-3329, PSR J06365129, PSR J07511807, PSR J10125307, and PSR J2241-5236, while PSR J15525437 and PSR J1744-1134 remain undetected. Of those, only PSR J07511807 and PSR J10125307 had pulsations previously detected at the 1.7equation and almost 3equation confidence levels, respectively, in XMM-Newton data. All detected sources exhibit broad sine-like pulses, which are indicative of surface thermal radiation. As such, these MSPs are promising targets for future X-ray observations aimed at constraining the neutron star mass-radius relation and the dense matter equation of state using detailed pulse profile modeling. Furthermore, we find that three of the detected millisecond pulsars exhibit a significant phase offset between their X-ray and radio pulses.",2019,[],5
1905.02212,astro-ph,"We present a catalog of compact double radio galaxies (hereafter COMP2equation) listing 43 edge-brightened radio sources whose projected linear size does not exceed 60 kpc, the typical size of their host galaxies. This is the fifth in a series of radio source catalogs recently created, namely: FRIequation, FRIIequation, FR0equation and WATequation, each focused on a different class of radio galaxies. The main aim of our analysis is to attain a better understanding of sources with intermediate morphologies between FR\,IIs and FR\,0s. COMP2equation sources were selected from an existing catalog of radio sources based on NVSS, FIRST and SDSS observations for having, mainly, i) edge-brightened morphologies, typical of FR\,IIs, ii) redshifts equation and iii) projected linear sizes smaller than 60 kpc. With radio luminosities at 1.4 GHz equation erg sequation, COMP2equation sources appear as the low radio luminosity tail of FR\,IIs. However, their host galaxies are indistinguishable from those of large-scale radio sources: they are luminous (equation), red, early-type galaxies with black hole masses in the range of equation. Moreover, all but one of the COMP2equation sources are optically classifiable as low excitation radio galaxies, in agreement with being the low radio-power tail of FR\,Is and FR\,IIs.

1909.03971,astro-ph,"The first two LIGO and Virgo observation runs have been important milestones in the gravitational wave (GW) field, thanks to the detection of GW signals from ten binary black hole systems and a binary neutron star system. In order to fully characterize the emitting source, the remnant object and its environment, electromagnetic follow-up observations at different wavelengths are essential, as learned from the GW170817/GRB170817A case. Given the quite large localization uncertainties provided by interferometers, the main challenge faced by facilities with a narrow field of view (e.g. Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, IACTs) is to setup a suitable follow-up strategy in order to observe sky regions with the highest probability to host the electromagnetic (EM) counterpart of the GW signal. As member of the EM follow-up community, the MAGIC collaboration joined this effort in 2014. As the third observation run (O3) is currently ongoing, where both LIGO and Virgo are expected to have much better sensitivities, MAGIC is refining its follow-up strategy to maximize the chances of observing the EM counterparts as soon as possible. In this contribution we will describe this strategy, focusing on the different observation cases, which mainly depends on the information available from both GW and EM partner facilities.",2019,[],5

1910.11387,astro-ph,"Pulsars have been identified as good candidates for the acceleration of cosmic rays, up to ultra-high energies. However, a precise description of the acceleration processes at play is still to be established. Using 2D particle-in-cell simulations, we study proton acceleration in axisymmetric pulsar magnetospheres. Protons and electrons are extracted from the neutron star surface by the strong electric field induced by the rotation of the star, and electrons and positrons are produced in the magnetosphere through pair production process. As pair production has a crucial impact on electromagnetic fields, on gaps and thus on particle acceleration, we study its influence on the maximum energy and luminosity of protons escaping the magnetosphere. Protons are accelerated and escape in all our simulations. However, the acceleration sites are different for the protons and the pairs. As shown in previous studies, pairs are accelerated to their highest energies at the Y-point and in the equatorial current sheet, where magnetic reconnection plays and important role. In contrast, protons gain most of their kinetic energy below the light-cylinder radius within the separatrix current layers, but they are not confined within the equatorial current sheet. Their maximum Lorentz factors can reach equation to equation of the maximum Lorentz factor obtained by acceleration through the full vacuum potential drop from pole to equator, and increase with decreasing pair production. Their luminosity can reach equation to equation of the theoretical spin down luminosity of an aligned pulsar, and the minimum luminosity is obtained at the transition between the force-free and electrosphere regimes. These estimates support that millisecond pulsars could accelerate cosmic rays up to PeV energies and that new born millisecond pulsars could accelerate cosmic rays up to ultra-high energies.",2019,[],5
1912.08543,astro-ph,"We present the light curve of HS 02298016 between 2006 and 2019 which shows that the star varies between mag 13.4 and 15.1. There were episodes lasting up to hundreds of days during which distinctive 0.6 mag cyclic variations were apparent, each lasting ca. 9.5 days. Observationally, these are very similar to the stunted outbursts seen from time to time in several nova-like cataclysmic variables, such as UU Aqr. There are two intervals of up to 166 days when these stunted outbursts appeared to reduce or even stop. These coincide with the system being up to ca. 0.7 mag fainter than usual. Previous workers have suggested that HS 02298016 might be a member of the Z Cam family of dwarf novae, but we can find no evidence of the characteristic dwarf nova outbursts and standstills at an intermediate brightness.

The binary modelling indicates that the two component stars have almost the same radius and may have experienced orbital circularization. Frequency analyses are performed for the residual light curve after subtracting the binary variations. The frequency spectrum reveals that one component star is a letter Scuti variable. A large frequency separation is cross-identified with the histogram graph, the Fourier transform, and the echelle diagram method.

1907.10733,astro-ph,"We present an ultraviolet quasar absorption line analysis of metal lines associated with three strong intervening H I absorbers (with equation(H I) equation 10equation cmequation) detected in the outskirts of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect-selected galaxy clusters (equation), within clustocentric impact parameters of equation equation equation. Discovered in a recent set of targeted far-UV equation/COS spectroscopic observations, these absorbers have the highest H I column densities ever observed in the outskirts of galaxy clusters, and are also rich in metal absorption lines. Photoionization models yield single phase solutions for the three absorbers with gas densities of equation cmequation and metallicities of [X/H] equation -1.0 (from one-tenth solar to near-solar). The widths of detected absorption lines suggest gas temperatures of equation K. The inferred densities (temperatures) are significantly higher (lower) compared to the X-ray emitting intracluster medium in cluster cores. The absorbers are tracing a cool phase of the intracluster gas in the cluster outskirts, either associated with gas stripped from cluster galaxies via outflows, tidal streams or ram-pressure forces, or denser regions within the intracluster medium that were uniformly chemically enriched from an earlier epoch of enhanced supernova and AGN feedback.",2019,[],5
1911.01197,astro-ph,"Here we discuss the jet production efficiency in a sample of 17 young radio galaxies with measured redshifts, kinematic ages, and nuclear X-ray fluxes, for which the observed luminosities of compact jets/lobes and accretion disks correspond to the same episode of the AGN activity. For the targets, we analyze the available optical data, estimating the bolometric luminosities of the accretion disks equation, and the black hole masses; we also derive the minimum jet kinetic luminosities, equation. With such, we investigate the distribution of our sample in the three-dimensional space of the accretion rate equation, the nuclear X-ray luminosity equation considered here as a limit for the emission of the disk coronae, and equation, expressing the latter two parameters either in the Eddington units, or in the units of the disk luminosity. We find that (i) the accretion rate equation in our sample is distributed within a narrow range equation; (ii) the normalized jet power equation formally correlates with the accretion rate equation, with some saturation at the largest values equation; (iii) the jet production efficiency equation spans a range from equation up to equation at maximum, which is below the level expected for magnetically arrested disks around maximally spinning black holes; and (iv) there is a diversification in equation on the hardness--intensity diagram equation, with the jets being produced most efficiently during the high/hard states, and suppressed during the soft states.",2019,[],5
1911.11841,astro-ph,"Cosmic rays in galaxy clusters are unique probes of energetic processes operating with large-scale structures in the Universe. Precise measurements of cosmic rays in galaxy clusters are essential for improving our understanding of non-thermal components in the intracluster-medium (ICM) as well as the accuracy of cluster mass estimates in cosmological analyses. In this paper, we perform a cross-correlation analysis with the extragalactic gamma-ray background and the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect in the cosmic microwave background. The expected cross-correlation signal would contain rich information about the cosmic-ray-induced gamma-ray emission in the most massive galaxy clusters at equation. We analyze the gamma-ray background map with 8 years of data taken by the Large Area Telescope onboard Fermi satellite and the publicly available tSZ map by Planck. We confirm that the measured cross-correlation is consistent with a null detection, and thus it enables us to put the tightest constraint on the acceleration efficiency of cosmic ray protons at shocks in and around galaxy clusters. We find the acceleration efficiency must be below 5\% with a equation confidence level when the hydrostatic mass bias of clusters is assumed to be 30\%, and our result is not significantly affected by the assumed value of the hydrostatic mass bias. Our constraint implies that the non-thermal cosmic-ray pressure in the ICM can introduce only a equation level of the hydrostatic mass bias, highlighting that cosmic rays alone do not account for the mass bias inferred by the Planck analyses. Finally, we discuss future detectability prospects of cosmic-ray-induced gamma rays from the Perseus cluster for the Cherenkov Telescope Array.",2019,[],5
1907.06717,astro-ph,"We present a clean, magnitude-limited (IRAC1 or WISE1 equation 15.0 mag) multiwavelength source catalog for the SMC with 45,466 targets in total, with the purpose of building an anchor for future studies, especially for the massive star populations at low-metallicity. The catalog contains data in 50 different bands including 21 optical and 29 infrared bands, ranging from the ultraviolet to the far-infrared. Additionally, radial velocities and spectral classifications were collected from the literature, as well as infrared and optical variability statistics were retrieved from different projects. The catalog was essentially built upon a equation crossmatching and a equation deblending between the SEIP source list and Gaia DR2 photometric data. Further constraints on the proper motions and parallaxes from Gaia DR2 allowed us to remove the foreground contamination. We estimated that about 99.5\% of the targets in our catalog were most likely genuine members of the SMC. By using the evolutionary tracks and synthetic photometry from MIST and the theoretical equation color cuts, we identified 1,405 RSG, 217 YSG and 1,369 BSG candidates in the SMC in five different CMDs, where attention should also be paid to the incompleteness of our sample. We ranked the candidates based on the intersection of different CMDs. A comparison between the models and observational data shows that the lower limit of initial mass for the RSGs population may be as low as 7 or even 6 equation and the RSG is well separated from the AGB population even at faint magnitude, making RSGs a unique population connecting the evolved massive and intermediate stars, since stars with initial mass around 6 to 8 equation are thought to go through a second dredge-up to become AGBs.

1907.06039,astro-ph,"State-of-the-art one-dimensional (1D) stellar evolution codes rely on simplifying assumptions, such as mixing length theory, in order to describe superadiabatic convection. As a result, 1D stellar structure models do not correctly recover the surface layers of the Sun and other stars with convective envelopes. We present a method that overcomes this structural drawback by employing three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic simulations of stellar envelopes: at every time-step of the evolution interpolated 3D envelopes are appended to the 1D structure and are used to supply realistic boundary conditions for the stellar interior. In contrast to previous attempts, our method includes mean 3D turbulent pressure. We apply our method to model the present Sun. The structural shortcomings of standard stellar models lead to systematic errors in the stellar oscillation frequencies inferred from the model. We show that our method fully corrects for this error. Furthermore, we show that our realistic treatment of superadiabatic convection alters the predicted evolution of the Sun. Our results hence have important implications for the characterization of stars. This has ramifications for neighbouring fields, such as exoplanet research and galactic archaeology, for which accurate stellar models play a key role.",2019,[],5
1902.01860,astro-ph,"The evolution of molecular clouds in galactic centres is thought to differ from that in galactic discs due to a significant influence of the external gravitational potential. We present a set of numerical simulations of molecular clouds orbiting on the 100-pc stream of the Central Molecular Zone (the central equation pc of the Galaxy) and characterise their morphological and kinematic evolution in response to the background potential and eccentric orbital motion. We find that the clouds are shaped by strong shear and torques, by tidal and geometric deformation, and by their passage through the orbital pericentre. Within our simulations, these mechanisms control cloud sizes, aspect ratios, position angles, filamentary structure, column densities, velocity dispersions, line-of-sight velocity gradients, spin angular momenta, and kinematic complexity. By comparing these predictions to observations of clouds on the Galactic Centre 'dust ridge', we find that our simulations naturally reproduce a broad range of key observed morphological and kinematic features, which can be explained in terms of well-understood physical mechanisms. We argue that the accretion of gas clouds onto the central regions of galaxies, where the rotation curve turns over and the tidal field is fully compressive, is accompanied by transformative dynamical changes to the clouds, leading to collapse and star formation. This can generate an evolutionary progression of cloud collapse with a common starting point, which either marks the time of accretion onto the tidally-compressive region or of the most recent pericentre passage. Together, these processes may naturally produce the synchronised starbursts observed in numerous (extra)galactic nuclei.",2019,[],5
1906.05371,astro-ph,"The streaming instability for solid particles in protoplanetary disks is re-examined assuming the familiar alpha (equation) model for isotropic turbulence. Turbulence always reduces the growth rates of the streaming instability relative to values calculated for globally laminar disks. While for small values of the turbulence parameter, equation, the wavelengths of the fastest-growing disturbances are small fractions of the local gas vertical scale height equation, we find that for moderate values of the turbulence parameter, i.e., equation, the lengthscales of maximally growing disturbances shift toward larger scales, approaching equation. At these moderate turbulent intensities and for local particle to gas mass density ratios equation, the vertical scales of the most unstable modes begin to exceed the corresponding radial scales so that the instability appears in the form of vertically oriented sheets extending well beyond the particle scale height. We find that for hydrodynamical turbulent disk models reported in the literature, with equation, together with state of the art global evolution models of particle growth, the streaming instability is predicted to be viable within a narrow triangular patch of equation--equation parameter space centered on Stokes numbers, equation and equation and, further, exhibits growth rates on the order of several hundred to thousands of orbit times for disks with 1 percent (equation) cosmic solids abundance or metallicity.

1904.00663,astro-ph,"New generation of radio interferometers are envisaged to produce high quality, high dynamic range Stokes images of the observed sky from the corresponding under-sampled Fourier domain measurements. In practice, these measurements are contaminated by the instrumental and atmospheric effects that are well represented by Jones matrices, and are most often varying with observation direction and time. These effects, usually unknown, act as a limiting factor in achieving the required imaging performance and thus, their calibration is crucial. To address this issue, we develop a global algorithm, named Polca SARA, aiming to perform full polarization, direction-dependent calibration and sparse imaging by employing a non-convex optimization technique. In contrast with the existing approaches, the proposed method offers global convergence guarantees and flexibility to incorporate sophisticated priors to regularize the imaging as well as the calibration problem. Thus, we adapt a polarimetric imaging specific method, enforcing the physical polarization constraint along with a sparsity prior for the sought images. We perform extensive simulation studies of the proposed algorithm. While indicating the superior performance of polarization constraint based imaging, the obtained results also highlight the importance of calibrating for direction-dependent effects as well as for off-diagonal terms (denoting polarization leakage) in the associated Jones matrices, without inclusion of which the imaging quality deteriorates.",2019,[],5

The observed spectrum is consistent with AMS-02 but extends to nearly an order of magnitude higher energy, showing a very smooth transition of the power-law spectral index from -2.81 - 0.03 (50--500 GeV) neglecting solar modulation effects (or -2.87 - 0.06 including solar modulation effects in the lower energy region) to -2.56 - 0.04 (1--10 TeV), thereby confirming the existence of spectral hardening and providing evidence of a deviation from a single power law by more than 3 sigma.",2019,[],5

Our 21 confirmed members have a systemic velocity of equation kmsequation and a velocity dispersion equation kmsequation. From the strength of the Ca II triplet, we obtain a metallicity of [Fe/H]= equation dex and dispersion of equation dex. This makes Hercules a particularly metal--poor galaxy, placing it slightly below the standard mass--metallicity relation. Previous photometric and spectroscopic evidence suggests that Hercules is tidally disrupting and may be on a highly radial orbit.

By cross--matching with the second \textitGaia data release, we determine an uncertainty--weighted mean proper motion of equation mas yrequation, equation mas yrequation.

1910.09552,astro-ph,"We present constraints on the formation and evolution of early-type galaxies (ETGs) with the empirical model EMERGE. The parameters of this model are adjusted so that it reproduces the evolution of stellar mass functions, specific star formation rates, and cosmic star formation rates since equation as well as 'quenched' galaxy fractions and correlation functions. We find that at fixed halo mass present-day ETGs are more massive than late-type galaxies, whereas at fixed stellar mass ETGs populate more massive halos in agreement with lensing results. This effect naturally results from the shape and scatter of the stellar-to-halo mass relation and the galaxy formation histories. The ETG stellar mass assembly is dominated by 'in-situ' star formation below a stellar mass of equation and by merging and accretion of 'ex-situ' formed stars at higher mass. The mass dependence is in tension with current cosmological simulations. Lower mass ETGs show extended star formation towards low redshift in agreement with recent estimates from IFU surveys. All ETGs have main progenitors on the 'main sequence of star formation' with the 'red sequence' appearing at equation. Above this redshift, over 95 per cent of the ETG progenitors are star-forming. More than 90 per cent of equation 'main sequence' galaxies with equation evolve into present-day ETGs. Above redshift 6, more than 80 per cent of the observed stellar mass functions above equation can be accounted for by ETG progenitors with equation. This implies that current and future high redshift observations mainly probe the birth of present-day ETGs.

1901.01273,astro-ph,"In the globular cluster NGC2808, a quasi-standard initial lithium abundance is derived for a red giant belonging to the `extreme' population, characterized by a large helium overabundance, and by abundances of proton capture elements typical of nuclear processing in gas at very high temperatures, where the initial lithium has been fully destroyed. The observations of lithium in such extreme cluster stars are important to test different models for the formation of multiple populations in old Globular Clusters. In the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) scenario, fresh lithium is synthetized during the initial phases of hot bottom burning which, afterwards, synthetize the other p-capture elements. We model the abundance of lithium in the ejecta of superAGB models, finding values consistent or larger than observed in the `extreme' giant; these same models describe correctly the magnesium depletion and silicon enrichment of the extreme population of NGC 2808, so the overall agreement provides further support to the AGB scenario. In the models involving massive or supermassive stars, the Lithium observed requires a mixture of the lithium-free ejecta of the polluting population with more than 40% of standard-lithium pristine gas. The extended chemical anomalies of NGC 2808 stars are then to be all explained within at most 60% of the possible dilution range, the initial helium mass fraction in the ejecta should be Y >= 0.5, to account for the Ye 0.38-0.40 of the extreme population, and further observations of p-process elements are needed to check the model.",2019,[],5
1910.01261,astro-ph,"Titan is unique in the solar system as it hosts a dense atmosphere mainly made of Nequation and CHequation. Cassini-Huygens revealed the presence of an intense atmospheric photochemistry initiated by the photo-dissociation and ionization of Nequation and CHequation. In the upper atmosphere, Cassini detected signatures compatible with the presence of heavily charged molecules, precursors for the solid core of the aerosols. However, the processes coupling ion chemistry and aerosol formation and growth are still mostly unknown. In this study, we investigated the cation chemistry responsible for an efficient organic growth that we observe in Titan's upper atmosphere, simulated using the PAMPRE plasma reactor. Cation precursors were measured by in situ ion mass spectrometry in a cold plasma and compared with INMS observations taken during the T40 flyby. A series of positive ion measurements were performed in three CHequation mixing ratios (1%, 5% and 10%) showing a variability in ion population. Low CHequation concentrations result in an abundance of amine cations such as NHequation whereas aliphatic compounds dominate at higher methane concentrations. In conditions of favored tholin production, the presence of C2 compounds such as HCNHequation and CequationHequation is found to be consistent with copolymeric growth structures seen in tholin material. The observed abundance of these two ions particularly in conditions with lower CHequation amounts is consistent with modeling work simulating aerosol growth in Titan's ionosphere, which includes mass exchange primarily between HCNHequation and CequationHequation and negatively charged particles. These results also confirm the prevalent role of C2 cations as precursors to molecular growth and subsequent mass transfer to the charged aerosol particles as the CHequation abundance decreases towards lower altitudes.",2019,[],5

We use large-area surveys with multi-wavelength datasets that include DECam UV-to-optical, VICS82 NIR, Spitzer-IRAC NIR, and Herschel-SPIRE far-infrared/sub-millimeter data. We find that the inclusion of far-infrared/sub-millimeter data leads to SFRs that span equation100-3500 equation and are higher than the extinction-corrected UV-based SFR by an average factor of equation3.5, and by a factor of over 10 in many individual galaxies.

1911.10638,astro-ph,"The mass-loss rates of red supergiant stars (RSGs) are poorly constrained by direct measurements, and yet the subsequent evolution of these stars depends critically on how much mass is lost during the RSG phase. In 2012 the Geneva evolutionary group updated their mass-loss prescription for RSGs with the result that a 20 solar mass star now loses 10x more mass during the RSG phase than in the older models. Thus, higher mass RSGs evolve back through a second yellow supergiant phase rather than exploding as Type II-P supernovae, in accord with recent observations (the so-called ""RSG Problem""). Still, even much larger mass-loss rates during the RSG phase cannot be ruled out by direct measurements of their current dust-production rates, as such mass-loss is episodic. Here we test the models by deriving a luminosity function for RSGs in the nearby spiral galaxy M31 which is sensitive to the total mass loss during the RSG phase. We carefully separate RSGs from asymptotic giant branch stars in the color-magnitude diagram following the recent method exploited by Yang and collaborators in their Small Magellanic Cloud studies. Comparing our resulting luminosity function to that predicted by the evolutionary models shows that the new prescription for RSG mass-loss does an excellent job of matching the observations, and we can readily rule out significantly larger values.",2019,[],5

1910.13333,astro-ph,"We present three-dimensional local hydrodynamic simulations of flows around objects embedded within stellar envelopes using a ""wind tunnel"" formalism. Our simulations model the common envelope dynamical inspiral phase in binary star systems in terms of dimensionless flow characteristics. We present suites of simulations that study the effects of varying the binary mass ratio, stellar structure, equation of state, relative Mach number of the object's motion through the gas, and density gradients across the gravitational focusing scale. For each model, we measure coefficients of accretion and drag experienced by the embedded object. These coefficients regulate the coupled evolution of the object's masses and orbital tightening during the dynamical inspiral phase of the common envelope. We extrapolate our simulation results to accreting black holes with masses comparable to that of the population of LIGO black holes. We demonstrate that the mass and spin accrued by these black holes per unit orbital tightening are directly related to the ratio of accretion to drag coefficients. We thus infer that the mass and dimensionless spin of initially non-rotating black holes change by of order equation and 0.05, respectively, in a typical example scenario. Our prediction that the masses and spins of black holes remain largely unmodified by a common envelope phase aids in the interpretation of the properties of the growing observed population of merging binary black holes. Even if these black holes passed through a common envelope phase during their assembly, features of mass and spin imparted by previous evolutionary epochs should be preserved.",2019,[],5

We combine new deep optical photometry with optical and near-infrared data from the literature to select 1687 member candidates covering a 1.1equation radius area in 25 Ori.

1909.08761,astro-ph,"HI Intensity Mapping (IM) will be used to do precision cosmology using many existing and upcoming radio observatories. The signal will be contaminated due to absorption, the largest component of which will be the flux absorbed by the HI emitting sources themselves from the flux incident on them from background radio continuum sources. We, for the first time, provide a quantitative estimate of the magnitude of the absorbed flux compared to the emitted HI flux for various voxels placed at redshifts between 0.1 and 2.5. We use a cosmological sky simulation of the atomic HI emission line, and sum over the emitted and absorbed fluxes for all sources within voxels at different redshifts. For estimating the absorbed flux we use various relations based on existing observations as well as simulations. We find that for the same co-moving volume of sky, the HI emission falls off quickly with increasing redshift, while the absorption varies much less with redshift and follows the redshift distribution of faint sources that dominate the number counts of radio continuum sources. This results in the fraction of absorption compared to emission to be negligible in the nearby Universe (up to a redshift of ~0.5), increases to about 10% at a redshift of 1, and continues to increase to about 30% up to a redshift of 2.5. These numbers can vary significantly due to the uncertainties on the exact forms of the various relations used, the largest variation being driven by the uncertainty on the number counts of radio continuum sources at sub-mJy flux densities. Absorption of flux incident from background radio continuum sources might become an important contaminant to HI IM signals beyond redshifts of 0.5, and needs to be quantified more accurately using inputs from upcoming deep high resolution surveys of radio continuum sources, HI absorption, and HI emission with the SKA and its precursors.",2019,[],5

A probability function for the detection of radial velocity (RV) variations is used for identifying SB1 candidates. The estimation of orbital parameters for main sequence dwarfs is performed by matching the measured RVs with theoretical velocity curves sampling the orbital parameter space. The method is verified by studying a mock sample from the SB9 catalogue. Studying the boxiness and asymmetry of the spectral lines allows us to identify possible SB2 candidates, while matching their spectra to a synthetic library indicates probable properties of their components.   From the RAVE catalog we select 37,664 stars with multiple RV measurements and identify 3838 stars as SB1 candidates. Joining RAVE and Gaia DR2 yields 450,646 stars with RVs measured by both surveys and 27,716 of them turn out to be SB1 candidates, which is an increase by an order of magnitude over previous studies.

We adopt a simple phenomenological description of the anisotropy, in which the most energetic electrons have a small pitch angle and the least energetic electrons are isotropic, as proposed by Sobacchi \& Lyubarsky (2019). We explore (i) a simple model that assumes a phenomenological shape for the electron energy distribution, and (ii) a self-consistent scheme in which the electrons follow a distribution which is the result of the balance between injection and radiative losses (we include the effects of the anisotropy on the synchrotron cooling rate). Considering the BL Lac object Mkn 421 as representative of the entire class, we show that in both cases the emission can be satisfactorily reproduced under equipartition between the magnetic field and the relativistic electrons. This is in better agreement with the idea that jets are launched as Poynting dominated flows with respect to the standard isotropic scenario, which requires both a low magnetization and a low radiative efficiency to reproduce the observed emission.

At a given stellar mass, the specific star formation rate distribution of the AGN host galaxies remains unchanged with over-density, with the peak of the distribution around the Green Valley. We show that, at a given stellar mass, the AGN fraction that has been commonly used in previous studies (defined as the number of AGNs relative to all galaxies including passive and star forming ones) does decrease with increasing over-density for satellites. This is largely due to the fact that the fraction of passive galaxies strongly depends on environment. In order to investigate the intrinsic correlation between AGN and environment, especially under the assumption that AGN feedback is responsible for star formation quenching, the AGN fraction should be defined as the number of AGNs relative to the star-forming galaxies only. With the new definition, we find little dependence of AGN fraction on over-density, central/satellite, and group halo mass. There is only marginal evidence that AGN may prefer denser regions, which is possibly due to more frequent interaction of galaxies or higher merger rate in groups. Our results support the scenario that internal secular evolution is the predominant mechanism of triggering AGN activity, while external environment related processes only play a minor role.",2019,[],5
1910.09572,astro-ph,"The maximum mass of a neutron star has important implications across multiple research fields, including astrophysics, nuclear physics and gravitational wave astronomy. Compact binary millisecond pulsars (with orbital periods shorter than about a day) are a rapidly-growing pulsar population, and provide a good opportunity to search for the most massive neutron stars. Applying a new method to measure the velocity of both sides of the companion star, we previously found that the compact binary millisecond pulsar PSR J22155135 hosts one of the most massive neutron stars known to date, with a mass of 2.27equation0.16 Mequation (Linares, Shahbaz & Casares, 2018). We reexamine the properties of the 0.33 Mequation companion star, heated by the pulsar, and argue that irradiation in this ""redback"" binary is extreme yet stable, symmetric and not necessarily produced by an extended source. We also review the neutron star mass distribution in light of this and more recent discoveries. We compile a list of all (nine) systems with published evidence for super-massive neutron stars, with masses above 2 Mequation. We find that four of them are compact binary millisecond pulsars (one black widow, two redbacks and one redback candidate). This shows that compact binary millisecond pulsars are key to constraining the maximum mass of a neutron star.",2019,[],5
1908.07781,astro-ph,"Venus shares many similarities with the Earth, but concomitantly, some of its features are extremely original. This is especially true for its atmosphere, where high pressures and temperatures are found at the ground level. In these conditions, carbon dioxide, the main component of Venus' atmosphere, is a supercritical fluid. The analysis of VeGa-2 probe data has revealed the high instability of the region located in the last few kilometers above the ground level. Recent works have suggested an explanation based on the existence of a vertical gradient of molecular nitrogen abundances, around 5 ppm per meter. Our goal was then to identify which physical processes could lead to the establishment of this intriguing nitrogen gradient, in the deep atmosphere of Venus. Using an appropriate equation of state for the binary mixture CO2-N2 under supercritical conditions, and also molecular dynamics simulations, we have investigated the separation processes of N2 and CO2 in the Venusian context. Our results show that molecular diffusion is strongly inefficient, and potential phase separation is an unlikely mechanism. We have compared the quantity of CO2 required to form the proposed gradient with what could be released by a diffuse degassing from a low volcanic activity. The needed fluxes of CO2 are not so different from what can be measured over some terrestrial volcanic systems, suggesting a similar effect at work on Venus.",2019,[],5
1911.00543,astro-ph,"Massive stars are often found in binary systems and it has been argued that binary products boost the ionizing radiation of stellar populations. Accurate predictions for binary products are needed to understand and quantify their contribution to Cosmic Reionization.   We investigate the contribution of stars stripped in binaries since (1) they are, arguably, the best-understood products of binary evolution, (2) we recently produced the first non-LTE radiative transfer calculations for the atmospheres of these stripped stars that predict their ionizing spectra, and (3) they are very promising sources since they boost the ionizing emission of stellar populations at late times. This allows stellar feedback to clear the surroundings such that a higher fraction of their photons can escape and ionize the intergalactic medium.   Combining our detailed predictions for the ionizing spectra with a simple cosmic reionization model, we estimate that stripped stars contributed tens of percent of the photons that caused cosmic reionization of hydrogen, depending on the assumed escape fractions. More importantly, stripped stars harden the ionizing emission. We estimate that the spectral index for the ionizing part of the spectrum can increase to -1 compared to <-2 for single stars. At high redshift, stripped stars and massive single stars combined dominate the HeII-ionizing emission, but we expect active galactic nuclei drive cosmic helium reionization.   Further observational consequences we expect are (1) high ionization states for the intergalactic gas surrounding stellar systems, such as CIV and SiIV and (2) additional heating of the intergalactic medium of up to a few thousand Kelvin. Quantifying these warrants the inclusion of accurate models for stripped stars and other binary products in full cosmological simulations.",2019,[],5
1905.05826,astro-ph,"The fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) states that galaxies of the same stellar mass but larger star formation rate (SFR) tend to have smaller gas-phase metallicity (<Zg>). It is thought to be fundamental because it naturally arises from the stochastic feeding of star-formation from external metal-poor gas accretion, a process extremely elusive to observe but essential according the cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. In this letter, we show how the FMR emerges from the local anti-correlation between SFR surface density and Zg recently observed to exist in disk galaxies. We analytically derive the global FMR from the local law, and then show that both relations agree quantitatively when considering the star-forming galaxies of the MaNGA survey. Thus, understanding the FMR becomes equivalent to understanding the origin of the anti-correlation between SFR and metallicity followed by the set of star-forming regions of any typical galaxy. The correspondence between local and global laws is not specific of the FMR, so that a number of local relations should exist associated with known global relations.",2019,[],5
1902.01345,astro-ph,"Dense stellar clusters are natural sites for the origin and evolution of exotic objects such as relativistic binaries (potential gravitational wave sources), blue stragglers, etc. We investigate the secular dynamics of a binary system driven by the global tidal field of an axisymmetric stellar cluster in which the binary orbits. In a companion paper (Hamilton & Rafikov 2019a) we developed a general Hamiltonian framework describing such systems. The effective (doubly-averaged) Hamiltonian derived there encapsulates all information about the tidal potential experienced by the binary in its orbit around the cluster in a single parameter equation. Here we provide a thorough exploration of the phase-space of the corresponding secular problem as equation is varied. We find that for equation the phase-space structure and the evolution of binary orbital element are qualitatively similar to the Lidov-Kozai problem. However, this is only one of four possible regimes, because the dynamics are qualitatively changed by bifurcations at equation. We show how the dynamics are altered in each regime and calculate characteristics such as secular evolution timescale, maximum possible eccentricity, etc. We verify the predictions of our doubly-averaged formalism numerically and find it to be very accurate when its underlying assumptions are fulfilled, typically meaning that the secular timescale should exceed the period of the binary around the cluster by equation (depending on the cluster potential and binary orbit). Our results may be relevant for understanding the nature of a variety of exotic systems harboured by stellar clusters.",2019,[],5

One key pathway is to study exoplanets as they form in their young (equationfew~Myr) natal disks. Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) such as GMT, TMT, or ELT, can be used to establish the initial chemical conditions, locations, and timescales of planet formation, via (1)~measuring the physical and chemical conditions in protoplanetary disks using infrared spectroscopy and (2)~studying planet-disk interactions using imaging and spectro-astrometry. Our current knowledge is based on a limited sample of targets, representing the brightest, most extreme cases, and thus almost certainly represents an incomplete understanding. ELTs will play a transformational role in this arena, thanks to the high spatial and spectral resolution data they will deliver.

Their relativistically boosted emission extends from radio frequencies to TeV energies. They are also suspected to be the sources of energetic neutrinos and high energies cosmic rays. The study of their overall spectrum indicates that most of the emission of powerful blazars is in hard X-rays or in soft gamma-rays. In this band we can find the most powerful jets, visible also at high redshifts.

1910.06330,astro-ph,"Dust plays an important role in shaping a galaxy's spectral energy distribution (SED). It absorbs ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR) radiation and re-emits this energy in the far-infrared (FIR). The FIR is essential to understand dust in galaxies. However, deep FIR observations require a space mission, none of which are still active today. We aim to infer the FIR emission across six Herschel bands, along with dust luminosity, mass, and effective temperature, based on the available UV to mid-infrared (MIR) observations. We also want to estimate the uncertainties of these predictions, compare our method to energy balance SED fitting, and determine possible limitations of the model. We propose a machine learning framework to predict the FIR fluxes from 14 UV-MIR broadband fluxes. We used a low redshift sample by combining DustPedia and H-ATLAS, and extracted Bayesian flux posteriors through SED fitting. We trained shallow neural networks to predict the far-infrared fluxes, uncertainties, and dust properties. We evaluated them on a test set using a root mean square error (RMSE) in log-space. Our results (RMSE = 0.19 dex) significantly outperform UV-MIR energy balance SED fitting (RMSE = 0.38 dex), and are inherently unbiased. We can identify when the predictions are off, for example when the input has large uncertainties on WISE 22, or when the input does not resemble the training set. The galaxies for which we have UV-FIR observations can be used as a blueprint for galaxies that lack FIR data. This results in a 'virtual FIR telescope', which can be applied to large optical-MIR galaxy samples. This helps bridge the gap until the next FIR mission.",2019,[],5
1902.10149,astro-ph,"We propose a new, likelihood-free approach to inferring the primordial matter power spectrum and cosmological parameters from arbitrarily complex forward models of galaxy surveys where all relevant statistics can be determined from numerical simulations, i.e. black-boxes. Our approach, which we call simulator expansion for likelihood-free inference (SELFI), builds upon approximate Bayesian computation using a novel effective likelihood, and upon the linearisation of black-box models around an expansion point. Consequently, we obtain simple ""filter equations"" for an effective posterior of the primordial power spectrum, and a straightforward scheme for cosmological parameter inference. We demonstrate that the workload is computationally tractable, fixed a priori, and perfectly parallel. As a proof of concept, we apply our framework to a realistic synthetic galaxy survey, with a data model accounting for physical structure formation and incomplete and noisy galaxy observations. In doing so, we show that the use of non-linear numerical models allows the galaxy power spectrum to be safely fitted up to at least equation equation/Mpc, outperforming state-of-the-art backward-modelling techniques by a factor of equation in the number of modes used. The result is an unbiased inference of the primordial matter power spectrum across the entire range of scales considered, including a high-fidelity reconstruction of baryon acoustic oscillations. It translates into an unbiased and robust inference of cosmological parameters. Our results pave the path towards easy applications of likelihood-free simulation-based inference in cosmology.

We explore the possibility that SMBH form from the coherent waves of Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) which are supposed to form the dark matter. We first study the isotropic and anisotropic collapses of BEC. We find the BEC wave can easily collapse to form SMBH but the realistic amount of angular momentum completely prevents the collapse. We further explore the Axion case with attractive interaction and find the moderate mass ratio between the SMBH and the dark halo around it. We also obtain the mass distribution function of BH within a single galaxy.,2019,[],5

This is especially true for NASA's TESS mission which generates thousands of new candidates each month. Here we created the first deep learning model capable of classifying TESS planet candidates. We adapted the neural network model of Ansdell et al. (2018) to TESS data. We then trained and tested this updated model on 4 sectors of high-fidelity, pixel-level simulations data created using the Lilith simulator and processed using the full TESS SPOC pipeline. We find our model performs very well on our simulated data, with 97% average precision and 92% accuracy on planets in the 2-class model. This accuracy is also boosted by another ~4% if planets found at the wrong periods are included. We also performed 3- and 4-class classification of planets, blended & target eclipsing binaries, and non-astrophysical false positives, which have slightly lower average precision and planet accuracies, but are useful for follow-up decisions.

1903.11234,astro-ph,"We present the results from ALMA observations of [NII]205 micron, [CII]158 micron, and [OII]88 micron lines in an unlensed submillimeter galaxy at z=4.3, COSMOS-AzTEC-1, hosting a compact starburst core with an effective radius of 1 kpc. The [CII] and [NII] emission are spatially-resolved in 0.3 arcsec-resolution (1 kpc in radius). The kinematic properties of the [NII] emission are consistent with those of the CO(4-3) and [CII] emission, suggesting that the ionized gas feels the same gravitational potential as the associated molecular gas and photodissociation regions (PDRs). On the other hand, the spatial extent is different among the lines and dust continuum: the [CII] emitting gas is the most extended and the dust is the most compact, leading to a difference of the physical conditions in the interstellar medium. We derive the incident far-ultraviolet flux and the hydrogen gas density through PDR modeling by properly subtracting the contribution of ionized gas to the total [CII] emission. The observed [CII] emission is likely produced by dense PDRs with nH(PDR)=10(5.5-5.75) cm-3 and G0=10(3.5-3.75) in the central 1 kpc region and nH(PDR)=10(5.0-5.25) cm-3 and G0=10(3.25-3.5) in the central 3 kpc region. We have also successfully measured the line ratio of [OIII/[NII] in the central 3 kpc region of COSMOS-AzTEC-1 at z=4.3, which is the highest redshift where both nitrogen and oxygen lines are detected.

We obtained the first interferometric observations for the eclipsing systems AI Phe, AL Dor, KW Hya, NN Del, equation Cen and V4090 Sgr with the VLTI/PIONIER combiner, which we combined with radial velocity measurements to derive their three-dimensional orbit, masses, and distance. Results. We determined very precise stellar masses for all systems, ranging from 0.04% to 3.3 % precision level. We combined these measurements with stellar effective temperature and linear radius to fit stellar isochrones models and determined the age of the systems. We also derived the distance to the systems with a precision level as high as 0.4%. Conclusions. The comparison of theoretical models with stellar parameters shows that stellar models are still deficient in simultaneously fitting the stellar parameters (Teff , R and M) with such level of precision on individual masses.

Post-outburst evolution demonstrated that V1309 Sco was unlike the typical Classical Novae and Symbiotic Recurrent Novae with significant dust production around it, and indicated that the system may become a post-AGB (or pre-PN) soon.

Our main result shows that a correct modelling of RSD is crucial not to bias cosmological parameter estimation. This happens not only for spectroscopy-detected galaxies, but even in the case of galaxy surveys with photometric redshift estimates. Moreover, a correct implementation of RSD is especially valuable in alleviating the degeneracy between the amplitude of the underlying matter power spectrum and the galaxy bias.

1912.00057,astro-ph,"Jet opening angles of long gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs) appear to evolve in cosmic time, with lGRBs at higher redshifts being on average more narrowly beamed than those at lower redshifts. We examine the nature of this anti-correlation in the context of collimation by the progenitor stellar envelope. First, we show that the data indicate a strong correlation between gamma-ray luminosity and jet opening angle, and suggest this is a natural selection effect - only the most luminous GRBs are able to successfully launch jets with large opening angles. Then, by considering progenitor properties expected to evolve through cosmic time, we show that denser stars lead to more collimated jets; we argue that the apparent anti-correlation between opening angle and redshift can be accounted for if lGRB massive star progenitors at high redshifts have higher average density compared to those at lower redshifts. This may be viable for an evolving IMF - under the assumption that average density scales directly with mass, this relationship is consistent with the form of the IMF mass evolution suggested in the literature. The jet angle-redshift anti-correlation may also be explained if the lGRB progenitor population is dominated by massive stars at high redshift, while lower redshift lGRBs allow for a greater diversity of progenitor systems (that may fail to collimate the jet as acutely). Overall, however, we find both the jet angle-redshift anti-correlation and jet angle-luminosity correlation are consistent with the conditions of jet launch through, and collimation by, the envelope of a massive star progenitor.",2019,[],5

Using PixeLens, we also succeed in setting up a global free-form mass density reconstruction including all subcomponents as constraints. We compare the model-independent local lens properties with those obtained by PixeLens and those obtained by the parametric modelling algorithm Lensmodel. A comparison of all three approaches and a model-free analysis based on the relative polar angles of the multiple images corroborate the hypothesis that elliptically symmetric models are too simplistic to characterise the asymmetric mass density distribution of this lenticular or late-type galaxy. In addition, the model-independent approach efficiently determines local lens properties on the scale of the quasar subcomponents, which are computationally intensive to obtain by free-form model-based approaches. As only 40% of the small-scale subcomponent local lens properties overlap within the 1-equation confidence bounds, mass density gradients on milli-arcsecond scales cannot be excluded.

These data, however, only provide information on the surface magnetic field emerging in sunspots, while a suitable proxy of the evolution of the bright magnetic features, specifically faculae/plage and network, is missing. This information can potentially be extracted from the historical full-disc observations in the Ca II K line. We have analysed over 100,000 historical images from 8 digitised photographic archives of the Arcetri, Kodaikanal, McMath-Hulbert, Meudon, Mitaka, Mt Wilson, Schauinsland, and Wendelstein observatories, as well as one archive of modern observations from the Rome/PSPT. The analysed data cover the period 1893--2018. We first performed careful photometric calibration and compensation for the centre-to-limb variation, and then segmented the images to identify plage regions. This has been consistently applied to both historical and modern observations. The plage series derived from different archives are generally in good agreement with each other. However, there are also clear deviations that most likely hint at intrinsic differences in the data and their digitisation. We showed that accurate image processing significantly reduces errors in the plage area estimates. Accurate photometric calibration also allows precise plage identification on images from different archives without the need to arbitrarily adjust the segmentation parameters. Finally, by comparing the plage area series from the various records, we found the conversion laws between them. This allowed us to produce a preliminary composite of the plage areas obtained from all the datasets studied here.

Interestingly, the FP seems incompatible with emission by synchrotron radiation.

However, all attempts to prove that it is a binary have failed because the photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric variations are not coherent over more than a few orbital cycles.   Aims. In this letter we show that the lack of coherence in the variability can be explained with a very rapid apsidal motion in a binary orbit.   Methods. We measured the times of minima in a recently published exceptionally long photometric light curve obtained by the Toronto \emphBRITE satellite. The apsidal motion and the system eccentricity are determined from the length of the time intervals between these minima, which alternate in their duration, following a pattern that is clearly associated with apsidal motion. These minima are superposed on brightness enhancements of the emission from a shock zone, which occur at about the times of periastron phases.   Results. We determine the orbital periodicity, equationd, and the period of the apsidal motion, equationd, which together yield an average sidereal period of equationd. The eccentricity is found to be close to 0.1. The rate of periapsis retreat changes significantly over the period of observation and is determined to be equation at the beginning of the observing period and equation at the end.   Conclusions. We demonstrate that by introducing a fast apsidal motion, the basic photometric variability is very well explained. The binary nature of EZ CMa is now established.

1908.01775,astro-ph,"We perform two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations of cold, dense clouds, which are accelerated by radiation pressure on dust relative to a hot, diffuse background gas. We examine the relative effectiveness of acceleration by ultraviolet and infrared radiation fields, both independently and acting simultaneously on the same cloud. We study clouds that are optically thin to infrared emission but with varying ultraviolet optical depths. Consistent with previous work, we find relatively efficient acceleration and long cloud survival times when the infrared band flux dominates over the ultraviolet flux. However, when ultraviolet is dominant or even a modest percentage (equation\%) of the infrared irradiating flux, it can act to compress the cloud, first crushing it and then disrupting the outer layers. This drives mixing of outer regions of the dusty gas with the hot diffuse background to the point where most dust is not likely to survive or stay coupled to the gas. Hence, the cold cloud is unable to survive for a long enough timescale to experience significant acceleration before disruption even though efficient infrared cooling keeps the majority of the gas close to radiative equilibrium temperature (equationK). We discuss implications for observed systems, concluding that radiation pressure driving is most effective when the light from star-forming regions is efficiently reprocessed into the infrared.",2019,[],5

We adopt first-order corrections on colors and magnitudes to minimize the dispersion between different models by forcing models to match the observed location in the solar-metallicity cluster M67. Even for these calibrated models, however, the internal consistency between models deteriorates at higher metallicities, and photometric masses become smaller than asteroseismic masses, as seen from metal-rich field RC stars with Gaia parallaxes. Similarly, the average photometric mass for metal-rich NGC 6791 stars ranges from equation to equation, depending on the specific set of models employed. An ensemble average of the photometric masses (equation) in NGC 6791 is marginally consistent with the asteroseismic mass (equation). There is a clear tension between the masses that one would predict from photometry for metal-rich field RC stars, asteroseismic masses, and those that would be expected from the ages of stars in the Galactic disk populations and canonical RGB mass loss. We conclude that standard RC models need to be re-examined in light of these powerful new data sets.",2019,[],5
1904.04809,astro-ph,"The magnetic chemically peculiar (Ap/CP2) star 21 Com has been extensively studied in the past, albeit with widely differing and sometimes contradictory results, in particular concerning the occurrence of short term variability between about 5 to 90 minutes. We have performed a new investigation of 21 Com using MOST satellite and high-cadence ground-based photometry, time series spectroscopy, and evolutionary and pulsational modeling. Our analysis confirms that 21 Com is a classical CP2 star showing increased abundances of, in particular, Cr and Sr. From spectroscopic analysis, we have derived Teff = 8900(200) K, log g = 3.9(2), and vsini = 63(2) km/s. Our modeling efforts suggest that 21 Com is a main sequence (MS) star seen equator-on with a mass of 2.29(10) M(Sun) and a radius of R = 2.6(2) R(Sun). Our extensive photometric data confirm the existence of rotational light variability with a period of 2.05219(2) d. However, no significant frequencies with a semi-amplitude exceeding 0.2 mmag were found in the frequency range from 5 to 399 c/d. Our RV data also do not indicate short-term variability. We calculated pulsational models assuming different metallicities and ages, which do not predict the occurrence of unstable modes. The star 18 Com, often employed as comparison star for 21 Com in the past, has been identified as a periodic variable (P = 1.41645 d). While it is impossible to assess whether 21 Com has exhibited short-term variability in the past, the new observational data and several issues/inconsistencies identified in previous studies strongly suggest that 21 Com is neither a delta Scuti nor a roAp pulsator but a ""well-behaved"" CP2 star exhibiting its trademark rotational variability.",2019,[],5
1903.11145,astro-ph,"Astrometry, the measurement of positions and motions of the stars, is one of the oldest disciplines in Astronomy, extending back at least as far as Hipparchus' discovery of the precession of Earth's axes in 190 BCE by comparing his catalog with those of his predecessors. Astrometry is fundamental to Astronomy, and critical to many aspects of Astrophysics and Geodesy. In order to understand our planet's and solar system's context within their surroundings, we must be able to to define, quantify, study, refine, and maintain an inertial frame of reference relative to which all positions and motions can be unambiguously and self-consistently described. It is only by using this inertial reference frame that we are able to disentangle our observations of the motions of celestial objects from our own complex path around our star, and its path through the galaxy, and the local group. Every aspect of each area outlined in the call for scientific frontiers in astronomy in the era of the 2020-2030 timeframe will depend on the quality of the inertial reference frame. In this white paper, we propose support for development of radio Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) capabilities, including the Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA), a radio astronomy observatory that will not only support development of a next generation reference frame of unprecedented accuracy, but that will also serve as a highly capable astronomical instrument in its own right. Much like its predecessors, the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and other VLBI telescopes, the proposed ngVLA will provide the foundation for the next three decades for the fundamental reference frame, benefitting astronomy, astrophysics, and geodesy alike.",2019,[],5
1908.06826,astro-ph,"PKS 2023-07 is a flat spectrum radio quasar located at a redshift equation, farther than any source currently detected at very high energies (equation GeV). At such energies, absorption by the extragalactic background light (EBL) renders the detection of distant sources particularly challenging. The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) observed the source following reports from AGILE (April 2016) and Fermi-LAT (April 2016, September and October 2017) on high-flux states in gamma rays. During each of the three flaring periods, near-simultaneous observations were obtained with H.E.S.S., Fermi-LAT and multiple telescopes at other wavelengths. Though the source was not significantly detected by H.E.S.S., upper limits were derived for each observation period. Through constraints given by Fermi-LAT in the MeV--GeV domain and differential upper limits by H.E.S.S., we searched for an intrinsic cutoff in the EBL-corrected gamma ray spectrum of PKS 2023-07.",2019,[],5
1901.05500,astro-ph,"Long gamma-ray bursts mark the death of massive stars, as revealed by their association with energetic broad-lined stripped-envelope supernovae. The scarcity of nearby events and the brightness of the GRB afterglow, dominating the first days of emission, have so far prevented the study of the very early stages of the GRB-SN evolution. Here we present detailed, multi-epoch spectroscopic observations of SN 2017iuk, associated with GRB 171205A which display features at extremely high expansion velocities of equation 100,000 km sequation within the first day after the burst. These high-velocity components are characterized by chemical abundances different from those observed in the ejecta of SN 2017iuk at later times. Using spectral synthesis models developed for the SN 2017iuk, we explain these early features as originating not from the supernova ejecta, but from a hot cocoon generated by the energy injection of a mildly-relativistic GRB jet expanding into the medium surrounding the progenitor star. This cocoon becomes rapidly transparent and is outshone by the supernova emission which starts dominating three days after the burst. These results proves that the jet plays an important role not only in powering the GRB event but also its associated supernova.",2019,[],5
1904.08367,astro-ph,"The dynamics of active region (AR) 12673 is qualitatively studied using observational data obtained with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager of the Solar Dynamics Observatory on August 31--September 8, 2017. This AR was remarkable for its complex structure and extraodinary flare productivity. The sunspot group in this AR consisted of (1) an old, well-developed and highly stable, coherent sunspot, which had also been observed two solar rotations earlier, and (2) a rapidly developing cluster of umbral and penumbral fragments. Cluster (2) formed two elongated, arc-shaped chains of spot elements, skirting around the major sunspot (1), with two chains of magnetic elements spatially coinciding with the arcs. AR components (1) and (2) were in relative motion, cluster (2) overtaking spot (1), and their relative velocity agrees in order of magnitude with the velocity jump over the near-surface shear layer, or leptocline. The pattern of motion of the features about the main spot bears amazing resemblance to the pattern of a fluid flow about a roundish body. This suggests that spot (1) was dynamically coupled with the surface layers, while cluster (2) developed in deeper layers of the convection zone. The magnetic-flux emergence in cluster (2) appeared to be associated with fluid motions similar to roll convection. The mutual approach of components (1) and (2) gave rise to lights bridges in the umbrae of sunspots with the magnetic field having the same sign on both sides of the bridge.",2019,[],5
1904.09129,astro-ph,"The double red clumps (DRCs) are now dominantly believed to be the strong observational line of evidence of the so-called X-shaped Galactic bar structures. Recently, Lee et al. reported a subtle mean \ds\ difference between the DRCs and suggested a dichotomic picture that can be seen in globular clusters: the faint red clump is the first generation, while the bright red clump corresponds to the second generation (SG). They argued that the magnitude difference between the DRCs is due to different stellar populations, and is not due to the geometric difference between the DRCs. Our reanalysis shows that their data do not appear to support the idea of the multiple population-induced DRCs in our Galactic bulge. We perform fully empirical Monte Carlo simulations and find that the shape of the \ds\ distributions is the most stringent evidence to pursue. Our results strongly suggest that the CN distributions toward the Galactic bulge are qualitatively consistent with the X-shaped Galactic bulge with a minor fraction of the SG of about 2 -- 3\%.",2019,[],5
1907.02082,astro-ph,"We study the galactic bulges in the Auriga simulations, a suite of thirty cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations of late-type galaxies in Milky Way-sized dark matter haloes performed with the moving-mesh code AREPO. We aim to characterize bulge formation mechanisms in this large suite of galaxies simulated at high resolution in a fully cosmological context. The bulges of the Auriga galaxies show a large variety in their shapes,sizes and formation histories. According to observational classification criteria, such as Sersic index and degree of ordered rotation, the majority of the Auriga bulges can be classified as pseudo-bulges, while some of them can be seen as composite bulges with a classical component; however, none can be classified as a classical bulge. Auriga bulges show mostly an in-situ origin, 21 percent of them with a negligible accreted fraction (facc < 0.01). In general,their in-situ component was centrally formed, with 75 percent of the bulges forming most of their stars inside the bulge region at z=0. Part of their in-situ mass growth is rapid and is associated with the effects of mergers, while another part is more secular in origin. In 90 percent of the Auriga bulges, the accreted bulge component originates from less than four satellites.We investigate the relation between the accreted stellar haloes and the bulges of the Auriga simulations. The total bulge mass shows no correlation with the accreted stellar halo mass, as in observations. However, the accreted mass of bulges tends to correlate with their respective accreted stellar halo mass.",2019,[],5

Combined with a measurement of the Einstein radius equation from finite-source effects during the caustic crossings, these measurements imply masses of the host equation and planet equation, system distance equation and projected separation equation.

1912.09483,astro-ph,"Simulations of ultralight, equation, bosonic dark matter exhibit rich wave-like structure, including a soliton core within a surrounding halo that continuously self-interferes on the de Broglie scale. We show here that as an inherent consequence, the soliton undergoes a confined random walk at the base of the halo potential. This is significant for the fate of the ancient central star cluster in Eridanus II, as the agitated soliton gravitationally shakes the star cluster in and out of the soliton on a time scale of equation, so complete tidal disruption of the star cluster can occur within equation. This destructive effect can be mitigated by tidal stripping of the halo of Eridanus II, thereby reducing the agitation, depending on its orbit around the Milky Way. Our simulations show the Milky Way tide affects the halo much more than the soliton, so the star cluster in Eridanus II can survive for over equation within the soliton if it formed after significant halo stripping.",2019,[],5
1908.06120,astro-ph,"The Carnegie-Chicago Hubble Program (CCHP) is building a direct path to the Hubble constant (H0) using Population II stars as the calibrator of the SN Ia-based distance scale. This path to calibrate the SN Ia is independent of the systematics in the traditional Cepheid-based technique. In this paper, we present the distance to M101, the host to SN2011fe, using the I-band tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) based on observations from the ACS/WFC instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope. The CCHP targets the halo of M101 where there is little to no host-galaxy dust, the red giant branch is isolated from nearly all other stellar populations, and there is virtually no source confusion or crowding at the magnitude of the tip. Applying the standard procedure for the TRGB method from the other works in the CCHP series, we find a foreground-extinction-corrected M101 distance modulus of letter0=29.07/-0.04(stat)/-0.05(sys) mag, which corresponds to a distance of D=6.52/-0.12(stat)/-0.15(sys) Mpc. This result is consistent with several recent Cepheid-based determinations, suggesting agreement between Population I and II distance scales for this nearby SN Ia-host galaxy. We further analyze four archival datasets for M101 that have targeted its outer disk to argue that targeting in the stellar halo provides much more reliable distance measurements from the TRGB method due to the combination of multiple structural components and heavily population contamination. Application of the TRGB in complex regions will have sources of uncertainty not accounted for in commonly used uncertainty measurement techniques.",2019,[],5
1911.04197,astro-ph,"The paper presents results of a search for helioseismic events (sunquakes) produced by M-X class solar flares during Solar Cycle 24. The search is performed by analyzing photospheric Dopplergrams from Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI). Among the total number of 500 M-X class flares, 94 helioseismic events were detected. Our analysis has shown that many strong sunquakes were produced by solar flares of low M class (M1-M5), while in some powerful X-class flares helioseismic waves were not observed or were weak. Our study also revealed that only several active regions were characterized by the most efficient generation of helioseismic waves during flares. We found that the sunquake power correlates with the maximum value of the soft X-ray flux time derivative better than with the X-ray class, indicating that the sunquake mechanism is associated with high-energy particles. We also show that the seismically active flares are more impulsive than the flares without helioseismic perturbations. We present a new catalog of helioseismic solar flares, which opens opportunities for performing statistical studies to better understand the physics of sunquakes as well as the flare energy release and transport.",2019,[],5
1911.05948,astro-ph,"The evolution of neutron star (NS) magnetic field (B-field) has long been an important topic, which is still not yet settled down. Here, we analyze the NS B-fields inferred by the cyclotron resonance scattering features (CRSFs) for the high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) and by the magnetic dipole model for the spin-down pulsars. We find that the B-fields of both the 32 NSHMXBs and 28 young pulsars with the supernova remnants follow the log-normal distributions, with the average values of 3.4 * 1012 G and 4.1 * 1012 G respectively, which are further verified to come from the same continuous distribution by the statistical tests. These results declaim that the two methods of measuring NS B-fields are reliable for the above two groups of samples. In addition, since the NS-HMXBs have experienced the spin-down phase as the normal pulsars without accretion and then the spin-up phase by accretion, their ages should be about million years (Myrs). Our statistical facts imply that the B-fields of NS-HMXBs have little decayed in their non-accretion spin-down phases of ~ Myrs, as well as in their accretion phases of ~ 0.1Myrs.",2019,[],5

At the inner Lindblad resonance, orbits are significantly chaotic although far from ergodic, and each orbit explores a small range of tori obtained by torus mapping.",2019,[],5
1908.11119,astro-ph,"Bars strongly influence the distribution of gas and stars within the central regions of their host galaxies. This is particularly pronounced in the star formation desert (SFD) which is defined as two symmetrical regions either side of the bar that show a deficit in young stars. Previous studies proposed that, if star formation is truncated because of the influence of the bar, then the age distribution of stars within the SFD could be used to determine the epoch of bar formation. To test this, we study the properties of SFDs in 6 galaxies from zoom-in cosmological re-simulations. Age maps reveal old regions on both sides of the bars, with a lack of stars younger than 10 Myr, confirming the SFD phenomenon. Local star formation is truncated in the SFDs because after the bar forms, gas in these regions is removed on 1 Gyr timescales. However, the overall age distribution of stars in the SFD does not show a sharp truncation after bar formation but rather a gradual downturn in comparison to that of the bar. This more subtle signature may still give information on bar formation epochs in observed galaxies, but the interpretation will be more difficult than originally hoped. The gradual drop in the SFD age distribution, instead of a truncation, is due to radial migration of stars born in the disk. The SFD is thus one of the only regions where an uncontaminated sample of stars only affected by radial migration can be studied.",2019,[],5

1906.12347,astro-ph,"A significant tension has become manifest between the current expansion rate of our Universe measured from the cosmic microwave background by the Planck satellite and from local distance probes, which has prompted for interpretations of that as evidence of new physics. Within conventional cosmology a likely source of this discrepancy is identified here as a matter density fluctuation around the cosmic average of the 40 Mpc environment in which the calibration of Supernovae Type Ia separations with Cepheids and nearby absolute distance anchors is performed. Inhomogeneities on this scale easily reach 40% and more. In that context, the discrepant expansion rates serve as evidence of residing in an underdense region of equation. The probability for finding this local expansion rate given the Planck data lies at the 95% confidence level. Likewise, a hypothetical equivalent local data set with mean expansion rate equal to that of Planck, while statistically favoured, would not gain strong preference over the actual data in the respective Bayes factor. These results therefore suggest borderline consistency between the local and Planck measurements of the Hubble constant. Generally accounting for the environmental uncertainty, the local measurement may be reinterpreted as a constraint on the cosmological Hubble constant of equation km/s/Mpc. The current simplified analysis may be augmented with the employment of the full available data sets, an impact study for the immediate equation Mpc environment of the distance anchors, more prone to inhomogeneities, as well as expansion rates measured by quasar lensing, gravitational waves, currently limited to the same 40 Mpc region, and local galaxy distributions.",2019,[],5
1906.00113,astro-ph,"The origin of the arc-shaped Sh2-296 nebula is still unclear. Mainly due to its morphology, the nebula has been suggested to be a 0.5 Myr-old supernova remnant (SNR) that could be inducing star formation in the CMa OB1 association. We aim to show, for the first time, that the nebula is part of a large, shell-like structure, which we have designated the 'CMa shell', enclosing a bubble created by successive supernova (SN) explosions. We identified three runaway stars, associated with bow-shock structures, in the direction of the CMa shell and we investigate the possibility that they have originated in the center of the shell. By analyzing images of the CMa OB1 association at several wavelengths, we clearly see that the Sh2-296 nebula is in fact part of a large structure, which can be approximated by a large (with a diameter of ~60 pc) elliptical shell. Using the recent Gaia-DR2 astrometric data, we trace back the path of the three runaway stars, in order to find their original position in the past, with relation to the CMa shell. We also revise the heating and ionization of the Sh2-296 nebula, by comparing the photon budget provided by the O stars in the region with results from radio observations. We find that the runaway stars have likely been ejected from a Trapezium-like progenitor cluster on three successive SN explosions having taken place ~6, ~2 and ~1 Myr ago. We also show that the few late-type O stars in the region cannot explain the ionization of the Sh~2-296 nebula and other mechanisms need to be at work. We argue that, though we now have evidence for several SNe events in the CMa OB1 association, the SNe probably played a minor role in triggering star formation in these clouds. In contrast, the CMa OB1 association, as it is now, likely testifies to the last stages of a star-forming region.",2019,[],5

Observations of AGN feedback are described, together with the suspected responsible mechanisms. Molecular outflows are frequently detected in active galaxies with ALMA and NOEMA, with loading factors between 1 and 5. When driven by AGN with escape velocity, these outflows are therefore a clear way to moderate or suppress star formation. Molecular disks, or tori, are detected at 10pc-scale, kinematically decoupled from their host disk, with random orientation. They can be used to measure the black hole mass.",2019,[],5
1901.04888,astro-ph,"Protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are characterized by different kinds of gas dynamics and chemistry, which are coupled via ionization, heating and cooling processes, as well as advective and turbulent transport. However, directly coupling gas dynamics with time-dependent chemistry is prohibitively computationally expensive when using comprehensive chemical reaction networks. In this paper, we evaluate the utility of a species-based network reduction method in different disk environments to produce small chemical networks that reproduce the abundances of major species found in large gas-phase chemistry networks. We find that the method works very well in disk midplane and surfaces regions, where approximately 20-30 gas phase species, connected by equation50-60 gas phase reactions, are sufficient to reproduce the targeted ionization fraction and chemical abundances. Most species of the reduced networks, including major carriers of oxygen, carbon and nitrogen, also have similar abundances in the reduced and complete network models. Our results may serve as an initial effort for future hydrodynamic/magnetohydrodynamic simulations of PPDs incorporating time-dependent chemistry in appropriate regions. Accurately modeling the abundances of major species at intermediate disk heights, however, will require much more extended network incorporating gas-grain chemistry and are left for future studies.",2019,[],5

The Ivuna meteorite, type specimen for the CI chondrites, is the largest twentieth-century CI fall and least affected by terrestrial alteration. The main mass of Ivuna (BM2008 M1) has been stored in a nitrogen atmosphere at least since 2008 and is the most pristine CI chondrite stone. We report the mineralogy, petrography and bulk elemental composition of BM2008 M1 and a second Ivuna stone (BM1996 M4) stored in air. Both Ivuna stones are breccias consisting of multiple rounded, phyllosilicate-rich clasts formed through aqueous alteration followed by impact processing. A polished thin section of BM2008 M1 analysed immediately after preparation was found to contain sulphate-bearing veins formed when primary sulphides reacted with oxygen and atmospheric water. A section of BM1996 M4 lacked veins but had sulphate grains on the surface recently formed (last 6 years). Differences in the extent of terrestrial alteration recorded by BM2008 M1 and BM1996 M4 probably reflect variations in the post-recovery curation history of the stones before entering the NHM collection, and indicate that where possible pristine samples of hydrated carbonaceous should be kept out of the terrestrial environment in a stable environment to avoid modification. The bulk elemental composition of the two Ivuna stones show some variability due to their heterogeneous nature but in general are similar to previous analyses of CI chondrites. We combine our elemental abundances with literature values to calculate a new average composition for the Ivuna meteorite, which is in good agreement with existing compilations of CI chondrites and the most recent solar photospheric abundances.",2019,[],5

We focus on lower main-sequence stars, where other age-dating tools become ineffective. Our age distributions are compared to those derived from asteroseismic and giant samples and solar analogs. We are able to recover gyrochronological ages for old, lower-main-sequence stars, a remarkable improvement over prior work in hotter stars. Under our model assumptions, our ages have a median relative uncertainty of equation, comparable to the age precision inferred for more massive stars using traditional methods. We investigate trends of galactic equation-enhancement with age, finding evidence of a detection threshold between the age of the oldest equation-poor stars and that of the bulk equation-rich population. We argue that gyrochronology is an effective tool reaching ages of 10--12 Gyr in K- and early M-dwarfs. Finally, we present the first effort to quantify the impact of detailed abundance patterns on rotational evolution.

For a given scenario (a set of parameters defining the history of mass assembly, the star formation law, the initial mass function...), P\'egase.3 consistently computes the following:   * the star formation, infall, outflow and supernova rates from 0 to 20 Gyr;   * the stellar metallicity, the abundances of main elements in the gas and the composition of dust;   * the unattenuated stellar spectral energy distribution (SED);   * the nebular SED, using nebular continua and emission lines precomputed with code Cloudy (Ferland et al. 2017);   * the attenuation in star-forming clouds and the diffuse interstellar medium, by absorption and scattering on dust grains, of the stellar and nebular SEDs. For this, the code uses grids of the transmittance for spiral and spheroidal galaxies. We precomputed these grids through Monte Carlo simulations of radiative transfer based on the method of virtual interactions;   * the re-emission by grains of the light they absorbed, taking into account stochastic heating.   The main innovation compared to P\'egase.2 is the modeling of dust emission and its evolution. The computation of nebular emission has also been entirely upgraded to take into account metallicity effects and infrared lines.

By construction, the sample boasts a unique degree of homogeneity in terms of optical/UV properties. In the X-rays, only four sources are too faint for a detailed spectral analysis. Neglecting a radio-loud object, the other 25 quasars are, as a whole, the most X-ray luminous ever observed, with rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosities of equation erg/s. The continuum photon index distribution, centred at equation, is in excellent agreement with those in place at lower redshift, luminosity and black-hole mass, confirming the universal nature of the X-ray emission mechanism in quasars. Even so, when compared against the well-known equation correlation, our quasars unexpectedly split into two distinct subsets. About 2/3 of the sources are clustered around the relation with a minimal scatter of 0.1 dex, while the remaining 1/3 appear to be X-ray underluminous by factors of equation. Such a large incidence (equation) of X-ray weakness has never been reported in radio-quiet, non-BAL quasar samples. Several factors could contribute to enhance the X-ray weakness fraction among our equation blue quasars. However, the X-ray weak objects also have, on average, flatter spectra, with no clear evidence of absorption. Indeed, column densities in excess of a few equation cmequation can be ruled out for most of the sample. We suggest that, at least in some of our X-ray weak quasars, the corona might experience a radiatively inefficient phase due to the presence of a powerful accretion-disc wind, which substantially reduces the accretion rate through the inner disc and so the availability of seed photons for Compton up-scattering.",2019,[],5
1903.00490,astro-ph,"The TESS spacecraft observed the asynchronous polar CD Ind at a two-minute cadence almost continuously for 28 days in 2018, covering parts of 5 consecutive cycles of the system's 7.3-day beat period. These observations provide the first uninterrupted photometry of a full spin-orbit beat cycle of an asynchronous polar. Twice per beat cycle, the accretion flow switched between magnetic poles on the white dwarf, causing the spin pulse of the white dwarf (WD) to alternate between two waveforms after each pole-switch. An analysis of the waveforms suggests that one accretion region is continuously visible when it is active, while the other region experiences lengthy self-eclipses by the white dwarf. We argue that the previously accepted periods for both the binary orbit and the WD spin have been misidentified, and while the cause of this misidentification is a subtle and easily overlooked effect, it has profound consequences for the interpretation of the system's accretion geometry and doubles the estimated time to resynchronization. Moreover, our timings of the photometric maxima do not agree with the quadratic ephemeris from Myers et al. (2017), and it is possible that the optical spin pulse might be an unreliable indicator of the white dwarf's rotation. Finally, we use Doppler tomography of archival time-resolved spectra from 2006 to study the accretion flow. While the accretion flow showed a wider azimuthal extent than is typical for synchronous polars, it was significantly less extended than in the three other asynchronous polars for which Doppler tomography has been reported.",2019,[],5

The 27.9 d long light curve, with 2 min resolution, reveals remarkable changes in the magnetic accretion geometry of the system over the 7.3 d beat period. We have modelled the changes in the optical spin period pulse shape using a cyclotron emission mapping technique. The resulting cyclotron emission maps of the magnetic white dwarf reveal how the accretion geometry changes from single to two pole accretion and back over the beat cycle.

1909.00606,astro-ph,"With the launch of eROSITA (extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array), successfully occurred on 2019 July 13, we are facing the challenge of computing reliable photometric redshifts for 3 million of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) over the entire sky, having available only patchy and inhomogeneous ancillary data. While we have a good understanding of the photo-z quality obtainable for AGN using spectral energy distribution (SED)-fitting technique, we tested the capability of machine learning (ML), usually reliable in computing photo-z for QSO in wide and shallow areas with rich spectroscopic samples. Using MLPQNA as example of ML, we computed photo-z for the X-ray-selected sources in Stripe 82X, using the publicly available photometric and spectroscopic catalogues. Stripe 82X is at least as deep as eROSITA will be and wide enough to include also rare and bright AGNs. In addition, the availability of ancillary data mimics what can be available in the whole sky. We found that when optical, and near- and mid-infrared data are available, ML and SED fitting perform comparably well in terms of overall accuracy, realistic redshift probability density functions, and fraction of outliers, although they are not the same for the two methods. The results could further improve if the photometry available is accurate and including morphological information. Assuming that we can gather sufficient spectroscopy to build a representative training sample, with the current photometry coverage we can obtain reliable photo-z for a large fraction of sources in the Southern hemisphere well before the spectroscopic follow-up, thus timely enabling the eROSITA science return. The photo-z catalogue is released here.",2019,[],5
1902.08436,astro-ph,"We report a detailed study of the pre-eruption activities that led to the occurrence of an M9.0 flare/CME event on 2012 October 20 in NOAA AR 11598. This includes the study of the preceding confined C2.4 flare that occurred on the same AR ~25 minutes earlier. We observed that the M9.0 flare occurred as a consequence of two distinct triggering events well separated in time. The first triggering episode occurred as early as ~20 minutes before the onset of the M9.0 flare, evidenced by the destabilization and rise of a pre-existing filament to a new position of equilibrium at a higher coronal altitude during the decay phase of the C2.4 flare. This brought the system to a magnetic configuration where the establishment of the second triggering event was favorable. The second triggering episode occurred ~17 minutes later, during the early phase of the M9.0 flare, evidenced by the further rise of the filament and successful ejection. The second trigger is followed by a flare precursor phase, characterized by non-thermal emission and the sequential formation of a hot channel as shown by the SDO/AIA DEM (differential emission measure) maps, the RHESSI X-ray images and spectra. These observations are suggestive of magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration that can explain the precursor phase and can be directly related to the formation of the hot channel. We discuss on the triggering mechanisms, their implications during the early and precursor phases and highlight the importance of early activities and preceding small confined flares to understand the initiation of large eruptive flares.",2019,[],5
1908.04203,astro-ph,"We consider string and supergravity motivated scenarios in which moduli fields dominate the energy density of the Universe in a post-inflationary epoch. For the case of a single light modulus it has been shown that considering the evolution of a specific scale from the time of its Hubble crossing during inflation to the present time, a relation can be obtained among the lightest modulus mass, the reheating parameters (equation, equation and equation) and the inflationary observables. By paying closer attention to the role of the equation, we obtain more stringent constraints on the value of the modulus mass and the reheating parameters using the CMB data. Next, the analysis is extended to include features in the inflaton potential as a source of CMB low multipole anomalies, which further constrains the mass of the modulus to be substantially higher than without such a constraint. By both considerations and for several inflation models considered, we find a constraint on the mass of the lightest modulus particle, equation, generically equationGeV, with possible low values equationGeV. While a simplification of the reheating phase is assumed, the bounds are reliably suggestive, and the study may be taken as a demonstration that substantial knowledge about reheating phase buried deep in the early epochs of the Universe is accessible through the use of CMB observables today.",2019,[],5

1904.02280,astro-ph,"Recent studies show that the majority of blue straggler stars (BSSs) in old open clusters are formed through mass transfer from an evolved star onto a main-sequence companion, resulting in a BSS and white dwarf (WD) in a binary system. We present constraints on the mass transfer histories of two BSS-WD binaries in the open cluster NGC 188, using WD temperatures and surface gravities measured with HST COS far-ultraviolet spectroscopy. Adopting a Gaia-based cluster distance of equation pc, we determine that one system, WOCS 4540, formed through Case C mass transfer resulting in a CO-core white dwarf with equation K and a equation, corresponding to a mass of equation equation and a cooling age of equation Myr. The other system, WOCS 5379, formed through Case B mass transfer resulting in a He-core white dwarf with equation K and a equation, corresponding to a mass of equation equation and an age of equation Myr. The WD parameters are consistent across four different cluster distance assumptions. We determine possible progenitor binary systems with a grid of accretion models using MESA, and investigate whether these systems would lead to stable or unstable mass transfer. WOCS 4540 likely resulted from stable mass transfer during periastron passage in an eccentric binary system, while WOCS 5379 challenges our current understanding of the expected outcomes for mass transfer from red giant branch stars. Both systems are examples of the value in using detailed analyses to fine-tune our physical understanding of binary evolutionary processes.",2019,[],5
1910.08208,astro-ph,"The interstellar comet 2I/Borisov bears a strong resemblance to Oort Cloud comets, judging from its appearance in images taken over the first six weeks of observation. To test the proposed affinity in more diagnostic terms, 2I is compared to Oort Cloud comets of similar perihelion distance, near 2 AU. Eight such objects are identified among the cataloged comets whose orbits have been determined with high accuracy. This work focuses on three particular characteristics: the light curve, the geometry of the dust tail, and the dust parameter Afrho. Unlike Oort Cloud comets with perihelia beyond the snow line, Oort Cloud comets with perihelia near 2 AU show strong evidence of the original halo of slowly accelerating, millimeter-sized and larger icy-dust grains only in early tail observations. The dust tail in later images is primarily the product of subsequent, water-sublimation driven activity nearer perihelion but not of activity just preceding observation, which suggests the absence of microscopic-dust ejecta. Comet 2I fits, in broad terms, the properties of the Oort Cloud comets with perihelia near 2 AU and of fairly low activity. Future tests of the preliminary conclusions are proposed.",2019,[],5
1910.05135,astro-ph,"The majority of galaxy group catalogues available in the literature use the popular friends-of-friends algorithm which links galaxies using a linking length. One potential drawback to this approach is that clusters of point can be link with thin bridges which may not be desirable. Furthermore, these algorithms are designed with large-scales galaxy surveys in mind rather than small-scale, local galaxy environments, where attention to detail is important. Here we present a new simple group finder algorithm, TD-ENCLOSER, that finds the group that encloses a target galaxy of interest. TD-ENCLOSER is based on the kernel density estimation method which treats each galaxy, represented by a zero-dimensional particle, as a two-dimensional circular Gaussian. The algorithm assigns galaxies to peaks in the density field in order of density in descending order (""Top Down"") so that galaxy groups ""grow"" around the density peaks. Outliers in under-dense regions are prevented from joining groups by a specified hard threshold, while outliers at the group edges are clipped below a soft (blurred) interior density level. The group assignments are largely insensitive to all free parameters apart from the hard density threshold and the kernel standard deviation, although this is a known feature of density-based group finder algorithms, and operates with a computing speed that increases linearly with the size of the input sample. In preparation for a companion paper, we also present a simple algorithm to select unique representative groups when duplicates occur. TD-ENCLOSER produces results comparable to those from a widely used catalogue, as shown in a companion paper. A smoothing scale of 0.3 Mpc provides the most realistic group structure.",2019,[],5
1909.09673,astro-ph,"Looking at the orbits of small bodies with large semimajor axes, we are compelled to see patterns. Some of these patterns are noted as strong indicators of new or hidden processes in the outer Solar System, others are substantially generated by observational biases, and still others may be completely overlooked. We can gain insight into the current and past structure of the outer Solar System through a careful examination of these orbit patterns. In this chapter, we discuss the implications of the observed orbital distribution of distant trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). We start with some cautions on how observational biases must affect the known set of TNO orbits. Some of these biases are intrinsic to the process of discovering TNOs, while others can be reduced or eliminated through careful observational survey design. We discuss some orbital element correlations that have received considerable attention in the recent literature. We examine the known TNOs in the context of the gravitational processes that the known Solar System induces in orbital distributions. We discuss proposed new elements of the outer Solar System, posited ancient processes, and the types of TNO orbital element distributions that they predict to exist. We conclude with speculation.",2019,[],5
1908.06561,astro-ph,"Results of the spectral analysis for the galaxy cluster IGR J17448-3232 are presented. The intracluster medium (ICM) in the central region (r<300"", 320 kpc) has a high electron temperature plasma of kTe~13-15 keV and an ionization temperature estimated from an intensity ratio of Fe XXVI Ly alpha/Fe XXV He alpha lines is lower than the electron temperature, which suggests that the ICM is in the non-ionization equilibrium (NEI) state. The spectrum in the central region can be also fitted with a two-component model: a two-temperature plasma model in a collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) with temperatures of 7.9 keV and >34 keV or a CIEpower law model with a temperature of 9.4 keV and a photon index of 1.1. The two component models can represent the intensity ratio of Fe XXVI Ly alpha/Fe XXV He alpha lines. On the other hand, the spectrum in the outer region (r>300') can be explained by a single CIE plasma model with a temperature of 5-8 keV. Based on the spectral feature and its circular structure, we propose that the NEI plasma was produced by merging along the line-of-sight direction.",2019,[],5

We combine the TESS photometry with archival HARPS spectra to confirm the planetary nature of the transit signals and derive the masses of the two transiting planets. With an orbital period of 4.8 days, a mass of 7.51(1.09)(-1.01) MEarth, and a radius of 1.64/-0.06 REarth, HD 15337b joins the growing group of short-period super-Earths known to have a rocky terrestrial composition.

The two planets have similar masses and lie on opposite sides of the radius gap, and are thus an excellent testbed for planet formation and evolution theories. Assuming that HD 15337c hosts a hydrogen-dominated envelope, we employ a recently developed planet atmospheric evolution algorithm in a Bayesian framework to estimate the history of the high-energy (extreme ultraviolet and X-ray) emission of the host star.

1905.08333,astro-ph,"Asteroseismology of solar-like oscillators often relies on the comparisons between stellar models and stellar observations in order to determine the properties of stars. The values of the global seismic parameters, equation (the frequency where the smoothed amplitude of the oscillations peak) and equation (the large frequency separation), are frequently used in grid-based modeling searches. However, the methods by which equation is calculated from observed data and how equation is calculated from stellar models are not the same. Typically for observed stars, especially for those with low signal-to-noise data, equation is calculated by taking the power spectrum of a power spectrum, or with autocorrelation techniques. However, for stellar models, the actual individual mode frequencies are calculated and the average spacing between them directly determined. In this work we try to determine the best way to combine model frequencies in order to obtain equation that can be compared with observations. For this we use stars with high signal-to-noise observations from Kepler as well as simulated TESS data of Ball et al. (2018). We find that when determining equation from individual mode frequencies the best method is to use the equation modes with either no weighting or with a Gaussian weighting around equation.",2019,[],5

We found a relationship with linear discriminant analysis between the spectral categories and the model independent physical data. We compared the Swift and Fermi spectral types. We found a connection between the Fermi fluence spectra and the Swift spectra but the result of the peak flux spectra can be disputable.

1910.08687,astro-ph,"The neutrino process (equation-process) for the production of 7Li and 11B in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) is extensively investigated. Initial abundances of s-nuclei and other physical conditions are derived from an updated calculation of the SN 1987A progenitor. The nuclear reaction network including neutrino reactions is constructed with the variable order Bader-Deuflhard integration method. We find that yields of 7Li and 11B significantly depend on the stellar metallicity while they are independent of the weak s-process during the stellar evolution. When the metallicity is high, there are more neutron absorbers, i.e., 56Fe, 14N (from initial CNO nuclei), and 54Fe, and the neutron abundance is small during the equation-process. Since 7Be is predominantly destroyed via 7Be(n,p)7Li, a change in the neutron abundance results in different 7Be yields. Then, the calculated yield ratio 7Li/11B=0.93 for the solar metallicity is larger than that for the SN 1987A 7Li/11B=0.80 by 16 % in the inverted mass hierarchy case.

1904.01703,astro-ph,"Early-type Wolf-Rayet(WR) stellar models harbor a super-Eddington layer in their outer envelopes due to a prominent iron opacity bump. In the past few decades, one-dimensional hydrostatic and time-steady hydrodynamic models have suggested a variety of WR responses to a super-Eddington force including envelope inflation and optically thick winds. In this paper, I study these responses using semianalytical estimates and WR models from both MESA and Ro & Matzner; four conclusions are present. First, early-type WR stars do not harbor inflated envelopes because they have either strong winds or insufficient luminosities. Second, the condition for an opacity bump to harbor a sonic point is expressible as a minimum mass-loss rate, equation. In agreement with Grassitelli et al. and Ro, the majority of galactic early-type WR stars can harbor sonic points at the iron opacity bump. However, about half of those in the Large Magellanic Cloud cannot given typical wind parameters. Third, WR winds driven by the iron opacity bump must have mass-loss rates that exceed a global minimum of equation. Lastly, the observed early-type WR distribution follows a simple mass-loss relation derived here if the radiation-to-gas pressure ratio is approximately equation in the wind; a value consistent with studies by Grafener et al. and Nakauchi & Saio.",2019,[],5
1907.09492,astro-ph,"Abell 2744, a massive Hubble Frontier Fields merging galaxy cluster with many multiple images in the core has been the subject of many lens inversions using different methods. While most existing studies compare various inversion methods, we focus on a comparison of reconstructions that use different input lensing data. Since the quantity and quality of lensing data is constantly improving, it makes sense to ask if the estimated uncertainties are robust against changes in the data. We address this question using free-form Grale, which takes only image information as input, and nothing pertaining to cluster galaxies. We reconstruct Abell 2744 using two sets of strong lensing data from the Hubble Frontier Fields community. Our first and second reconstructions use 55 and 91 images, respectively, and only 10 of the 91 images have the same positions and redshifts as in the first reconstruction. Comparison of the two mass maps shows that Grale uncertainties are robust against these changes, as well as small modifications in the inversion routine. Additionally, applying the methods used in Sebesta et al. (2016) for MACS J0416, we conclude that, in a statistical sense, light follows mass in Abell 2744, with brighter galaxies clustering stronger with the recovered mass than the fainter ones. We also show that the faintest galaxies are anti-correlated with mass, which is likely the result of light contamination from bright galaxies, and lensing magnification bias acting on galaxies background to the cluster.",2019,[],5
1909.06130,astro-ph,"In this paper we report on equation years of observations of PSR J2051equation0827, at radio frequencies in the range 110--4032 MHz. We investigate the eclipse phenomena of this black widow pulsar using model fits of increased dispersion and scattering of the pulsed radio emission as it traverses the eclipse medium. These model fits reveal variability in dispersion features on timescales as short as the orbital period, and previously unknown trends on timescales of months--years. No clear patterns are found between the low-frequency eclipse widths, orbital period variations and trends in the intra-binary material density. Using polarisation calibrated observations we present the first available limits on the strength of magnetic fields within the eclipse region of this system; the average line of sight field is constrained to be equation G equation G, while for the case of a field directed near-perpendicular to the line of sight we find equation G. Depolarisation of the linearly polarised pulses during the eclipse is detected and attributed to rapid rotation measure fluctuations of equation rad mequation along, or across, the line of sights averaged over during a sub-integration. The results are considered in the context of eclipse mechanisms, and we find scattering and/or cyclotron absorption provide the most promising explanation, while dispersion smearing is conclusively ruled out.

1902.02039,astro-ph,"We present a comparative study between the results of most hydrodynamic simulations of the common envelope binary interaction to date and observations of post common envelope binaries. The goal is to evaluate whether this dataset indicates the existence of a formula that may predict final separations of post-common envelope systems as a function of pre-common envelope parameters. Some of our conclusions are not surprising while others are more subtle. We find that: (i) Values of the final orbital separation derived from common envelope simulations must at this time be considered upper limits. Simulations that include recombination energy do not seem to have systematically different final separations; these and other simulations imply equation. At least one simulation, applicable to double-degenerate systems, implies equation. (ii) Despite large reconstruction errors, the post-RGB observations reconstructed parameters are in agreement with some of the simulations. The post-AGB observations behave instead as if they had a systematically lower value of equation. The lack of common envelope simulations with low mass AGB stars leaves us with no insight as to why this is the case. (iii) The smallest mass companion that survives the common envelope with intermediate mass giants is 0.05-0.1~\ms. (iv) Observations of binaries with separations larger than equation10~\rs, tend to have high equation mass ratios and may go through a relatively long phase of unstable Roche lobe mass transfer followed by a weakened common envelope (or with no common envelope at all).

As one enters the Dark Ages (z>30), the Universe becomes pristine. Ground-based low-frequency radio telescopes aim to detect the spatial fluctuations of the 21-cm signal. Complementary, global 21-cm experiments aim to measure the sky-averaged 21-cm signal. Escaping RFI and the ionosphere has motivated space-based missions, such as the Dutch-Chinese NCLE instrument (currently in lunar L2), the proposed US-driven lunar or space-based instruments DAPPER and FARSIDE, the lunar-orbit interferometer DSL (China), and PRATUSH (India). To push beyond the current z~25 frontier, though, and measure both the global and spatial fluctuations (power-spectra/tomography) of the 21-cm signal, low-frequency (1-100MHz; BW~50MHz; z>13) space-based interferometers with vast scalable collecting areas (1-10-100 km2), large filling factors (~1) and large fields-of-view (4pi sr.) are needed over a mission lifetime of >5 years. In this ESA White Paper, we argue for the development of new technologies enabling interferometers to be deployed, in space (e.g. Earth-Sun L2) or in the lunar vicinity (e.g. surface, orbit or Earth-Moon L2), to target this 21-cm signal. This places them in a stable environment beyond the reach of most RFI from Earth and its ionospheric corruptions, enabling them to probe the Dark Ages as well as the Cosmic Dawn, and allowing one to investigate new (astro)physics that is inaccessible in any other way in the coming decades.

We detect four sources at high significance (S/Nequation4.4) with an expected number of false detection of 0.09 sources, and five sources at equationS/Nequation with an expected number of false detection of 1.65 sources. Combined with deep GISMO observations in GOODS-N, we constrain the 2mm number counts over one decade in flux density. These measurements agree with most galaxy evolution models tested here, except those with large population of dusty star-forming galaxies at equation. Five GISMO sources have counterparts in (sub-)millimeter catalogs available in COSMOS. Their redshifts suggest that all but one lie above equation. These four high-redshift (equation) galaxies have equation, SFRs equation400 - 1200Mequationyrequation and equationMequation. They provide a relatively complete selection (equation) of the most luminous (equationLequation) and highest redshift (equation) galaxies detected within our survey area by AzTEC at 1.1mm. We thus conclude that 2mm surveys favor the selection of massive, vigorously star-forming, high-redshift galaxies.

1903.02747,astro-ph,"The preparation of science objectives of the ESA's PLATO space mission will require the implementation of hare-and-hound exercises relying on the massive generation of representative simulated light-curves. We developed a light-curve simulator named the PLATO Solar-like Light-curve Simulator (PSLS) in order to generate light-curves representative of typical PLATO targets, i.e. showing simultaneously solar-like oscillations, stellar granulation, and magnetic activity. At the same time, PSLS also aims at mimicking in a realistic way the random noise and the systematic errors representative of the PLATO multi-telescope concept. To quantify the instrumental systematic errors, we performed a series of simulations at pixel level that include various relevant sources of perturbations expected for PLATO. From the simulated pixels, we extract the photometry as planned on-board. The simulated light-curves are then corrected for instrumental effects using the instrument Point Spread Functions reconstructed on the basis of a microscanning technique that will be operated during the in-flight calibration phases. These corrected light-curves are then fitted by a parametric model, which we incorporated in PSLS. We show that the instrumental systematic errors dominate the signal only at frequencies below 20muHz and are found to mainly depend on stellar magnitude and on the detector charge transfer inefficiency. To illustrate how realistic our simulator is, we compared its predictions with observations made by Kepler on three typical targets and found a good qualitative agreement with the observations. PSLS reproduces the main properties of expected PLATO light-curves. Its speed of execution and its inclusion of relevant stellar signals as well as sources of noises representative of the PLATO cameras make it an indispensable tool for the scientific preparation of the PLATO mission.",2019,[],5
1902.03663,astro-ph,"Weak gravitational lensing is one of the most promising cosmological probes of the late universe. Several large ongoing (DES, KiDS, HSC) and planned (LSST, EUCLID, WFIRST) astronomical surveys attempt to collect even deeper and larger scale data on weak lensing. Due to gravitational collapse, the distribution of dark matter is non-Gaussian on small scales. However, observations are typically evaluated through the two-point correlation function of galaxy shear, which does not capture non-Gaussian features of the lensing maps. Previous studies attempted to extract non-Gaussian information from weak lensing observations through several higher-order statistics such as the three-point correlation function, peak counts or Minkowski-functionals. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) emerged in the field of computer vision with tremendous success, and they offer a new and very promising framework to extract information from 2 or 3-dimensional astronomical data sets, confirmed by recent studies on weak lensing. We show that a CNN is able to yield significantly stricter constraints of (equation) cosmological parameters than the power spectrum using convergence maps generated by full N-body simulations and ray-tracing, at angular scales and shape noise levels relevant for future observations. In a scenario mimicking LSST or Euclid, the CNN yields 2.4-2.8 times smaller credible contours than the power spectrum, and 3.5-4.2 times smaller at noise levels corresponding to a deep space survey such as WFIRST.

The MOXC3 MSFRs are NGC 2264, NGC 6193, RCW 108-IR, Aur OB1, DR15, NGC 6231, Berkeley 87, NGC 6357, AFGL 4029, h Per (NGC 869), NGC 281, Onsala 2S, G305, and RCW 49 (Wd 2); they have distances of 0.7 kpc to 4.2 kpc. Most exhibit clumped or clustered young stellar populations; several contain at least two distinct massive young stellar clusters. The total MOXC3 catalog includes 27,923 X-ray point sources. We take great care to identify even the faintest X-ray point sources across these fields. This allows us to remove this point source light, revealing diffuse X-ray structures that pervade and surround MSFRs, often generated by hot plasmas from massive star feedback. As we found in MOXC1 and MOXC2, diffuse X-ray emission is traceable in all MOXC3 MSFRs; here we perform spectral fitting to investigate the origins of selected diffuse regions. Once again, MOXC3 shows the value of high spatial resolution X-ray studies of MSFRs enabled by Chandra.",2019,[],5
1907.01680,astro-ph,"We determine the inner density profiles of massive galaxy clusters (Mequation > equation Mequation) in the Cluster-EAGLE (C-EAGLE) hydrodynamic simulations, and investigate whether the dark matter density profiles can be correctly estimated from a combination of mock stellar kinematical and gravitational lensing data. From fitting mock stellar kinematics and lensing data generated from the simulations, we find that the inner density slopes of both the total and the dark matter mass distributions can be inferred reasonably well. We compare the density slopes of C-EAGLE clusters with those derived by Newman et al. for 7 massive galaxy clusters in the local Universe. We find that the asymptotic best-fit inner slopes of ""generalized"" NFW (gNFW) profiles, equation, of the dark matter haloes of the C-EAGLE clusters are significantly steeper than those inferred by Newman et al. However, the mean mass-weighted dark matter density slopes of the simulated clusters are in good agreement with the Newman et al. estimates. We also find that the estimate of equation is very sensitive to the constraints from weak lensing measurements in the outer parts of the cluster and a bias can lead to an underestimate of equation.",2019,[],5
1905.10387,astro-ph,We present an unprecedented view on the morphology and kinematics of the extended narrow-line region (ENLR) and molecular gas around the prototypical hyper-luminous quasar 3C273 (equation erg/s at z=0.158) based on VLT-MUSE optical 3D spectroscopy and ALMA observations. We find that: 1) The ENLR size of 12.1equation0.2kpc implies a smooth continuation of the size-luminosity relation out to large radii or a much larger break radius as previously proposed. 2) The kinematically disturbed ionized gas with line splits reaching 1000km/s out to 6.1equation1.5kpc is aligned along the jet axis. 3) The extreme line broadening on kpc scales is caused by spatial and spectral blending of many distinct gas clouds separated on sub-arcsecond scales with different line-of-sight velocities. The ENLR velocity field combined with the known jet orientation rule out a simple scenario of a radiatively-driven radial expansion of the outflow. Instead we propose that a pressurized expanding hot gas cocoon created by the radio jet is impacting on an inclined gas disk leading to transverse and/or backflow motion with respect to our line-of-sight. The molecular gas morphology may either be explained by a density wave at the front of the outflow expanding along the jet direction as predicted by positive feedback scenario or the cold gas may be trapped in a stellar over-density caused by a recent merger event. Using 3C273 as a template for observations of high-redshift hyper-luminous AGN reveals that large-scale ENLRs and kpc scale outflows may often be missed due to the brightness of the nuclei and the limited sensitivity of current near-IR instrumentation.,2019,[],5
1904.07100,astro-ph,"We present imaging and spectroscopic observations of 6478 Gault, a 6 km diameter inner main-belt asteroid currently exhibiting strong, comet-like characteristics. Three distinct tails indicate that ultra-slow dust (ejection speed 0.15/-0.05 m/s) was emitted from Gault in separate episodes beginning UT 2018 October 28/-5 (Tail A), UT 2018 December 31/-5 (Tail B), and UT 2019 February 10/-7, with durations of 10 to 20 days. With a mean particle radius 100 micron, the estimated masses of the tails are MA = 2e7 kg, MB = 3e6 kg and MC = 3e5 kg, respectively, and the mass loss rates from the nucleus are 10 to 20 kg/s for Tail A, 2 to 3 kg/s for Tail B and about 0.2 kg/s for Tail C. In its optical colors Gault is more similar to C-type asteroids than to S-types, even though the latter are numerically dominant in the inner asteroid belt. A spectroscopic upper limit to the production of gas is set at 1 kg/s. Discrete emission in three protracted episodes effectively rules out an impact origin for the observed activity. Sublimation driven activity is unlikely given the inner belt orbit and the absence of detectable gas. In any case, sublimation would not easily account for the observed multiple ejections. The closest similarity is between Gault and active asteroid 311P/(2013 P5), an object showing repeated but aperiodic ejections of dust over a 9 month period. While Gault is 10 times larger than 311P/(2013 P5), and the spin-up time to radiation torques is 100 times longer, its properties are likewise most consistent with episodic emission from a body rotating near breakup.",2019,[],5
1901.10954,astro-ph,"The slow, dense winds observed in evolved asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are usually attributed to a combination of dust formation in the dynamical inner atmosphere and momentum transfer from stellar photons interacting with the newly formed dust particles. Wind models calculated with the DARWIN code, using this mass-loss scenario, have successfully produced outflows with dynamical and photometric properties compatible with observations, for both C-type and M-type AGB stars.

1905.08542,astro-ph,"Preparing for the expected wealth of Gaia detections, we consider here a simple algorithm for classifying unresolved astrometric binaries with main-sequence (MS) primary into three classes: binaries with a probable MS secondary, with two possible values for the mass ratio; probable hierarchical triple MS systems with an astrometric secondary as a close binary, with a limited range of mass-ratio values; and binaries with a compact-object secondary, with a minimal value of the mass ratio. This is done by defining a unit-less observational parameter 'Astrometric Mass-Ratio Function' (AMRF), equation, of a binary, based on primary-mass estimation, in addition to the astrometric parameters - the angular semi-major axis, the period and the parallax. We derive the equation value that differentiates the three classes by forward modeling representative binaries of each class, assuming some mass-luminosity relation.To demonstrate the potential of the algorithm, we consider the orbits of 98 Hipparcos astrometric binaries with main-sequence primaries, using the Hipparcos parallaxes and the primary-mass estimates. For systems with known spectroscopic orbital solution, our results are consistent with the spectroscopic elements, validating the suggested approach. The algorithm will be able to identify hierarchical triple systems and dormant neutron-star and black-hole companions in the Gaia astrometric binaries.",2019,[],5
1910.13591,astro-ph,"Jets from young stellar objects provide insight into the workings of the beating heart at the centre of star forming cores. In some cases, multiple pulsed outflows are detected such as the atomic and molecular jets from a proposed binary system in the T\,Tauri star HH30. We investigate here the development and propagation of duelling atomic and molecular outflows stemming from the two stars in co-orbit. We perform a series of numerical experiments with the \small ZEUS-MP code with enhanced cooling and chemistry modules. The aim of this work is to identify signatures on scales of order 100 AU. The jet sources are off the grid domain and so it is the propagation and interaction from ~ 20AU out to 100\,AU simulated here. We find that the molecular flow from the orbiting source significantly disturbs the atomic jet, deflecting and twisting the jet and disrupting the jet knots. Regions of high ionisation are generated as the atomic jet rams through the dense molecular outflow. Synthetic images in atomic and molecular lines are presented which demonstrate identifying signatures. In particular, the structure within the atomic jet is lost and H-alpha may trace the walls of the present CO cavity or where the walls have been recently. These results provide a framework for the interpretation of upcoming high resolution observations.",2019,[],5
1902.05525,astro-ph,"We introduce our new code MYOSOTIS (Make Your Own Synthetic ObservaTIonS) which is designed to produce synthetic observations from simulated clusters. The code can synthesise observations from both ground- and spaced-based observatories, for a range of different filters, observational conditions and angular/spectral resolution. In this paper, we highlight some of the features of MYOSOTIS, creating synthetic observations from young massive star clusters. Our model clusters are simulated using nbody6 code and have different total masses, half-mass radii, and binary fractions. The synthetic observations are made at the age of 2 Myr with Solar metallicity and under different extinction conditions. For each cluster, we create synthetic images of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the visible (WFPC2/F555W) as well as Very Large Telescopes (VLT) in the nearIR (SPHERE/IRDIS/Ks). We show how MYOSOTIS can be used to look at mass function (MF) determinations. For this aim we re-estimate stellar masses using a photometric analysis on the synthetic images. The synthetic MF slopes are compared to their actual values. Our photometric analysis demonstrate that depending on the adopted filter, extinction, angular resolution and pixel sampling of the instruments, the power-law index of the underlying MFs can be shallower than the observed ones by at least 0.25 dex which is in agreement with the observed discrepancies reported in the literature, specially for young star clusters.",2019,[],5

The measured beam size, aperture efficiency, and main-beam efficiency are derived for the range of observing frequencies (66--116 GHz) within the 3mm atmospheric window. The telescope performs well even at the highest frequencies (>100 GHz). The amount of power in the error pattern of the antenna beam is estimated. Approximately 95% of the total antenna power is contained within 1 degree of the pointed direction. The calibration derived using small sources follows theoretical expectations based on the Ruze equation.

We find that these events are possibly not associated with the Northern Bubble but do not dismiss a possible correlation with the Southern globular structure. We expect in the coming years to improve the gamma-ray observations through the Cerenkov Telescope Array (CTA) and the Southern Gamma-Ray Survey Observatory (SGSO) observatories to test a possible hadronic emission with the Southern Bubble.",2019,[],5
1909.02812,astro-ph,"Hydrodynamical simulations show that a pair of spiral arms can form in the disk around a rapidly-growing young star and that the arms are crucial in transporting angular momentum as the disk accretes material from the surrounding envelope. Here we report the detection of a pair of symmetric spiral structures in a protostellar disk, supporting the formation of spiral arms in the disk around a forming star. The HH 111 VLA 1 source is a young Class I source embedded in a massive infalling protostellar envelope and is actively accreting, driving the prominent HH 111 jet. Previous observations showed a ring of shock emission around the disk's outer edge, indicating accretion of the envelope material onto the disk at a high rate. Now with ALMA observations of thermal emission from dust particles, we detect a pair of spiral arms extending from the inner region to the disk's outer edge, similar to that seen in many simulations. Additionally, the disk is massive, with Toomre's Q parameter near unity in the outer parts where the spiral structures are detected, supporting the notion that envelope accretion is driving the outer disk gravitationally unstable. In our observations, another source, HH 111 VLA 2, is spatially resolved for the first time, showing a disk-like structure with a diameter of ~ 26 au and an orientation nearly orthogonal to that of the HH 111 VLA 1 disk.",2019,[],5
1910.04188,astro-ph,"Spectroscopic studies of low-luminosity early-type galaxies are essential to understand their origin and evolution but remain challenging because of low surface brightness levels.

It targets a representative sample of dwarf elliptical (dE), ultra-diffuse (UDG), and dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. We outline our data analysis approach that features (i) a full spectrophotometric fitting to derive internal kinematics and star formation histories of galaxies; (ii) two-dimensional light profile decomposition; (iii) Jeans anisotropic modelling to assess their internal dynamics and dark matter content. We present first results for 9 UDGs in the Coma cluster and a nearby dSph galaxy, which suggest that a combination of internal (supernovae feedback) and environmental (ram-pressure stripping, interactions) processes can explain observed properties of UDGs and, therefore, establish an evolutionary link between UDGs, dSph, and dE galaxies.",2019,[],5
1905.06699,astro-ph,"Recent balloon-borne and satellite experiments have established new features in the behavior of the spectra of cosmic rays. An analysis of all the data showed that hardening of most abundant primary cosmic ray nuclei spectra with increasing rigidity is observed in equation GV region. At the same time, rigidity dependencies of secondary cosmic rays are distinctly different. The AMS-02 data show that above 200 GV the secondary cosmic rays Li, Be, B harden more than the primary He, C, O.   In this paper we discuss a new scenario that self-consistently describes these new features of the cosmic ray spectra. We demonstrate that the measured by the AMS-02 changes in the slope of the cosmic ray spectra caused by the transition from the contribution of multiple distant Galactic sources, including the nuclear interactions of the particles accelerated by these sources with an interstellar medium during their wandering in the Galaxy, to the contribution of mainly local ones. We also found that the spectral universality is observed at rigidity equation GV.",2019,[],5
1905.06538,astro-ph,"We report the discovery of large-amplitude mid-infrared variabilities (MIR; equation mag) in the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer W1 and W2 bands of the low-luminosity narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy WPVS 007, which exhibits prominent and varying broad-absorption lines (BALs) with blueshifted velocity up to equation. The observed significant MIR variability, the UV to optical color variabilities in the Swift bands that deviate from the predictions of pure dust attenuation models, and the fact that Swift light curves can be well fitted by the stochastic AGN variability model suggest that its observed flux variabilities in UV-optical-MIR bands should be intrinsic, rather than owing to variable dust extinction. Furthermore, the variations of BAL features (i.e., trough strength and maximum velocity) and continuum luminosity are concordant. Therefore, we propose that the BAL variability observed in WPVS 007 is likely induced by the intrinsic ionizing continuum variation, alternative to the rotating-torus model proposed in a previous work. The BAL gas in WPVS 007 might be in the low-ionization state as traced by its weak N V BAL feature; as the ionizing continuum strengthens, the Ci IV and Si IV column densities also increase, resulting in stronger BALs and the emergence of high-velocity components of the outflow. The outflow launch radius might be as small as equation pc under the assumption of being radiatively driven, but a large-scale origin (e.g., torus) cannot be fully excluded because of the unknown effects from additional factors, e.g., the magnetic field.",2019,[],5
1905.04320,astro-ph,"Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) are among the most luminous galaxies in the Universe. Powered by highly obscured, possibly Compton-thick, active galactic nuclei (AGNs), Hot DOGs are characterized by SEDs that are very red in the mid-IR yet dominated by the host galaxy stellar emission in the UV and optical. An earlier study identified a sub-sample of Hot DOGs with significantly enhanced UV emission. One target, W0204-0506, was studied in detail and, based on Chandra observations, it was concluded that the enhanced emission was most likely due to either extreme unobscured star-formation (equation) or to light from the highly obscured AGN scattered by gas or dust into our line of sight. Here, we present a follow-up study of W0204-0506 as well as two more Hot DOGs with excess UV emission. For the two new objects we obtained Chandra/ACIS-S observations, and for all three targets we obtained HST/WFC3 F555W and F160W imaging. We conclude that the excess UV emission is primarily dominated by light from the central highly obscured, hyper-luminous AGN that has been scattered into our line of sight. We cannot rule out, however, that star-formation may significantly contribute to the UV excess of W0204-0506.",2019,[],5
1904.10220,astro-ph,"The unprecedented quality of the data collected by the AMS-02 experiment onboard the International Space Station allowed us to address subtle questions concerning the origin and propagation of cosmic rays. Here we discuss the implications of these data for the injection spectrum of elements with different masses and for the diffusion coefficient probed by cosmic rays through their journey from the sources to the Earth. We find that the best fit to the spectra of primary and secondary nuclei requires (1) a break in the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient at energies equation GV; (2) an injection spectrum that is the same for all nuclei heavier than helium, and different injections for both protons and helium. Moreover, if to force the injection spectrum of helium to be the same as for heavier nuclei, the fit to oxygen substantially worsens. Accounting for a small, equation, grammage accumulated inside the sources leads to a somewhat better fit to the B/C ratio but makes the difference between He and other elements even more evident. The statistic and systematic error bars claimed by the AMS collaboration exceed the error that is expected from calculations once the uncertainties in the cross sections of production of secondary nuclei are taken into account. In order to make this point more quantitative, we present a novel parametrization of a large set of cross sections, relevant for cosmic ray physics, and we introduce the uncertainty in the branching ratios in a way that its effect can be easily grasped.",2019,[],5
1909.00874,astro-ph,"Post-shock regions (PSR) of polar cataclysmic variables produce most of their luminosity and give rise to high circular polarization in optical wavelengths and strong variability on the white dwarf rotation period, which are distinctive features of these systems. To investigate the polar candidate V348 Pav, we obtained a comprehensive observational set including photometric, polarimetric, and spectroscopic data, which was used to constrain the post-shock properties of the system. The object presents high circular polarization (equation per cent) and high He II 4686A to Hequation line ratio, confirming it is a polar. From both radial velocities and light curves, we determined an orbital period of 79.98~min, close to the orbital period minimum of CVs. The Hequation radial velocity curve has a semi-amplitude of equation km sequation. Doppler tomography showed that most of the spectral line emission in this system is originated in the region of the companion star facing the WD, possibly irradiated by the emission related to the PSR. We modelled the PSR using the Cyclops code. The PSR density and temperature profiles, obtained by a proper solution of the hydro-thermodynamic equations, were used in a 3D radiative transfer solution that takes into account the system geometry. We could reproduce the V348 Pav \textitB, V, R, and \textitI photometric and polarimetric data using a model with a WD magnetic field of equation MG, a WD mass of equation~Mequation and a low (equation) orbital inclination. These values for the WD mass and orbital inclination are consistent with the measured radial velocities.",2019,[],5

The images show a characteristic separation due to the deflection of the first e- e pair in the Geomagnetic Field. We evaluate the performance of the standard stereoscopic analysis for such events.

1912.02833,astro-ph,"The asteroid belt is characterized by an extreme low total mass of material on dynamically excited orbits. The Nice Model explains many peculiar qualities of the solar system, including the belt's excited state, by invoking an orbital instability between the outer planets. However, previous studies of the Nice Model's effect on the belt's structure struggle to reproduce the innermost asteroids' orbital inclination distribution. Here, we show how the final phase of giant planet migration sculpts the asteroid belt, in particular its inclination distribution. As interactions with leftover planetesimals cause Saturn to move away from Jupiter, its rate of orbital precession slows as the two planets' mutual interactions weaken. When the planets approach their modern separation, where Jupiter completes just short of five orbits for every two of Saturn's, Jupiter's eccentric forcing on Saturn strengthens. We use numerical simulations to show that the absence of asteroids with orbits that precess between 24-28 arcsec/yr is related to the inclination problem. As Saturn's precession speeds back up, high inclination asteroids are excited on to planet crossing orbits and removed from the inner main belt. Through this process, the asteroid belt's orbital structure is reshaped, leading to markedly improved simulation outcomes.",2019,[],5
1909.12210,astro-ph,"The possible presence of graphene in the interstellar medium (ISM) is examined by comparing the interstellar extinction curve with the ultraviolet absorption of graphene calculated from its dielectric functions experimentally obtained with the electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) method. Based on the absence in the interstellar extinction curve of the ~2755 Angstrom equation--equation electronic interband transition of graphene, we place an upper limit of ~20ppm of C/H on the interstellar graphene abundance, exceeding the previous estimate by a factor of ~3 which made use of the dielectric functions measured with the spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) method. Compared with the SE method which measures graphene in air (and hence its surface is contaminated) in a limited energy range of ~0.7--5 eV, the EELS probes a much wider energy range of ~0--50 eV and is free of contamination. The fact that the EELS dielectric functions are substantially smaller than that of SE naturally explains why a higher upper limit on the graphene abundance is derived with EELS. Inspired by the possible detection of Cequation, a planar graphene sheet, in several Galactic and extragalactic planetary nebulae, we also examine the possible presence of Cequation in the diffuse ISM by comparing the model IR emission of Cequation with the observed IR emission of the Galactic cirrus and the diffuse ISM toward equation and equation. An upper limit of ~20 ppm on Cequation is also derived from the absence of the characteristic vibrational bands of Cequation at ~6.6, 9.8 and 20 equationm in the observed IR emission.",2019,[],5
1910.04045,astro-ph,"We present shape measurements of Milky Way-sized dark matter halos at redshift equation in a suite of 30 zoom simulations from the Auriga project. We compare the results in full magnetohydrodynamics against dark matter only simulations and find a strong influence of baryons in making dark matter haloes rounder at all radii compared to their dark matter only counterparts. At distances equation kpc, rounder dark matter distributions correlate with extended massive stellar discs and low core gas densities. We measure the alignment between the halo and the disc shapes at different radii and find a high degree of alignment at all radii for most of the galaxies. In some cases the alignment significantly changes as a function of radius implying that the halo shape twists; this effect correlates with recently formed bulges and is almost absent in the dark matter only simulations. In a comparison against observational constraints we find that equation of halos in our sample are consistent with observational results derived from the Pal 5 stream that favours an almost spherical shape. Including baryons is a required element to achieve this level of agreement. In contrast, none of the simulations (neither dark matter only nor with baryons) match the constraints derived from the Sagittarius stream that favour an oblate dark matter halo.",2019,[],5

Both methods generally work well even in the presence of systematic errors, although \tt JAVELIN generally provides better error estimates. Poorly estimated lightcurve uncertainties have less effect on the ICCF method because, unlike \tt JAVELIN, it does not explicitly assume Gaussian statistics. Neither method is sensitive to changes in the stochastic process driving the continuum or the transfer function relating the line lightcurve to the continuum. The only systematic error we considered that causes significant problems is if the line lightcurve is not a smoothed and shifted version of the continuum lightcurve but instead contains some additional sources of variability.",2019,[],5
1904.11644,astro-ph,"The galactic black hole candidate Cygnus X-1, one of the brightest sources in the sky, is the first ever black hole candidate to be discovered. Despite being a very well-studied object due to its persistent brightness in X-rays, there has been much difficulty in determining its mass since its discovery. In spite of continuous efforts since the early nineteen seventies, there is yet no concensus on its mass for nearly four decades. The uncertainties in the mass measurements are due to the high degree of error involved in the measurement of its distance. In 2011, Orosz et al. constrained the mass of this object to be M = 14.8 /- 1.0 MSun using dynamical methods. In this paper, we obtained the mass of Cygnus X-1, using a completely independent method, namely, carrying out the spectral analysis using Two Component Advective Flow (TCAF) solution based fits file and the archival data of RXTE PCA instrument. Our result does not require the distance of the source or the information about the companion. Each spectral fit with the TCAF gives one best fitted mass. Averaging fitted masses of Cygnus X-1 over a span of five months of observation during its persistent hard phase, mass of the source comes out to be Mavg = 14.20 /- 0.36 MSun, which is consistent with the dynamically estimated mass.",2019,[],5

The ARIANNA stations, including purpose built cosmic-ray stations at the Moore's Bay site and demonstrator stations at the South Pole, have operated reliably. Sustained operation at two distinct sites confirms that the flexible and adaptable architecture can be deployed in any deep ice, radio quiet environment.

The increased accretion is often accompanied by collimated jets and energetic, large-scale molecular outflows. The extra heating during the outburst may also induce detectable geometrical, chemical, and mineralogical changes in the circumstellar material, affecting possible planet formation around these objects. V346 Nor is a southern FUor with peculiar spectral characteristics. Decades after the beginning of its outburst, it unexpectedly underwent a fading event around 2010 due to a decrease in the mass accretion rate onto the star by at least two orders of magnitude.

Our light curves show a gradual re-brightening of V346 Nor, with its Ks-band brightness only 1.5 mag below the outburst brightness level. Our VLT/XSHOOTER spectroscopic observations display several strong forbidden emission lines towards the source from various metals and molecular hydrogen, suggesting the launch of a new jet.

When the resolution are reduced by 2, 4 and 8, the corresponding averages are 72/75/55, 66/68/49 and 57/59/41 G for equation/equation/equation, respectively. It is found that the forces indicated by equation and equation increase as thresholds/resolutions increase/decrease. While for equation the trends become more complex. For low threshold, when the resolution decrease the trends of equation are similar as those of equation and equation, while for high threshold the trends of equation are different from those of equation and equation. For original resolution, the forces indicated by equation increase as thresholds increase, while for others resolution they decrease as the thresholds increase contrarily.",2019,[],5
1903.00540,astro-ph,"Mixed damping is a physical effect that occurs when a heavy species is coupled to a relativistic fluid which is itself free streaming. As a cross-case between collisional damping and free-streaming, it is crucial in the context of neutrino-dark matter interactions. In this work, we establish the parameter space relevant for mixed damping, and we derive an analytical approximation for the evolution of dark matter perturbations in the mixed damping regime to illustrate the physical processes responsible for the suppression of cosmological perturbations. Although extended Boltzmann codes implementing neutrino-dark matter scattering terms automatically include mixed damping, this effect has not been systematically studied. In order to obtain reliable numerical results, it is mandatory to reconsider several aspects of neutrino-dark matter interactions, such as the initial conditions, the ultra-relativistic fluid approximation and high order multiple moments in the neutrino distribution. Such a precise treatment ensures the correct assessment of the relevance of mixed damping in neutrino-dark matter interactions.",2019,[],5
1903.05437,astro-ph,"A classic application of coronal seismology uses transverse oscillations of waveguides to obtain estimates of the magnetic field strength. The procedure requires information on the density of the structures. Often, it ignores the damping of the oscillations. We computed marginal posteriors for parameters such as the waveguide density; the density contrast; the transverse inhomogeneity length-scale; and the magnetic field strength, under the assumption that the oscillations can be modelled as standing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) kink modes damped by resonant absorption. Our results show that the magnetic field strength can be properly inferred, even if the densities inside and outside the structure are largely unknown. Incorporating observational estimates of plasma density further constrains the obtained posteriors. The amount of information one is willing to include (a priori) for the density and the density contrast influences their corresponding posteriors, but very little the inferred magnetic field strength. The decision to include or leave out the information on the damping and the damping time-scales have a minimal impact on the obtained magnetic field strength. In contrast to the classic method which provides with numerical estimates with error bars or possible ranges of variation for the magnetic field strength, Bayesian methods offer the full distribution of plausibility over the considered range of possible values. The methods are applied to available datasets of observed transverse loop oscillations, can be extended to prominence fine structures or chromospheric spicules and implemented to propagating waves in addition to standing oscillations.",2019,[],5

The maps reveal filamentary large-scale structures and two remarkable overdensities made out of at least 44 and 12 galaxies at equation (z57OD) and equation (z66OD), respectively, making z66OD the most distant overdensity spectroscopically confirmed to date with equation spectroscopically confirmed galaxies. We compare spatial distributions of submillimeter galaxies at equation with our equation galaxies forming the large-scale structures, and detect a equation signal of cross correlation, indicative of a clear coincidence of dusty star-forming galaxy and dust unobscured galaxy formation at this early epoch. The galaxies in z57OD and z66OD are actively forming stars with star formation rates (SFRs) equation times higher than the main sequence, and particularly the SFR density in z57OD is 10 times higher than the cosmic average at the redshift (a.k.a. the Madau-Lilly plot).

1909.07984,astro-ph,"We report the discovery of an intermediate-mass transiting brown dwarf, TOI-503b, from the TESS mission. TOI-503b is the first brown dwarf discovered by TESS and orbits a metallic-line A-type star with a period of equation days. The light curve from TESS indicates that TOI-503b transits its host star in a grazing manner, which limits the precision with which we measure the brown dwarf's radius (equation). We obtained high-resolution spectroscopic observations with the FIES, Ond\vrejov, PARAS, Tautenburg, and TRES spectrographs and measured the mass of TOI-503b to be equation. The host star has a mass of equation, a radius of equation, an effective temperature of equationK, and a relatively high metallicity of equation dex. We used stellar isochrones to derive the age of the system to be equation180 Myr, which places its age between that of RIK 72b (a equation10 Myr old brown dwarf in the Upper Scorpius stellar association) and AD 3116b (a equation600 Myr old brown dwarf in the Praesepe cluster). We argue that this brown dwarf formed in-situ, based on the young age of the system and the long circularization timescale for this brown dwarf around its host star. TOI-503b joins a growing number of known short-period, intermediate-mass brown dwarfs orbiting main sequence stars, and is the second such brown dwarf known to transit an A star, after HATS-70b. With the growth in the population in this regime, the driest region in the brown dwarf desert (equation) is reforesting and its mass range shrinking.",2019,[],5
1905.03274,astro-ph,"Next-generation radio surveys will yield an unprecedented amount of data, warranting analysis by use of machine learning techniques. Convolutional neural networks are the deep learning technique that has proven to be the most successful in classifying image data. Capsule networks are a more recently developed technique that use capsules comprised of groups of neurons, that describe properties of an image including the relative spatial locations of features. The current work explores the performance of different capsule network architectures against simpler convolutional neural network architectures, in reproducing the classifications into the classes of unresolved, FRI and FRII morphologies. We utilise images from a LOFAR survey which is the deepest, wide-area radio survey to date, revealing more complex radio-source structures compared to previous surveys, presenting further challenges for machine learning algorithms. The 4- and 8-layer convolutional networks attain an average precision of 93.3% and 94.3% respectively, compared to 89.7% obtained with the capsule network, when training on original and augmented images. Implementing transfer learning achieves a precision of 94.4%, that is within the confidence interval of the 8-layer convolutional network. The convolutional networks always outperform any variation of the capsule network, as they prove to be more robust to the presence of noise in images. The use of pooling appears to allow more freedom for the intra-class variability of radio galaxy morphologies, as well as reducing the impact of noise.",2019,[],5
1903.06599,astro-ph,"Wavefront sensors encode phase information of an incoming wavefront into an intensity pattern that can be measured on a camera. Several kinds of wavefront sensors (WFS) are used in astronomical adaptive optics. Amongst them, Fourier-based wavefront sensors perform a filtering operation on the wavefront in the focal plane. The most well known example of a WFS of this kind is the Zernike wavefront sensor, and the pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS) also belongs to this class. Based on this same principle, new WFSs can be proposed such as the n-faced pyramid (which ultimately becomes an axicone) or the flattened pyramid, depending on whether the image formation is incoherent or coherent. In order to test such novel concepts, the LOOPS adaptive optics testbed hosted at the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille has been upgraded by adding a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM). This device, placed in a focal plane produces high-definition phase masks that mimic otherwise bulk optic devices. In this paper, we first present the optical design and upgrades made to the experimental setup of the LOOPS bench. Then, we focus on the generation of the phase masks with the SLM and the implications of having such a device in a focal plane. Finally, we present the first closed-loop results in either static or dynamic mode with different WFS applied on the SLM.",2019,[],5
1908.10875,astro-ph,"The reverse shock in the ejecta of core-collapse supernovae is potentially able to destroy newly formed dust material. In order to determine dust survival rates, we have performed a set of hydrodynamic simulations using the grid-based code AstroBEAR in order to model a shock wave interacting with clumpy supernova ejecta. Dust motions and destruction rates were computed using our newly developed external, post-processing code Paperboats, which includes gas drag, grain charging, sputtering and grain-grain collisions. We have determined dust destruction rates for the oxygen-rich supernova remnant Cassiopeia A as a function of initial grain sizes and clump gas density. We found that up to 30 % of the carbon dust mass is able to survive the passage of the reverse shock if the initial grain size distribution is narrow with radii around ~10 - 50 nm for high gas densities, or with radii around ~0.5 - 1.5 equationm for low and medium gas densities. Silicate grains with initial radii around 10 - 30 nm show survival rates of up to 40 % for medium and high density contrasts, while silicate material with micron sized distributions is mostly destroyed. For both materials, the surviving dust mass is rearranged into a new size distribution that can be approximated by two components: a power-law distribution of small grains and a log-normal distribution of grains having the same size range as the initial distribution. Our results show that grain-grain collisions and sputtering are synergistic and that grain-grain collisions can play a crucial role in determining the surviving dust budget in supernova remnants.",2019,[],5
1902.08206,astro-ph,"A recent study using equation equation equation observations found periodic, high-speed, collimated ejections (or ""bullets"") from the star V Hya. The authors of that study proposed a model associating these bullets with the periastron passage of an unseen, substellar companion in an eccentric orbit and with an orbital period of equation yrs. Here we propose that V Hya is part of a triple system, with a substellar companion having an orbital period of equation yrs, and a tertiary object on a much wider orbit. In this model, the more distant object causes high-eccentricity excitations on the substellar companion's orbit via the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov mechanism. These eccentricities can reach such high values that they lead to Roche-lobe crossing, producing the observed bullet ejections via a strongly enhanced accretion episode. For example, we find that a ballistic bullet ejection mechanism can be produced by a brown-dwarf-mass companion, while magnetically driven outflows are consistent with a Jovian-mass companion. Finally, we suggest that the distant companion may reside at few a hundred AU on an eccentric orbit.",2019,[],5
1905.07972,astro-ph,"Numerical integration of orbit trajectories for a large number of initial conditions and for long time spans is computationally expensive. Semi-analytical methods were developed to reduce the computational burden. An elegant and widely used method of semi-analytically integrating trajectories of objects subject to atmospheric drag was proposed by King-Hele (KH). However, the analytical KH contraction method relies on the assumption that the atmosphere density decays strictly exponentially with altitude. If the actual density profile does not satisfy the assumption of a fixed scale height, as is the case for Earth's atmosphere, the KH method introduces potentially large errors for non-circular orbit configurations.   In this work, the KH method is extended to account for such errors by using a newly introduced atmosphere model derivative. By superimposing exponentially decaying partial atmospheres, the superimposed KH method can be applied accurately while considering more complex density profiles. The KH method is further refined by deriving higher order terms during the series expansion. A variable boundary condition to choose the appropriate eccentricity regime, based on the series truncation errors, is introduced. The accuracy of the extended analytical contraction method is shown to be comparable to numerical Gauss-Legendre quadrature. Propagation using the proposed method compares well against non-averaged integration of the dynamics, while the computational load remains very low.",2019,[],5
1912.06725,astro-ph,"We present an analysis of X-ray spectra of the high mass X-ray binary 4U 0115634 as observed with Suzaku and RXTE in 2011 July, during the fading phase of a giant X-ray outburst. We used a continuum model consisting of an absorbed cutoff power-law and an ad-hoc Gaussian emission feature centered around 8.5 keV, which we discuss to be due to cyclotron emission. Our results are consistent with a fundamental cyclotron absorption line centered at equation keV for all observed flux ranges. At the same time we rule out significant influence of the 8.5 kev Gaussian on the CRSF parameters, which are not consistent with the cyclotron line energies and depths of previously reported flux-dependent descriptions. We also show that some continuum models can lead to artificial line-like residuals in the analyzed spectra, which are then misinterpreted as unphysically strong cyclotron lines. Specifically, our results do not support the existence of a previously claimed additional cyclotron feature at equation keV. Apart from these features, we find for the first time evidence for a He-like Fe XXV emission line at equation keV and weak H-like Fe XXVI emission close to equation keV.",2019,[],5
1908.01358,astro-ph,"We report a multi-wavelength study of the massive (equation), equation star-forming galaxy GMASS 0953, which hosts an obscured AGN. We combined near-infrared observations of the GNIRS, SINFONI and KMOS spectrographs to study the kinematics of the [O III]equation and Hequation emission lines. Our analysis shows that GMASS 0953 may host an ionized disc extending up to 13 kpc, which rotates at a velocity of equation at the outermost radius. Evidence of rotation on a smaller scale (equation kpc) arises from the CO(J=6-5) line. The central velocity equation traced by the molecular gas is higher than equation, suggesting that the galaxy harbors a multi-phase disc with a rotation curve that peaks in the very central regions. The galaxy appears well located on the equation baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. We also discuss the possibility that the [O III]equation and Hequation velocity gradients are due to a galactic-scale wind. Besides, we found evidence of an AGN-driven outflow traced by a broad blueshifted wing affecting the [O III]equation line, which presents a velocity offset equation from the systemic velocity. Because of the short depletion timescale (equation yr) due to gas ejection and gas consumption by star formation activity, GMASS 0953 may likely evolve into a passive galaxy. However, the role of the AGN in depleting the gas reservoir of the galaxy is quite unclear because of the uncertainties affecting the outflow rate.",2019,[],5

Scattering information encoded in blue optical and near-UV (NUV) observations can help determine whether muted spectral features observed in the infrared are due to a hazy/cloudy atmosphere, or a clear atmosphere with a higher mean molecular weight. Farther into the UV, observations can identify atmospheric escape and mass loss from exoplanet atmospheres, providing a greater understanding of the atmospheric evolution of exoplanets, along with composition information from above the cloud deck.

Furthermore, we apply this method to four reported planetary events, MOA-2008-BLG-310, MOA-2011-BLG-293, OGLE-2012-BLG-0527, and OGLE-2012-BLG-0950, where adaptive optics observations have detected excess flux at the source star positions. For events with small angular Einstein radii, our lens mass estimates are more uncertain than those of previous analyses who assumed that the excess was due to the lens. Our predictions for MOA-2008-BLG-310 and OGLE-2012-BLG-0950 are consistent with recent results on these events obtained via Keck and Hubble Space Telescope observations when the source star is resolvable from the lens star. For events with small angular Einstein radii, we find that it is generally difficult to conclude whether the excess flux comes from the host star. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the lens star by measuring its proper motion relative to the source star to determine whether the excess flux comes from the lens star. Even without such measurements, our method can be used to statistically test the dependence of the planet-hosting probability on the stellar mass.",2019,[],5

Its sensitivity for energies equation\,keV was higher than that of any other solar X-ray spectrometer in orbit at the time, including the detectors on GOES. Using much improved instrumental data than was used previously, we analyzed SphinX spectra in 576 intervals for which there was no discernible activity (NA), 40 intervals when there were X-ray brightenings (B), and sixteen intervals when there were micro-flares with peak emission less than GOES A1 (F). An instrumental background spectrum, formed over 34 hours of spacecraft night-time periods and including electronic noise and particle radiation, was subtracted from the solar spectra. Theoretical spectra were used to deduce temperatures on an isothermal assumption for the NA, B, and F intervals (1.69, 1.81, and 1.86\,MK respectively). Differential emission measure (DEM) analysis for the same spectra revealed a ""cooler"" component (log\,equation or equation\,MK) in each case, but with a second hotter component having a less well-defined peak temperature varying from equation to equation\,MK (log\,equation and 6.55) and an emission measure between two and three orders smaller than that of the cooler component.

1902.03244,astro-ph,"We investigate the multi-wavelength properties of host galaxies of 3701 X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) out to z~5 in the Chandra-COSMOS Legacy Survey. Thanks to the extensive multi-wavelength photometry available in the COSMOS field, we derive AGN luminosities, host stellar masses, and star formation rates (SFRs) via a multi-component SED fitting technique. Type 1 and Type 2 AGNs follow the same intrinsic Lx-L6um relation, suggesting that mid-infrared emission is a reasonably good measure of the AGN accretion power regardless of obscuration. We find that there is a strong increase in Type 1 AGN fraction toward higher AGN luminosity, possibly due to the fact that Type 1 AGNs tend to be hosted by more massive galaxies. The AGN luminosity and SFR are consistent with an increase toward high stellar mass, while both the Mstellar-dependence is weaker towards the high-mass end, which could be interpreted as a consequence of quenching both star formation and AGN activity in massive galaxies. AGN host galaxies tend to have SFRs that are consistent with normal star-forming galaxies, independent of AGN luminosities. We confirm that black hole accretion rate and SFR are correlated up to z~5, when forming stars. The majority (~73%) of our AGN sample are faint in the far-infrared, implying that the moderate-luminosity AGNs seem to be still active after the star formation is suppressed. It is not certain whether AGN activity plays a role in quenching the star formation.

The observations demonstrate that three two-sided loop jets, which ejected along the large filament in opposite directions, had similar appearance and originated from the same region. We find that a minifilament erupted and drove the first jet. It reformed at the same neutral line later, and then underwent partial and total eruptions, drove the second and third jets, respectively. In the course of the jets, cool plasma was injected into the large filament. Furthermore, persistent magnetic flux cancelation occurred at the neutral line under the minifilament before its eruption and continued until the end of the observation. We infer that magnetic flux cancellation may account for building and then triggering the minifilament to erupt to produce the two-sided loop jets. This observation not only indicates that two-sided loop jets can be driven by minifilament eruptions, but also sheds new light on our understanding of the recurrent mechanism of two-sided loop jets.",2019,[],5
1904.09986,astro-ph,"Recent transmission spectroscopy has revealed that clouds and hazes are common in the atmospheres of close-in exoplanets. In this study, using the photochemical, microphysical, and transmission spectrum models for close-in warm (equation 1000 K) exoplanet atmospheres that we newly developed in our preceding paper (Kawashima & Ikoma 2018), we investigate the vertical distributions of haze particles and gaseous species and the resultant transmission spectra over wide ranges of the model parameters including UV irradiation intensity, metallicity, carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O), eddy diffusion coefficient, and temperature. The sensitivity to metallicity is of particular interest. We find that a rise in metallicity leads basically to reducing the photodissociation rates of the hydrocarbons and therefore the haze monomer production rates. This is due to an enhanced photon-shielding effect by the major photon absorbers such as equation, equation, equation, and equation, existing at higher altitudes than the hydrocarbons. We also find that at relatively short wavelengths (equation 2-3 equationm), the absorption features in transmission spectra are most pronounced for moderate metallicities such as 100 times the solar metallicity, whereas the lower the metallicity the stronger the absorption features at relatively long wavelengths (equation 2-3 equationm), where the contribution of haze is small. These are because of the two competing effects of reduced haze production rate and atmospheric scale height for higher metallicities. For the other model parameters, we show that stronger absorption features appear in transmission spectra of the atmospheres with lower UV irradiation, lower C/O ratio, higher eddy diffusion coefficient, and higher temperature.",2019,[],5

We find the black hole masses equation range from equation to equation equation, and the Eddington ratios equation vary from equation to equation, suggesting that young radio AGNs have various accretion activities and not all are accreting at high accretion rate. Our young radio sources generally follow the evolutionary trend towards large-scale radio galaxies with increasing linear size and decreasing accretion rate in the radio power - linear size diagram. The radio properties of low luminosity young radio AGNs with low equation are discussed. The line width of [O III] equation core (equation) is found to be a good surrogate of stellar velocity dispersion equation. The radio luminosity equation correlates strongly with [O III] core luminosity equation, suggesting that radio activity and accretion are closely related in young radio sources. We find one object that can be defined as narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s), representing a population of young AGNs both with young jet and early accretion activity.

High dispersion long-slit echelle spectra along with high resolution images from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) are applied in the astronomical code SHAPE in order to reproduce a three-dimensional morpho-kinematical model for the core and the bipolar outflows. Its central part shows a number of low-ionization filamentary structures (knots and jets) indicative of common-envelope PNe evolution and it is reconstructed assuming a toroidal structure. The high-resolution HST [N II] image of Hb4 unveils the fragmented structure of outflows. The northern and southern outflows are composed by four and three knots, respectively, and each knot moves outwards with its own expansion velocity. They are reconstructed as string of knots rather than jets.This string of knots is formed by ejection events repeated every 200- 250 years.

Following the orbital motion of the planet, the tidal fluid flow in the star can be detected with the radial velocity method. Its signature manifests as the second harmonics of the orbital frequency that mimics a non-zero orbital eccentricity. Using the new radial velocity measurements acquired with the HARPS-N spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and combining them with the literature data, we show that the apparent eccentricity of WASP-12 b's orbit is non-zero at a 5.8 sigma level, and the longitude of periastron of this apparently eccentric orbit is close to 270 degrees. This orbital configuration is compatible with a model composed of a circular orbit and a signature of tides raised in the host star. The radial velocity amplitude of those tides was found to be consistent with the equilibrium tide approximation.

(2000), as well as 1124 stars observed in the four-year Kepler mission. For each star we considered the dominant pulsation period, and used DR2 parallaxes and extinction corrections to determine absolute V magnitudes. Many stars fall along a sequence in the P-L relation coinciding with fundamental-mode pulsation, while others pulsate in shorter-period overtones. The latter stars tend to have higher effective temperatures, consistent with theoretical calculations. Surprisingly, we find an excess of stars lying on a ridge with periods half that of the fundamental. We suggest this may be due to a 2:1 resonance between the third or fourth overtone and the fundamental mode.",2019,[],5
1905.00426,astro-ph,"The cosmic infrared background (CIB) is a powerful probe of large-scale structure across a very large redshift range, and consists of unresolved redshifted infrared emission from dusty galaxies. It can be used to study the astrophysics of galaxies, the star formation history of the universe, and the connection between dark and luminous matter. It can furthermore be used as a tracer of the large-scale structure and thus assist in de-lensing of the cosmic microwave background. The major difficulty in its use lies in obtaining accurate and unbiased large-scale CIB images that are cleaned of the contamination by Galactic dust. We used data on neutral atomic hydrogen from the recently-released HI4PI Survey to create template maps of Galactic dust, allowing us to remove this component from the Planck intensity maps from 353 to 857 GHz for approximately equation of the sky. This allows us to constrain the CIB power spectrum down to equation. We present these CIB maps and the various processing and validation steps that we have performed to ensure their quality, as well as a comparison with previous studies. All our data products are made publicly available at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/8A1SR3, thereby enabling the community to investigate a wide range of questions related to the universe's large-scale structure.",2019,[],5
1903.05624,astro-ph,"The circumstellar habitable zone and its various refinements serves as a useful entry point for discussing the potential for a planet to generate and sustain life. But little attention is paid to the quality of available energy in the form of stellar photons for phototrophic (e.g. photosynthetic) life. This short paper discusses the application of the concept of exergy to exoplanetary environments and the evaluation of the maximum efficiency of energy use, or maximum work obtainable from electromagnetic radiation. Hotter stars provide temperate planets with higher maximum obtainable work with higher efficiency than cool stars, and cool planets provide higher efficiency of radiation conversion from the same stellar photons than do hot planets. These statements are independent of the details of any photochemical and biochemical mechanisms and could produce systematic differences in planetary habitability, especially at the extremes of maximal or minimal biospheres, or at critical ecological tipping points. Photoautotrophic biospheres on habitable planets around M-dwarf stars may be doubly disadvantaged by lower fluxes of photosynthetically active photons, and lower exergy with lower energy conversion efficiency.",2019,[],5

We present properties derived from high-resolution optical spectra for 336 candidate young nearby, low-mass stars. These include measurements of radial velocities and age diagnostics such as Hequation and Li equation6707 equivalent widths. Combining our radial velocities with astrometry from Gaia DR2, we provide full 3D kinematics for the entire sample. We combine the measured spectroscopic youth information with additional age diagnostics (e.g., X-ray and UV fluxes, CMD positions) and kinematics to evaluate potential membership in nearby, young moving groups and associations. We identify 78 objects in our sample as bonafide members of 10 different moving groups, 15 of which are completely new members or have had their group membership reassigned. We also reject 44 previously proposed candidate moving group members. Furthermore, we have newly identified or confirmed the youth of numerous additional stars that do not belong to any currently known group, and find 69 co-moving systems using Gaia DR2 astrometry. We also find evidence that the Carina association is younger than previously thought, with an age similar to the equation Pictoris moving group (equation22 Myr).",2019,[],5

These observations were made using a newly commissioned receiver system on the 13.7-m radio telescope at the Taeduk Radio Astronomy Observatory. Our observations show that the molecular clouds have a spatial extent of equation pc and a total mass of equation Mequation. Infrared data from WISE and 2MASS were used to identify and classify the YSO population associated with ongoing star formation activity within the molecular clouds. We directly detect 18 class I/class II YSOs and six transition disk objects. Moving away from the HII region, there is an age/class gradient consistent with sequential star formation. The infrared and molecular-line data were combined to estimate the star formation efficiency (SFE) of the entire cloud as well as the SFE for various sub-regions of the cloud. We find that the overall SFE is between equation%, consistent with previous observations of giant molecular clouds. One of the sub-regions, region 1a, is a clear outlier, with a SFE of 17 equation 35% on a 5 pc spatial scale. This high SFE is more typical for much smaller (sub-pc scale) star-forming cores, and we think region 1a is likely an embedded massive protocluster.",2019,[],5

Analysis of the components suggests a semi-parabolic jet geometry with jet radius equation following the relation equation with distance equation, with indications of a jet geometry break towards a conical geometry. Brightness temperature falls with distance following equation. Combining this information, magnetic field and electron densities are found to fall along the jet as equation and equation respectively, suggesting that the magnetic configuration in the jet may be dominated by the poloidal component. Our analysis of the jet structure suggests that the innermost jet regions do not follow a ballistic trajectory and, instead, match a sinusoidal morphology which could be due to jet precession from a helical pattern or Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities.",2019,[],5
1904.07254,astro-ph,"We present results from a survey of galaxies in the fields of six z>3 Damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs) using the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). We report a high detection rate of up to ~80% of galaxies within 1000 km/s from DLAs and with impact parameters between 25 and 280 kpc. In particular, we discovered 5 high-confidence Lyman alpha emitters associated with three DLAs, plus up to 9 additional detections across five of the six fields. The majority of the detections are at relatively large impact parameters (>50 kpc) with two detections being plausible host galaxies. Among our detections, we report four galaxies associated with the most metal-poor DLA in our sample (Z/Zsun = -2.33), which trace an overdense structure resembling a filament. By comparing our detections with predictions from the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) cosmological simulations and a semi-analytic model designed to reproduce the observed bias of DLAs at z>2, we conclude that our observations are consistent with a scenario in which a significant fraction of DLAs trace the neutral regions within halos with a characteristic mass of 1011-1012 Msun, in agreement with the inference made from the large-scale clustering of DLAs. We finally show how larger surveys targeting ~25 absorbers have the potential of constraining the characteristic masses of halos hosting high-redshift DLAs with sufficient accuracy to discriminate between different models.",2019,[],5
1904.00094,astro-ph,"The advent of large-scale spectroscopic surveys underscores the need to develop robust techniques for determining stellar properties (""labels"", i.e., physical parameters and elemental abundances). However, traditional spectroscopic methods that utilize stellar models struggle to reproduce cool (equation4700 K) stellar atmospheres due to an abundance of unconstrained molecular transitions, making modeling via synthetic spectral libraries difficult. Because small, cool stars such as K and M dwarfs are both common and good targets for finding small, cool planets, establishing precise spectral modeling techniques for these stars is of high priority. To address this, we apply The Cannon, a data-driven method of determining stellar labels, to Keck High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) spectra of 141 cool (equation5200 K) stars from the California Planet Search. Our implementation is capable of predicting labels for small (equation1 equation) stars of spectral types K and later with accuracies of 68 K in effective temperature (equation), 5% in stellar radius (equation), and 0.08 dex in bulk metallicity ([Fe/H]), and maintains this performance at low spectral resolutions (equation equation 5000).

1906.12308,astro-ph,"We study the relation between the internal structures of 10 benchmark main-sequence F-stars and their rotational properties. Stellar rotation of main-sequence F-type stars can be characterised by two distinct rotational regimes. Early-type F-stars are usually rapid rotators with periods typically below 10 days, whereas later-type F-stars have longer rotation periods. Specifically, and since the two rotational regimes are tightly connected to the effective temperatures of the stars, we investigate in detail the characteristics of the partial ionisation zones in the outer convective envelopes of these stars, which in turn, depend on the internal temperature profiles. Our study shows that the two rotational regimes might be distinguished by the relative locations of the partial ionisation region of heavy elements and the base of the convective zone. Since in all these stars is expected a dynamo-driven magnetic field where the shear layer between convective and radiative zones (tachocline) plays an important role, this result suggests that the magnetic field may be related to the combined properties of convection and ionisation.",2019,[],5

New stellar parameters are determined based on the Gaia DR2 parallactic distances and Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database isochrones. These are in excellent agreement with spectroscopically determined stellar parameters for stars with [Fe/H]equation; however, large disagreements are found for stars with [Fe/H]equation, with offsets as large as equationTequation K and equationlog\,equation. A subset of six stars (test cases) are analysed ab initio using high resolution spectra with Keck HIRES and Gemini GRACES. This sub-sample is found to include two equation-challenged dwarf stars, suggestive of origins in a low mass, accreted dwarf galaxy. The orbital parameters for the entire SB02 sample are re-determined using \textitGaia DR2 data. We find 11 stars that are dynamically coincident with the \textitGaia-Sausage accretion event and another 17 with the \textitGaia-Sequoia event in action space. Both associations include low-mass, metal-poor stars with isochrone ages older than 10 Gyr. Two dynamical subsets are identified within \textitGaia-Sequoia. When these subsets are examined separately, a common knee in [equation/Fe] is found for the \textitGaia-Sausage and low orbital energy \textitGaia-Sequoia stars. A lower metallicity knee is tentatively identified in the \textitGaia-Sequoia high orbital energy stars.

1907.01017,astro-ph,"We present the results from the Suzaku X-ray Imaging Spectrometer observation of the mixed-morphology supernova remnant (SNR) HB9 (G160.92.6). We discovered recombining plasma (RP) in the western Suzaku observation region and the spectra here are well described by a model having collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) and RP components. On the other hand, the X-ray spectra from the eastern Suzaku observation region are best reproduced by the CIE and non-equilibrium ionization model. We discuss possible scenarios to explain the origin of the RP emission based on the observational properties and concluded that the rarefaction scenario is a possible explanation for the existence of RP. In addition, the gamma-ray emission morphology and spectrum within the energy range of 0.2equation300 GeV are investigated using equation10 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). The gamma-ray morphology of HB9 is best described by the spatial template of radio continuum emission.

1907.08471,astro-ph,"Solid particles in protoplanetary discs can grow by direct vapour deposition outside of ice lines. The presence of microscopic silicate particles may nevertheless hinder growth into large pebbles, since the available vapour is deposited predominantly on the small grains that dominate the total surface area. Experiments on heterogeneous ice nucleation, performed to understand ice clouds in the Martian atmosphere, show that the formation of a new ice layer on a silicate surface requires a substantially higher water vapour pressure than the deposition of water vapour on an existing ice surface. In this paper, we investigate how the difference in partial vapour pressure needed for deposition of vapour on water ice versus heterogeneous ice nucleation on silicate grains influences particle growth close to the water ice line. We developed and tested a dynamical 1D deposition and sublimation model, where we include radial drift, sedimentation, and diffusion in a turbulent protoplanetary disc. We find that vapour is deposited predominantly on already ice-covered particles, since the vapour pressure exterior of the ice line is too low for heterogeneous nucleation on bare silicate grains. Icy particles can thus grow to centimetre-sized pebbles in a narrow region around the ice line, whereas silicate particles stay dust-sized and diffuse out over the disc. The inhibition of heterogeneous ice nucleation results in a preferential region for growth into planetesimals close to the ice line where we find large icy pebbles. The suppression of heterogeneous ice nucleation on silicate grains may also be the mechanism behind some of the observed dark rings around ice lines in protoplanetary discs, as the presence of large ice pebbles outside ice lines leads to a decrease in the opacity there.",2019,[],5
1906.03877,astro-ph,"If the alpha effect plays a role in the generation of the Sun's magnetic field, the field should show evidence of magnetic helicity of opposite signs at large and small length scales. Measuring this faces two challenges: (i) in weak-field regions, horizontal field measurements are unreliable because of the pi ambiguity, and (ii) one needs a truly global approach to computing helicity spectra in the case where one expects a sign reversal across the equator at all wavenumbers. Here we develop such a method using spin-2 spherical harmonics to decompose the linear polarization in terms of the parity-even and parity-odd E and B polarizations, respectively. Using simple one- and two-dimensional models, we show that the product of the spectral decompositions of E and B, taken at spherical harmonic degrees that are shifted by one, can act as a proxy of the global magnetic helicity with a sign that represents that in the northern hemisphere. We then apply this method to the analysis of solar synoptic vector magnetograms, from which we extract a pseudo-polarization corresponding to a ""pi-ambiguated"" magnetic field, i.e., a magnetic field vector that has no arrow. We find a negative sign of the global EB helicity proxy at spherical harmonic degrees of around 6. This could indicate a positive magnetic helicity at large length scales, but the spectrum fails to capture clear evidence of the well-known negative magnetic helicity at smaller scales. This method might also be applicable to stellar and Galactic polarization data.",2019,[],5

Lucky imaging has been an operational technique to measure the positions of visual binary systems for a decade and a half, enough to apply its results to the calculation of orbits of some massive multiple systems within ~1 kpc of the Sun. AIMS: We are measuring distances to Galactic stellar groups containing O stars and I start with two of them: Collinder 419 in Cygnus and NGC 2264 in Monoceros. I also aim to derive new astrometric orbits for the Aa,Ab components for the main ionizing sources for both clusters: HD 193 322 and 15 Mon, respectively. METHODS: First, I present a method that uses Gaia DR2 photometry, positions, proper motions, and parallaxes to obtain the membership and distance of a stellar group and apply it to Collinder 419 and NGC 2264. Second, I present a new code that calculates astrometric orbits by searching the whole 7-parameter orbit space and apply it to HD 193 322 Aa,Ab and 15 Mon Aa,Ab using as input literature data from the Washington Double Star Catalog (WDS) and the AstraLux measurements recently presented by Ma\'iz Apell\'aniz et al.

RESULTS: I obtain Gaia DR2 distances of 100637-34 pc for Collinder 419 and 719-16 pc for NGC 2264, with the main contribution to the uncertainties coming from the spatial covariance of the parallaxes. The two NGC 2264 subclusters are at the same distance (within the uncertainties) and they show a significant relative proper motion. The distances are shown to be robust.

1903.01471,astro-ph,"We investigate a mechanism for accelerating cool (10equation K) clouds in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) with cosmic rays (CRs), possibly explaining some characteristics of observed high velocity clouds (HVCs). Enforcing CRs to stream down their pressure gradient into a region of slow streaming speed results in significant buildup of CR pressure which can accelerate the CGM. We present the results of the first two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of such `CR bottlenecks,' expanding on simpler simulations in 1D from \citewiener17a. Although much more investigation is required, we find two main results. First, radiative cooling in the interfaces of these clouds is sufficient to keep the cloud intact to CR wave heating. Second, cloud acceleration depends almost linearly with the injected CR flux at low values (comparable to that expected from a Milky Way-like star formation rate), but scales sublinearly at higher CR fluxes in 1D simulations. 2D simulations show hints of sublinear dependence at high CR fluxes but are consistent with pure linear dependence up to the CR fluxes tested. It is therefore plausible to accelerate cool clouds in the CGM to speeds of hundreds of km sequation.",2019,[],5
1911.08353,astro-ph,"The line-of-sight peculiar velocities of galaxies contribute to their observed redshifts, breaking the translational invariance of galaxy clustering down to a rotational invariance around the observer. This becomes important when the line-of-sight direction varies significantly across a survey, leading to what are known as `wide angle' effects in redshift space distortions. Wide-angle effects will also be present in measurements of the momentum field, i.e. the galaxy density-weighted velocity field, in upcoming peculiar velocity surveys. In this work we study how wide-angle effects modify the predicted correlation function and power spectrum for momentum statistics, both in auto-correlation and in cross-correlation with the density field. Using both linear theory and the Zeldovich approximation, we find that deviations from the plane-parallel limit are large and could become important in data analysis for low redshift surveys. We point out that even multipoles in the cross-correlation between density and momentum are non-zero regardless of the choice of line of sight, and therefore contain new cosmological information that could be exploited. We discuss configuration-space, Fourier-space and spherical analyses, providing exact expressions in each case rather than relying on an expansion in small angles. We hope these expressions will be of use in the analysis of upcoming surveys for redshift-space distortions and peculiar velocities.",2019,[],5

1906.01847,astro-ph,"The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) will investigate the origins of cosmic acceleration using weak gravitational lensing at near infrared wavelengths. Lensing analyses place strict constraints on the precision of size and ellipticity measurements of the point spread function. WFIRST will use infrared detector arrays, which must be fully characterized to inform data reduction and calibration procedures such that unbiased cosmological results can be achieved. Hirata & Choi 2019 introduces formalism to connect the cross-correlation signal of different flat field time samples to non-linear detector behaviors such as the brighter fatter effect (BFE) and non-linear inter-pixel capacitance (NL-IPC), and this paper applies that framework to a WFIRST development detector, SCA 18237. We find a residual correlation signal after accounting for classical non-linearity. This residual correlation contains a combination of the BFE and NL-IPC; however, further tests suggest that the BFE is the dominant mechanism. If interpreted as a pure BFE, it suggests that the effective area of a pixel is increased by equation (stat.) for every electron in the 4 nearest neighbors, with a rapid equation fall-off of the effect for more distant neighbors. We show that the IPC inferred from hot pixels contains the same large-scale spatial variations as the IPC inferred from auto-correlations, albeit with an overall offset of equation. The NL-IPC inferred from hot pixels is too small to explain the cross-correlation measurement, further supporting the BFE hypothesis. This work presents the first evidence for the BFE in an H4RG-10 detector, demonstrates some of the useful insights that can be gleaned from flat field statistics, and represents a significant step towards calibration of WFIRST data.",2019,[],5
1910.07527,astro-ph,"We determine the observability in transmission of inhomogeneous cloud cover on the limbs of hot Jupiters through post processing a general circulation model to include cloud distributions computed using a cloud microphysics model. We find that both the east and west limb often form clouds, but that the different properties of these clouds enhances the limb to limb differences compared to the clear case. Using JWST it should be possible to detect the presence of cloud inhomogeneities by comparing the shape of the transit lightcurve at multiple wavelengths because inhomogeneous clouds impart a characteristic, wavelength dependent signature. This method is statistically robust even with limited wavelength coverage, uncertainty on limb darkening coefficients, and imprecise transit times. We predict that the short wavelength slope varies strongly with temperature. The hot limb of the hottest planets form higher altitude clouds composed of smaller particles leading to a strong rayleigh slope. The near infrared spectral features of clouds are almost always detectable, even when no spectral slope is visible in the optical. In some of our models a spectral window between 5 and 9 microns can be used to probe through the clouds and detect chemical spectral features. Our cloud particle size distributions are not log-normal and differ from species to species. Using the area or mass weighted particle size significantly alters the relative strength of the cloud spectral features compared to using the predicted size distribution. Finally, the cloud content of a given planet is sensitive to a species' desorption energy and contact angle, two parameters that could be constrained experimentally in the future.",2019,[],5
1908.06221,astro-ph,"PSR J0108equation1431 is an old pulsar where the X-ray emission is expected to have a thermal component from the polar cap and a non-thermal component from the magnetosphere. Although the phase-integrated spectra are fit best with a single non-thermal component modeled with a power-law (PL) of photon index equation, the X-ray pulse profiles do show the presence of phase-separated thermal and non-thermal components. The spectrum extracted from half the rotational phase away from the X-ray peak fits well with either a single blackbody (BB) or a neutron star atmosphere (NA) model, whereas, the spectrum from the rest of the phase range is dominated by a PL. From Bayesian analysis, the estimated BB area is smaller than the expected polar cap area for a dipolar magnetic field with a probability of 86% whereas the area estimate from the NA model is larger with a probability of 80%. Due to the ambiguity in the thermal emission model, the polar cap area cannot be reliably estimated and hence cannot be used to understand the nature of the surface magnetic field. Instead, we can infer the presence of multipolar magnetic field from the misalignment between the pulsar's thermal X-ray peak and the radio emission peak. For J0108equation1431, we estimated a phase-offset equation between the thermal polar cap emission peak and the radio emission peak and argue that this is best explained by the presence of a multipolar surface magnetic field.",2019,[],5

The Herschel column density (N(H2)) map reveals a massive inverted Y-like structure (mass ~6280 Msun), which hosts a pair of elongated filaments (lengths >10 pc). The Herschel temperature map depicts the filaments in a temperature range of ~12.5-13.5 K. These elongated filaments overlap each other at several places, where N(H2) > 4.5 x 1021cm-2. The 12CO and 13CO line data also show two elongated cloud components (around -1.5 and -4.5 km/s) toward the inverted Y-like structure, which are connected in the velocity space. First moment maps of CO confirm the presence of two intertwined filamentary clouds along the line of sight. These results explain the morphology of the inverted Y-like structure through a combination of two different filamentary clouds, which are also supported by the distribution of the cold HI gas. Based on the distribution of young stellar objects (YSOs), star formation (SF) activities are investigated toward the inverted Y-like structure. The northern end of the structure hosts AFGL 5142 and tracers of massive SF, where high surface density of YSOs (i.e., 5-240 YSOs/pc2) reveals strong SF activity. Furthermore, noticeable YSOs are found toward the overlapping zones of the clouds.

1904.10288,astro-ph,"Identification of the main planet formation site is fundamental to understanding how planets form and migrate to the current locations. We consider the heavy-element content trend of observed exoplanets derived from improved measurements of mass and radius, and explore how this trend can be used as a tracer of their formation sites. Using gas accretion recipes obtained from detailed hydrodynamical simulations, we confirm that the disk-limited gas accretion regime is most important for reproducing the heavy-element content trend. Given that such a regime is specified by two characteristic masses of planets, we compute these masses as a function of the distance (equation) from the central star, and then examine how the regime appears in the mass-semimajor axis diagram. Our results show that a plausible solid accretion region emerges at equation au and expands with increasing equation, using the conventional disk model. Given that exoplanets that possess the heavy-element content trend distribute currently near their central stars, our results imply the importance of planetary migration that would occur after solid accretion onto planets might be nearly completed at equation au.

1907.09683,astro-ph,"An unknown absorber near the cloud top level of Venus generates a broad absorption feature from the ultraviolet (UV) to visible, peaking around 360 nm, and therefore plays a critical role in the solar energy absorption. We present a quantitative study on the variability of the cloud albedo at 365 nm and its impact on Venus' solar heating rates based on an analysis of Venus Express and Akatsuki's UV images, and Hubble Space Telescope and MESSENGER's UV spectral data; in this analysis the calibration correction factor of the UV images of Venus Express (VMC) is updated relative to the Hubble and MESSENGER albedo measurements. Our results indicate that the 365-nm albedo varied by a factor of 2 from 2006 to 2017 over the entire planet, producing a 25-40% change in the low latitude solar heating rate according to our radiative transfer calculations. Thus, the cloud top level atmosphere should have experienced considerable solar heating variations over this period. Our global circulation model calculations show that this variable solar heating rate may explain the observed variations of zonal wind from 2006 to 2017. Overlaps in the timescale of the long-term UV albedo and the solar activity variations make it plausible that solar extreme UV intensity and cosmic-ray variations influenced the observed albedo trends. The albedo variations might also be linked with temporal variations of the upper cloud SO2 gas abundance, which affects the H2SO4-H2O aerosol formation.",2019,[],5
1904.05912,astro-ph,"Metal poor dwarf galaxies in the local universe, such as those found in the RESOLVE galaxy survey, often produce high [O III]/H\beta ratios close to the star forming demarcation lines of the diagnostic BPT diagram. Modeling the emission from these galaxies at lower metallicities generally underpredicts this line ratio, which is typically attributed to a deficit of photons >35 eV. We show that applying a model that includes empirical abundances scaled with metallicity strongly influences the thermal balance in HII regions and preserves the [O III]/H\beta offset even in the presence of a harder radiation field generated by interacting binaries. Additional heating mechanisms are more successful in addressing the offset. In accordance with the high sSFR typical of dwarf galaxies in the sample, we demonstrate that cosmic ray heating serves as one mechanism capable of aligning spectral synthesis predictions with observations. We also show that incorporating a range of physical conditions in our modeling can create even better agreement between model calculations and observed emission line ratios. Together these results emphasize that both the hardness of the incident continuum and the variety of physical conditions present in nebular gas clouds must be accurately accounted for prior to drawing conclusions from emission line diagnostic diagrams.",2019,[],5
1901.08475,astro-ph,"We propose an alternative physical mechanism to explain the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe based on the configuration entropy of the cosmic web and its evolution. We show that the sheets, filaments and clusters in the cosmic web act as sinks whereas the voids act as the sources of information. The differential entropy of the cosmic velocity field increases with time and also acts as a source of entropy. The growth of non-linear structures and the emergence of the cosmic web may lead to a situation where the overall dissipation rate of information at the sinks are about to dominate the generation rate of information from the sources. Consequently, the Universe either requires a dispersal of the overdense non-linear structures or an accelerated expansion of the underdense voids to prevent a violation of the second law of thermodynamics. The dispersal of the sheets, filaments and clusters are not a viable option due to the attractive nature of gravity but the repulsive and outward peculiar gravitational acceleration at the voids makes it easier to stretch them at an accelerated rate. We argue that this accelerated expansion of the voids inside the cosmic web may mimic the behaviour of dark energy.",2019,[],5
1910.07832,astro-ph,"The advent of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has enabled a new era for studies of the formation and assembly of distant galaxies. Cosmological deep field surveys with ALMA and other interferometers have flourished in the last few years covering wide ranges of galaxy properties and redshift, and allowing us to gain critical insights into the physical mechanisms behind the galaxy growth. Here, we present a brief review of recent studies that aim to characterize the interstellar medium properties of galaxies at high redshift (equation), focusing on blank-field ALMA surveys of dust continuum and molecular line emission. In particular, we show recent results from the ALMA Spectroscopic Survey in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (ASPECS) large program.",2019,[],5
1912.07615,astro-ph,"This paper presents the first systematic study of proto-neutron star (PNS) convection in three dimensions (3D) based on our latest numerical Fornax models of core-collapse supernova (CCSN). We confirm that PNS convection commonly occurs, and then quantify the basic physical characteristics of the convection. By virtue of the large number of long-term models, the diversity of PNS convective behavior emerges. We find that the vigor of PNS convection is not correlated with CCSN dynamics at large radii, but rather with the mass of PNS equation heavier masses are associated with stronger PNS convection. We find that PNS convection boosts the luminosities of equation, equation, equation, and equation neutrinos, while the impact on other species is complex due to a competition of factors. Finally, we assess the consequent impact on CCSN dynamics and the potential for PNS convection to generate pulsar magnetic fields.",2019,[],5
1911.11478,astro-ph,"Compact group (CG) is a kind of special galaxy system where the galaxy members are separated at the distances of the order of galaxy size. The strong interaction between the galaxy members makes CGs ideal labs for studying the environmental effects on galaxy evolution. Traditional photometric selection algorithm biases against the CG candidates at low redshifts, while spectroscopic identification technique is affected by the spectroscopic incompleteness of sample galaxies and typically biases against the high redshift candidates. In this study, we combine these two methods and select CGs in the main galaxy sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, where we also have taken the advantages of the complementary redshift measurements from the LAMOST spectral and GAMA surveys. We have obtained the largest and most complete CG samples to date. Our samples include 6,144 CGs and 8,022 CG candidates, which are unique in the studies of the nature of the CGs and the evolution of the galaxies inside.",2019,[],5
1912.00371,astro-ph,"Shock-induced metamorphism in meteorites informs us about the collisional environment and history of our solar system. Recently the importance of material strength in impact heating was reported from head-on impact simulations. Here, we perform three-dimensional oblique impact simulations, and confirm the additional heating due to material strength for oblique impacts. Despite a large difference in the peak pressure at the impact point at a given impact velocity, we find that the heated mass for an oblique impact is nearly the same as that for a head-on impact. Thus, our results differ from the previous finding that the heated mass decreases as the impact becomes more oblique, and show that the additional shear heating is more effective for oblique impacts than for head-on impacts. This also indicates that material ejected during oblique impact tends to experience lower shock pressures but higher temperatures.",2019,[],5
1903.09163,astro-ph,"[KKS2000]04 (NGC1052-DF2) has become a controversial and well-studied galaxy after the claims suggesting a lack of dark matter and the presence of an anomalously bright globular cluster (GC) system around it. A precise determination of its overall star formation history (SFH) as well as a better characterisation of its GC or planetary nebulae (PN) systems are crucial aspects to: i) understand its real nature, in particular placing it within the family of ultra diffuse galaxies; ii) shed light on its possible formation, evolution, and survival in the absence of dark matter. With this purpose we expand on the knowledge of [KKS2000]04 from the analysis of OSIRIS@GTC spectroscopic data. On the one hand, we claim the possible detection of two new PNe and confirm membership of 5 GCs. On the other hand, we find that the stars shaping [KKS2000]04 are intermediate-age to old (90\% of its stellar mass older than 5 Gyr, average age of 8.7 equation 0.7 Gyr) and metal-poor ([M/H] equation -1.18 equation 0.05), in general agreement with previous results. We do not find any clear hints of significant changes in its stellar content with radius. In addition, the possibility of [KKS2000]04 being a tidal dwarf galaxy with no dark matter is highly disfavoured.",2019,[],5
1909.12889,astro-ph,"Neutron star mergers (NSMs) are rapid neutron capture (equation-process) nucleosynthesis sites that expel matter at high velocities, from equation to as high as equation. Nuclei ejected at these speeds are sufficiently energetic to initiate spallation nuclear reactions with interstellar medium particles. We adopt a thick-target model for the propagation of high-speed heavy nuclei in the interstellar medium, similar to the transport of cosmic rays. We find that spallation may create observable perturbations to NSM isotopic abundances, particularly around the low-mass edges of the equation-process peaks where neighboring nuclei have very different abundances. The extent to which spallation modifies the final NSM isotopic yields depends on: (1) the ejected abundances, which are determined by the NSM astrophysical conditions and the properties of nuclei far from stability, (2) the ejecta velocity distribution and propagation in interstellar matter, and (3) the spallation cross-sections. Observed solar and stellar equation-process yields could thus constrain the velocity distribution of ejected neutron star matter, assuming NSMs are the dominant equation-process source. We suggest avenues for future work, including measurement of relevant cross sections.",2019,[],5
1911.01838,astro-ph,"The recent imaging of the M87 black hole at millimeter wavelengths by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration has triggered a renewed interest in numerical models for the accretion of magnetized plasma in the regime of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD). Here non-ideal simulations, including both the resistive effects and, above all, the mean-field dynamo action due to sub-scale, unresolved turbulence, are applied for the first time to such systems in the fully nonlinear regime. Combined with the differential rotation of the disk, the dynamo process is able to produce an exponential growth of any initial seed magnetic field up to the values required to explain the observations, when the instability tends to saturate even in the absence of artificial quenching effects. Before reaching the final saturation stage we observe a secondary regime of exponential growing, where the magnetic field increases more slowly due to accretion, which is modifying the underlying equilibrium. By varying the dynamo coefficient we obtain different growth rates, though the field seems to saturate at approximately the same level, at least for the limited range of parameters explored here, providing substantial values for the MAD parameter for magnetized accretion. For reasonable values of the central mass density and the commonly employed recipes for synchrotron emission by relativistically hot electrons, our model is able to reproduce naturally the observed flux of Sgr A*, the next target for EHT.",2019,[],5
1905.03384,astro-ph,"We present spatially resolved millimeter maps of Neptune between 95 and 242 GHz taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in equation. The millimeter weighting functions peak between 1 and 10 bar on Neptune, lying in between the altitudes probed at visible/infrared and centimeter wavelengths. Thus, these observations provide important constraints on the atmospheric structure and dynamics of Neptune.   We identify seven well-resolved latitudinal bands of discrete brightness temperature variations, on the order of equationK in all three observed ALMA spectral bands. We model Neptune's brightness temperature using the radiative transfer code Radio-BEAR and compare how various HequationS, CHequation, and \textitortho/para Hequation abundance profiles can fit the observed temperature variations across the disk. We find that observed variations in brightness temperature with latitude can be explained by variations in the HequationS profile that range from sub- to super-saturations at altitudes above the 10-bar pressure level, while variations in CHequation improve the quality of fit near the equator. At the south polar cap, our best fit model has a depleted deep atmospheric abundance of HequationS from 30 to only 1.5 times the protosolar value, while simultaneously depleting the CHequation abundance. This pattern of enhancement and depletion of condensable species is consistent with a global circulation structure where enriched air rises at the mid-latitudes (equationS) and north of the equator (equationN), and dry air descends at the poles (equationS) and just south of the equator (equationSequationN). Our analysis finds more complex structure near the equator than accounted for in previous circulation models.",2019,[],5
1911.10880,astro-ph,"We use hydrodynamics and radiative transfer simulations to study the 21~cm signal around a bright QSO at equation. Due to its powerful UV and X-ray radiation, the QSO quickly increases the extent of the fully ionized bubble produced by the pre-existing stellar type sources, in addition to partially ionize and heat the surrounding gas. As expected, a longer QSO lifetime, equation, results in a 21~cm signal in emission located at increasingly larger angular radii, equation, and covering a wider range of equation. Similar features can be obtained with a higher galactic emissivity efficiency, equation, so that determining the origin of a large ionized bubble (i.e. QSO vs stars) is not straightforward. Such degeneracy could be reduced by taking advantage of the finite light traveltime effect, which is expected to affect an HII region produced by a QSO differently from one created by stellar type sources. From an observational point of view, we find that the 21 cm signal around a QSO at various equation could be detected by SKA1-low with a high signal-noise ratio (S/N). As a reference, for equation, a S/N equation is expected assuming that no pre-heating of the IGM has taken place due to high-equation energetic sources, while it can reach value above 10 in case of pre-heating. Observations of the 21~cm signal from the environment of a high-equation bright QSO could then be used to set constraints on its lifetime, as well as to reduce the degeneracy between equation and equation.",2019,[],5
1906.05649,astro-ph,"We explore to what extent simple algebraic models can be used to describe H II regions when winds, radiation pressure, gravity and photon breakout are included. We a) develop algebraic models to describe the expansion of photoionised H II regions under the influence of gravity and accretion in power-law density fields with equation, b) determine when terms describing winds, radiation pressure, gravity and photon breakout become significant enough to affect the dynamics of the H II region where equation, and c) solve these expressions for a set of physically-motivated conditions. We find that photoionisation feedback from massive stars is the principal mode of feedback on molecular cloud scales, driving accelerating outflows from molecular clouds in cases where the peaked density structure around young massive stars is considered at radii between equation0.1 and 10-100 pc. Under a large range of conditions the effect of winds and radiation on the dynamics of H II regions is around 10% of the contribution from photoionisation. The effect of winds and radiation pressure are most important at high densities, either close to the star or in very dense clouds such as those in the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way. Out to equation0.1 pc they are the principal drivers of the H II region. Lower metallicities make the relative effect of photoionisation even stronger as the ionised gas temperature is higher.",2019,[],5
1910.09565,astro-ph,"Measurements of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) hold the promise of yielding unique insights into cosmology at high redshift. Uncertainties due to baryonic effects associated with galaxy formation and evolution, including gas cooling, star formation, and feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and supernovae, have typically been neglected when forecasting the sensitivity of future CMB surveys. In this paper, we determine the impact of these effects using four suites of hydrodynamical simulations which incorporate various prescriptions for baryonic processes, namely OWLS, BAHAMAS, Horizon, and IllustrisTNG. Our analysis shows characteristic power suppressions of several percent in CMB lensing due to baryonic effects, compared to dark-matter only simulations, at experimentally observable angular scales. We investigate the associated bias in the inferred neutrino mass for experiments like the upcoming Simons Observatory and CMB-S4. Depending on the experimental precision and the strength of the baryonic feedback within the simulations, biases in the neutrino mass sum show significant dispersion, ranging from very small to an over-estimation by 1.1equation. We conclude that baryonic effects will likely be non-negligible for a detection of neutrino mass using CMB lensing.",2019,[],5

1907.10542,astro-ph,"We study the evolution of the protoplanetary discs (PPDs) in the presence of magnetically driven winds with the stress relations motivated by the non-ideal MHD disc simulations. Contribution of the magnetic winds in the angular momentum removal and mass loss are described using these relations which are quantified in terms of the plasma parameter. Evolution of the essential disc quantities including the surface density, accretion rate and wind mass loss rate are studied for a wide range of the model parameters. Two distinct phases of the disc evolution are found irrespective of the adopted input parameters. While at the early phase of the disc evolution, global disc quantities such as its total mass and magnetic flux undergo non-significant reductions, their rapid declines are found in the second phase of evolution. Duration of each phase, however, depends upon the model parameters including magnetic wind strength. Our model predicts that contributions of the magnetic winds in the disc evolution are significant during the second phase. We then calculated locus of points in the plane of the accretion rate and total disc mass corresponding to an ensemble of evolving PPDs. Our theoretical isochrone tracks exhibit reasonable fits to the observed PPDs in star forming regions Lupus and equation-Orion.",2019,[],5
1902.01861,astro-ph,"GRB 190114C is the first gamma-ray burst detected at Very High Energies (VHE, i.e. >300 GeV) by the MAGIC Cherenkov telescope. The analysis of the emission detected by the Fermi satellite at lower energies, in the 10 keV -- 100 GeV energy range, up to ~ 50 seconds (i.e. before the MAGIC detection) can hold valuable information. We analyze the spectral evolution of the emission of GRB 190114C as detected by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) in the 10 keV -- 40 MeV energy range up to ~60 sec. The first 4 s of the burst feature a typical prompt emission spectrum, which can be fit by a smoothly broken power-law function with typical parameters. Starting on ~4 s post-trigger, we find an additional nonthermal component, which can be fit by a power law. This component rises and decays quickly. The 10 keV -- 40 MeV flux of the power-law component peaks at ~ 6 s; it reaches a value of 1.7e-5 erg cm-2 s-1. The time of the peak coincides with the emission peak detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board Fermi. The power-law spectral slope that we find in the GBM data is remarkably similar to that of the LAT spectrum, and the GBMLAT spectral energy distribution seems to be consistent with a single component. This suggests that the LAT emission and the power-law component that we find in the GBM data belong to the same emission component, which we interpret as due to the afterglow of the burst. The onset time allows us to estimate the initial jet bulk Lorentz factor Gamma0 is about 500, depending on the assumed circum-burst density.",2019,[],5
1903.06808,astro-ph,"Massive young stellar objects are known to undergo an evolutionary phase in which high mass accretion rates drive strong outflows. A class of objects believed to trace this phase accurately is the GLIMPSE Extended Green Object (EGO) sample, so named for the presence of extended 4.5 equationm emission on sizescales of equation0.1 pc in \textitSpitzer images. We have been conducting a multi-wavelength examination of a sample of 12 EGOs with distances of 1 to 5 kpc. In this paper, we present mid-infrared images and photometry of these EGOs obtained with the SOFIA telescope, and subsequently construct SEDs for these sources from the near-IR to sub-millimeter regimes using additional archival data. We compare the results from greybody models and several publicly-available software packages which produce model SEDs in the context of a single massive protostar. The models yield typical \rstar\/equation10 \rsun, \tstar\/equation10equation to 10equation K, and \lstar\/equation1~equation~40~equation~10equation \lsun; the median equation for our sample is 24.7 \lsun/\msun. Model results rarely converge for \rstar\/ and \tstar, but do for \lstar, which we take to be an indication of the multiplicity and inherently clustered nature of these sources even though, typically, only a single source dominates in the mid-infrared. The median equation value for the sample suggests that these objects may be in a transitional stage between the commonly described 'IR-quiet' and 'IR-bright' stages of MYSO evolution. The median equation for the sample is less conclusive, but suggests that these objects are either in this transitional stage or occupy the cooler (and presumably younger) part of the IR-bright stage.",2019,[],5

Our catalog consists of 1929 broad line AGNs, and 6562 narrow line AGNs which satisfy the \citetKauffmann03 criteria, of which 3607 also satisfy the \citetKewley01 criteria. We also report emission line widths, fluxes, flux errors, and signal-to-noise ratios of all the galaxies in our spectroscopic sample, allowing users to customize the selection criteria. Although we uniformly processed the spectra of galaxies from a homogeneous parent sample, inhomogeneities persist due to the differences in the quality of the obtained spectra, taken with different instruments, and the unavailability of spectra for equation20\% of the galaxies. We quantify how the differences in spectral quality affect not only the AGN detection rates but also broad line to narrow line AGN ratios. We find that the inhomogeneities primarily stem from the continuum signal-to-noise (S/N) in the spectra near the emission lines of interest. We fit for the AGN fraction as a function of continuum S/N and assign AGN likelihoods to galaxies which were not identified as AGNs using the available spectra. This correction results in a catalog suitable for statistical studies. This work also paves the way for a truly homogeneous and complete nearby AGN catalog by identifying galaxies whose AGN status needs to be verified with higher quality spectra, quantifying the spectral quality necessary to do so.",2019,[],5

Here, we present an updated version of the widely-used ANEOS model that includes a user-defined heat capacity limit in the thermal free energy term. Our revised model for forsterite (MgequationSiOequation), a common proxy for the mantles of rocky planets, provides a better fit to material data over most of the phase space of giant impacts.

1901.00890,astro-ph,"Using a recent census of flare stars from the Kepler survey, we have explored how flare activity evolves across stellar main sequence lifetimes. We utilize a sample of 347 stars with robust flare activity detections, and which have rotation periods measured via starspot modulations in their Kepler light curves. We consider three separate methods for quantifying flare activity from optical light curves, and compare their utility for comparing flare activity between stars of differing ages and luminosities. These metrics include: the fractional luminosity emitted in flares, the specific rate of flares emitted at a given energy, and a model for the entire flare frequency distribution. With all three approaches we find that flare activity decreases for all low-mass stars as they spin-down, and thus with age. Most striking is the evolution of the flare occurrence frequency distributions, which show no significant change in the power law slope with age. Since our sample is preferentially constructed of younger, more active stars, our model over-predicts the super-flare rate previously estimated for the Sun. Finally, we parameterize our best-fit model of the flare frequency distribution for ease in predicting the rates of flares and their associated impacts on planet habitability and detection.",2019,[],5
1911.08325,astro-ph,"Fiber modal noise is a performance limiting factor in high-precision radial velocity measurements with multi-mode fiber-fed high-resolution spectrographs. Traditionally, modal noise is mitigated by agitating the fiber, this way redistributing the light that propagates in the fiber over many different modes. However, in case of fibers with only a limited number of modes, e.g. at near-infrared wavelengths or in adaptive-optics assisted systems, this method becomes very inefficient. The strong agitation that would be needed stresses the fiber and can lead to focal ratio degradation. As an alternative approach, we propose to use a classic optical double scrambler and to rotate the scrambler's first fiber end during each exposure. Because of the rotating illumination pattern of the scrambler's second fiber, the modes that are excited vary continuously. This leads to very efficient averaging of the modal pattern at the fiber exit and to a strong reduction of modal noise. In this contribution, we present a prototype design and first laboratory results of the rotating double scrambler.",2019,[],5
1908.11234,astro-ph,"Aims: We present a comprehensive study of the supernova remnant (SNR) population of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We measure multiwavelength properties of the SMC SNRs and compare them to those of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) population. Methods: This study combines the large dataset of XMM-Newton observations of the SMC, archival and recent radio continuum observations, an optical line emission survey, and new optical spectroscopic observations. We can thus build a complete and clean sample of 19 confirmed and 4 candidate SNRs. The homogeneous X-ray spectral analysis allows to search for SN ejecta and Fe K line emission, and to measure interstellar medium (ISM) abundances. We estimate the ratio of core-collapse to type Ia supernova rates of the SMC based on the X-ray properties and the local stellar environment of each SNR. Results : After the removal of unconfirmed or misclassified objects, and the addition of two newly confirmed SNRs based on multi-wavelength features, we present a final list of 21 confirmed SNRs and 2 candidates. While no Fe K line is detected even for the brightest and youngest SNR, we find X-ray evidence of SN ejecta in 11 SNRs. We estimate a ratio of 4.7equation core-collapse supernova to every type Ia SN, three times higher than in the LMC. The difference can be ascribed to the absence of the enhanced star formation episode in the SMC, which occurred in the LMC 0.5-1.5 Gyr ago. The hot-gas abundances of O, Ne, Mg, and Fe are 0.1-0.2 times solar. Their ratios with respect to SMC stellar abundances reflect the effects of dust depletion and partial dust destruction in SNR shocks. We find evidence that the ambient medium probed by SMC SNRs is less disturbed and less dense on average than in the LMC, consistent with the different morphologies of the two galaxies.",2019,[],5
1902.00723,astro-ph,"We recently found that regular orbits in axially symmetric galactic disks have their envelopes equation accurately described by the relation equation, if their amplitudes are comparable to the disk thickness, where equation is the surface density of the disk (integrated over its whole vertical range). Moreover, the usual adiabatic approximation gives a good description of the orbits' envelopes for low vertical amplitudes. However, these two approaches are apparently disconnected, since their expressions differ qualitatively. Our purpose in this paper is to fill this gap by extending these previous formulae to regular orbits with arbitrary vertical amplitudes inside the disk. We compare existing equation estimates: the razor-thin disk case, the adiabatic approximation (low-amplitude orbits in three-dimensional disks), and the integrated surface-density estimate (high-amplitude orbits in three-dimensional disks) in order to establish a connection between them. The formula presented here links the aforementioned results in an elegant and continuous way, being valid for vertical amplitudes throughout the whole vertical extension of the disk and with an expression which has the same form for all regimes. The advantage of the present formalism is the dependence of equation only on observable quantities, namely the disk's vertically integrated surface density, without the need to obtain the gravitational potential for the system.",2019,[],5
1910.03165,astro-ph,"Cosmic Dawn, when the first stars and proto-galaxies began to form, is commonly expected to be accompanied by an absorption signature at radio frequencies. This feature arises as Lyman-equation photons emitted by these first luminous objects couple the 21 cm excitation temperature of intergalactic hydrogen gas to its kinetic temperature, driving it into absorption relative to the CMB. The detailed properties of this absorption profile encode powerful information about the physics of Cosmic Dawn. Recently, Bowman et al. analysed data from the EDGES low-band radio antenna and found an unexpectedly deep absorption profile centred at 78 MHz, which could be a detection of this signature. Their specific analysis fit their measurements using a polynomial foreground model, a flattened Gaussian absorption profile and a white noise model; we argue that a more accurate model, that includes a detailed noise model and accounting for the effects of plausible calibration errors, is essential for describing the EDGES data set. We perform a Bayesian evidence-based comparison of models of the EDGES low-band data set and find that those incorporating these additional components are decisively preferred. The subset of the best fitting models of the data that include a global signal favour an amplitude consistent with standard cosmological assumptions (A < 209 mK). However, there is not strong evidence to favour models of the data including a global 21 cm signal over those without one. Ultimately, we find that the derivation of robust constraints on astrophysics from the data is limited by the presence of systematics.",2019,[],5
1909.04039,astro-ph,"Ultrafaint dwarf galaxies (equation) are relics of an early phase of galaxy formation. They contain some of the oldest and most metal-poor stars in the Universe which likely formed before the epoch of hydrogen reionisation. These galaxies are so faint that they can only be detected as satellites of the Milky Way. They are so small that they are just barely resolved in current cosmological hydrodynamics simulations. Here we combine very high resolution cosmological equation-body simulations with a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation to study the demographics and spatial distribution of ultrafaint satellites in Milky Way-mass haloes. We show that the abundance of these galaxies is correlated with the assembly history of the host halo: at fixed mass, haloes assembled earlier contain, on average, more ultrafaint satellites today than haloes assembled later. We identify simulated galactic haloes that experience an ancient Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage-like and a recent LMC-like accretion event and find that the former occurs in 33% of the sample and the latter in 9%. Only 3% experience both events and these are especially rich in ultrafaint satellites, most acquired during the ancient accretion event. Our models predict that the radial distribution of satellites is more centrally concentrated in early-forming haloes. Accounting for the depletion of satellites by tidal interactions with the central disc, we find a very good match to the observed radial distribution of satellites in the Milky Way over the entire radial range. This agreement is mainly due to the ability of our model to track 'orphan' galaxies after their subhaloes fall below the resolution limit of the simulation.",2019,[],5
1912.05560,astro-ph,"Young stellar clusters across nearly five orders of magnitude in mass appear to follow a simple mass-radius relationship (MRR), equation, with equation. Here, we develop a simple analytic model to explain this observation. We begin by considering giant molecular clouds near virial equilibrium and subsequently relate the properties of the cluster to those of the cloud. In turn, we relate the cloud properties to those of the large-scale galactic environment. The model predicts an \textitinitial mass-radius relation of constant surface density, equation. It also predicts the initial cluster radius depends on the large-scale gas density equation of the ambient ISM, scaling as equation. We argue that the tendency of observed clusters to fall along lines of shallower MRRs than our initial equation is in fact a combination of two effects. The fact that massive clusters can \textitonly form in high gas-density environments, when combined with the equation scaling we find here, ultimately shallows the global slope at high masses to nearly equation. Meanwhile, at low masses relaxation-driven expansion quickly shallows the MRR. We combine our predicted MRR with a simple population synthesis model and apply it to a range of star-forming environments, from nearby disc galaxies to nuclear starbursts, and find good agreement throughout. We provide quantitative predictions for the radii of proto-globular clusters (GCs) and discuss the implications of the model for GC evolution and survival across cosmic time as well as the dynamical assembly of black hole binaries in stellar clusters.",2019,[],5
1907.10845,astro-ph,"We compare the results of a large grid of N-body simulations with the surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles of the globular clusters equation Cen and NGC 6624. Our models include clusters with varying stellar-mass black hole retention fractions and varying masses of a central intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). We find that an equation Mequation IMBH, whose presence has been suggested based on the measured velocity dispersion profile of equation Cen, predicts the existence of about 20 fast-moving, equation Mequation main-sequence stars with a (1D) velocity equation km/sec in the central 20 arcsec of equation Cen. However no such star is present in the HST/ACS proper motion catalogue of Bellini et al. (2017), strongly ruling out the presence of a massive IMBH in the core of equation Cen. Instead, we find that all available data can be fitted by a model that contains 4.6% of the mass of equation Cen in a centrally concentrated cluster of stellar-mass black holes. We show that this mass fraction in stellar-mass BHs is compatible with the predictions of stellar evolution models of massive stars.   We also compare our grid of equation-body simulations with NGC 6624, a cluster recently claimed to harbor a 20,000 Mequation black hole based on timing observations of millisecond pulsars. However, we find that models with equation Mequation IMBHs are incompatible with the observed velocity dispersion and surface brightness profile of NGC 6624,ruling out the presence of a massive IMBH in this cluster. Models without an IMBH provide again an excellent fit to NGC 6624.",2019,[],5
1903.06541,astro-ph,"For high contrast imaging systems, the time delay is one of the major limiting factors for the performance of the extreme adaptive optics (AO) sub-system and, in turn, the final contrast. The time delay is due to the finite time needed to measure the incoming disturbance and then apply the correction. By predicting the behavior of the atmospheric disturbance over the time delay we can in principle achieve a better AO performance. Atmospheric turbulence parameters which determine the wavefront phase fluctuations have time-varying behavior. We present a stochastic model for wind speed and model time-variant atmospheric turbulence effects using varying wind speed. We test a low-order, data-driven predictor, the linear minimum mean square error predictor, for a near-infrared AO system under varying conditions. Our results show varying wind can have a significant impact on the performance of wavefront prediction, preventing it from reaching optimal performance. The impact depends on the strength of the wind fluctuations with the greatest loss in expected performance being for high wind speeds.",2019,[],5
1912.06621,astro-ph,"Detecting primordial non-Gaussianity on mildly non-linear scales requires precise modelling of late-time structure formation. Accurately predicting the impact of non-linear gravitational collapse, non-linear tracer bias and baryonic physics on the variance and higher order moments of the cosmic density field is challenging, as they strongly depend on the tails of the probability distribution function (PDF) of density fluctuations. A way around this problem is to directly analyse the bulk of the PDF instead. For this purpose we devise a new method to predict the impact of general non-Gaussian initial conditions on the late-time density PDF. With this formalism we show that - even when marginalizing over potential ignorance of the amplitude and slope of the non-linear power spectrum - an analysis of the PDF at mildly non-linear densities can measure the amplitude of different primordial bispectrum shapes to an accuracy of equation. This assumes a joint analysis of the PDF on smoothing scales of equationMpc/equation and equationMpc/equation in a survey volume of equation at equation, analysing only densities of equation (equation of probability) and equation (equation of probability). Note that a formalism closely related to ours was already successfully applied to observational data \citepGruen2018, Friedrich2018, demonstrating that the methodology developed here can indeed be carried over to real data analysis.",2019,[],5

To this purpose, we present a detailed analysis of the point-like X-ray sources in the Bullet cluster field. Thanks to equation ks Chandra observations, we produced a catalogue of 381 X-ray point sources up to a distance of equation1.5 virial radius and with flux limits equation and equation erg cmequation sequation in the 0.5-2 keV and 2-10 keV bands, respectively. We found a strong (up to a factor 1.5-2) and significant (equation4equation) over-density in the full region studied equation. We identified optical and infrared counterparts for equation84% and equation48% of the X-ray sources, respectively. We obtained new spectroscopic redshifts for 106 X-ray sources. Spectroscopic and photometric redshifts of optical and infrared sources have been also collected, and these sources were used as ancillary samples. We find that the over-density in the region equation is likely due to X-ray AGN (mostly obscured) and star-forming galaxies both associated to the cluster, while in the more external region it is likely mostly due to background AGN. The fraction of cluster galaxies hosting an X-ray detected AGN is 1.0equation0.4equation, nearly constant with the radius, a fraction similar to that reported in other clusters of galaxies at similar redshift. The fraction of X-ray bright AGN (Lequationequation10equation ergs sequation) in the region equation is equationequation, higher than that in other clusters at similar redshift and more similar to the AGN fraction in the field. Finally, the spatial distributions of AGN and star-forming galaxies, selected also thanks to their infrared emission, appear similar, thus suggesting that both are triggered by the same mechanism.",2019,[],5
1903.05317,astro-ph,"There are two planetary formation scenarios: core accretion and gravitational disk instability. Based on the fact that gaseous objects are preferentially observed around metal-rich host stars, most extra-solar gaseous objects discovered to date are thought to have been formed by core accretion. Here, we present 569 samples of gaseous planets and brown dwarfs found in 485 planetary systems that span three mass regimes with boundary values at 4 and 25 Jupiter-mass masses through performing cluster analyses of these samples regarding the host-star metallicity, after minimizing the impact of the selection effect of radial-velocity measurement on the cluster analysis. The larger mass is thought to be the upper mass limit of the objects that were formed during the planetary formation processes. In contrast, the lower mass limit appears to reflect the difference between planetary formation processes around early-type and G-type stars; disk instability plays a greater role in the planetary formation process around early-type stars than that around G-type stars. Population with masses between 4 and 25 Jupiter masses that orbit early-type stars comprise planets formed not only via the core-accretion process but also via gravitational disk instability because the population preferentially orbits metal-poor stars or is independent of the host-star metallicity. Therefore, it is essential to have a hybrid scenario for the planetary formation of the diverse systems.",2019,[],5

By selecting starting events in the southern sky, atmospheric muons and neutrinos with accompanying muons are rejected, producing a sample with high astrophysical neutrino purity at lower energies than northern sky samples. Our new selection method looks for muon tracks from a neutrino interaction with a vertex contained inside the detector volume by using the good pointing resolution of the track morphology to create an event specific veto region in the detector to reject entering tracks. This starting track event selection has a high astrophysical neutrino purity above 10 TeV at declinations less than -30equation which makes it ideal for use as a southern sky realtime neutrino alert stream. We will discuss neutrino point source searches using this event selection and look at the advantages of the starting track alert stream for multimessenger astrophysics.",2019,[],5
1909.09661,astro-ph,"We present a kinematic and spectroscopic analysis of 38 red giant branch stars, in 7 fields, spanning the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Andromeda XXVII and the upper segment of the North West Stream. Both features are located in the outer halo of the Andromeda galaxy at a projected radius of 50-80 kpc, with the stream extending for equation3equation on the sky. Our data is obtained as part of the PAndAS survey and enables us to confirm that Andromeda XXVII's heliocentric distance is 827 equation 47 kpc and spectroscopic metallicity is -2.1equation. We also re-derive Andromeda XXVII's kinematic properties, measuring a systemic velocity = -526.1equation\kms and a velocity dispersion that we find to be non-Gaussian but for which we derive a formal value of 27.0equation\kms. In the upper segment of the North West Stream we measure mean values for the metallicity = -1.8equation0.4, systemic velocity = -519.4 equation4.0\kms and velocity dispersion = 10.0equation4.0\kms. We also detect a velocity gradient of 1.7equation0.3 \kms kpcequation on an infall trajectory towards M31. With a similar gradient, acting in the same direction, in the lower segment we suggest that the North West Stream is not a single structure.

1910.01366,astro-ph,"The nature of the first massive stars may be inferred by investigating the origin of the extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars, likely formed from the ejecta of one or a few previous massive stars. We investigate the rotational properties of early massive stars by comparing the abundance patterns of EMP stars with rotating massive stellar models. Low metallicity 20 equation stellar models with initial rotation rates between 0 and equation of the critical velocity are computed. Explosions with strong fallback are assumed. The ejected material is considered to fit individually the abundance patterns of 272 EMP stars with equation [Fe/H] equation. With increasing initial rotation, the [C/H], [N/H], [O/H], [Na/H], [Mg/H] and [Al/H] ratios in the massive star ejecta are gradually increased. Among the 272 EMP stars considered, equation are consistent with our models. About equation of the CEMP star sample is reproduced against equation for the C-normal EMP star sample. The CEMP stars are preferentially reproduced with a material coming from mid to fast rotating massive stars. The velocity distribution derived from the best massive star models increases from no rotation to fast rotation. The maximum is reached for massive stars having initial equatorial velocities of equation km~sequation. Although subject to significant uncertainties, these results suggest that the rotational mixing operating in between the H-burning shell and the He-burning core of early massive stars played an important role in the early chemical enrichment of the Universe. The comparison of the velocity distribution derived from the best massive star models with velocity distributions of nearby OB stars suggests a greater amount of massive fast rotators in the early Universe. This may have important consequences for reionization or integrated light from high redshift galaxies.",2019,[],5

Furthermore, the kinematics places this object on a highly retrograde orbit driven by the accretion of a dwarf galaxy onto the Milky Way that occurred at a red shift greater than 1.5.

1909.01922,astro-ph,"Magnetars are regarded as the most magnetized neutron stars in the Universe. Aiming to unveil what kinds of stars and supernovae can create magnetars, we have performed a state-of-the-art spatially resolved spectroscopic X-ray study of the supernova remnants (SNRs) Kes 73, RCW 103, and N49, which host magnetars 1E 1841-045, 1E 161348-5055, and SGR 0526-66, respectively. The three SNRs are O- and Ne-enhanced and are evolving in the interstellar medium with densities of >1--2 cmequation. The metal composition and dense environment indicate that the progenitor stars are not very massive. The progenitor masses of the three magnetars are constrained to be < 20 Msun (11--15 Msun for Kes 73, < 13 Msun for RCW 103, and ~13 --17 Msun for N49). Our study suggests that magnetars are not necessarily made from very massive stars, but originate from stars that span a large mass range. The explosion energies of the three SNRs range from equation erg to ~2equation erg, further refuting that the SNRs are energized by rapidly rotating (millisecond) pulsars. We report that RCW 103 is produced by a weak supernova explosion with significant fallback, as such an explosion explains the low explosion energy (~equation erg), small observed metal masses (equation Msun and equation Msun), and sub-solar abundances of heavier elements such as Si and S. Our study supports the fossil field origin as an important channel to produce magnetars, given the normal mass range (equation Msun) of the progenitor stars, the low-to-normal explosion energy of the SNRs, and the fact that the fraction of SNRs hosting magnetars is consistent with the magnetic OB stars with high fields.",2019,[],5

We compute the shock strength using density jumps to conclude that the Mach number of the merging subcluster is small (equation). We also present pseudo-density, projected temperature, pseudo-pressure, and pseudo-entropy maps. Based on the pseudo-entropy map we conclude that the cluster is undergoing a mild merger, consistent with the small Mach number.

1903.08790,astro-ph,"Recently, Rastall gravity is undergoing a significant surge in popularity. We obtain a power-law total mass-density profile for the inner region (within several effective radius) of early-type galaxies (ETGs) from the space-time structures which are described by the static spherically-symmetric solutions of Rastall gravity under the assumption of perfect fluid matter. We find that in the inner region of ETGs, the Rastall dimensionless parameter equation determines the mass distribution. We then use 118 galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lensing systems to constrain the Rastall dimensionless parameter equation. We find that the mean value of equation for total 118 ETGs is equation(68\% CL) with a minor intrinsic scatter of equation. Our work observationally illustrates the physical meaning of the Rastall dimensionless parameter in galaxy scale. From the Newtonian approximation of Rastall gravity, we also find that an absolute isothermal mass distribution for ETGs is not allowed in the framework of Rastall gravity.",2019,[],5
1903.07691,astro-ph,"Determining the distribution and spectral signature of volatile ices and organics exposed on icy body surfaces can provide crucial clues for deciphering how the outer solar system formed and evolved. Over the past few decades, ground- and space-based telescope observations have probed the compositions of a wide range of icy objects with primordial and processed surfaces, revealing the presence of numerous volatile ices and organic residues. Although these telescope observations have advanced our understanding of icy bodies beyond Saturn, the sensitivity and spatial resolution of collected datasets are limited by the large heliocentric distances of these far-flung objects. Furthermore, most observations have focused on the visible (VIS, 0.4 - 0.7 microns) and near-infrared (NIR, 0.7 - 2.5 microns), with fewer observations at longer NIR wavelengths (2.5 - 5.0 microns) and in the far to near ultraviolet (UV, 0.1 - 0.4 microns), which represents a critical wavelength region for investigating modification of ices and organics by UV photolysis and charged particle radiolysis. Thus, our understanding of icy bodies beyond Saturn is limited by the capabilities of available facilities, and key questions regarding their surface compositions remain to be explored. Next generation space telescopes (NGSTs) with greater sensitivity and angular resolution in the UV, VIS, and longer NIR are therefore needed to help unveil the surface compositions of icy bodies residing at the fringes of our solar system.",2019,[],5
1911.12769,astro-ph,"Gigahertz-Peaked spectrum (GPS) sources are compact active galactic nuclei, presumably young precursors of bright radio sources. The study of GPS radio properties provides information about the features of synchrotron radiation in extragalactic sources. Also in applied research GPS sources are useful as compact stationary radio sources in the sky for astrometric purposes. This paper presents the results of a multifrequency GPS study based on quasi-simultaneous measurements with the RATAN-600 radio telescope during the 2006-2017. The catalog containing spectral flux densities measured at six frequencies (1.1, 2.3, 4.8, 7.7/8.2, 11.2, and 21.7 GHz) have been obtained. In addition, for the analysis of radio spectra, data from the following low-frequency surveys have been used: GLEAM (GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison widefield array survey) and TGSS (Tata institute for fundamental research GMRT Sky Survey) and high-frequency measurements from Planck survey. A total number of 164 GPS and candidates to GPS have been identified (17 of them are new discoveries), which makes up a small fraction of GPS in the initial sample of bright AGNs, about 2%. The physical properties and formation conditions of synchrotron radiation is found to be quite different in GPS of different AGN types. The deficit of distant GPS (equation) with low maximum frequencies (less than 1 GHz) is confirmed. The existing 'size - peak frequency' anticorrelation is continuous.

The systematic-free nature of this analysis is confirmed by two elements: the successful cross-correlation with the gravitational lensing observations derived from Planck 2018 data and the absence of bias at scales equation Mpcequation in the a posteriori power spectrum of recovered initial conditions. Our analysis builds upon our algorithm for Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) and uses a physical model of cosmic structure formation to infer physically meaningful cosmic structures and their corresponding dynamics from deep galaxy observations. Our approach accounts for redshift-space distortions and light-cone effects inherent to deep observations. We also apply detailed corrections to account for known and unknown foreground contaminations, selection effects and galaxy biases.

1912.13223,astro-ph,"The tilt of bipolar magnetic region (BMR) is crucial in the Babcock--Leighton process for the generation of the poloidal magnetic field in Sun. Based on the thin flux tube model of the BMR formation, the tilt is believed to be caused by the Coriolis force acting on the rising flux tube of the strong toroidal magnetic field from the base of the convection zone (BCZ). We analyze the magnetic field dependence of BMR tilts using the magnetograms of Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) (1996-2011) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) (2010-2018). We observe that the distribution of the maximum magnetic field (equation) of BMRs is bimodal. Its first peak at the low field corresponds to BMRs which do not have sunspots as counterparts in the white light images, whereas the second peak corresponds to sunspots as recorded in both types of images. We find that the slope of Joy's law (equation) initially increases slowly with the increase of equation. However, when equation kG, equation decreases. Scatter of BMR tilt around Joy's law systematically decreases with the increase of equation. The decrease of observed equation with equation provides a hint to a nonlinear tilt quenching in the Babcock--Leighton process.

1908.04504,astro-ph,"Adaptive optics (AO) systems deliver high-resolution images that may be ideal for precisely measuring positions of stars (i.e. astrometry) if the system has stable and well-calibrated geometric optical distortions. A calibration unit, equipped with back-illuminated pinhole mask, can be utilized to measure instrumental optical distortions. AO systems on the largest ground-based telescopes, such as the W. M. Keck Observatory and the Thirty Meter Telescope require pinhole positions known to 20 nm to achieve an astrometric precision of 0.001 of a resolution element. We characterize a photo-lithographic pinhole mask and explore the systematic errors that result from different experimental setups. We characterized the nonlinear geometric distortion of a simple imaging system using the mask; and we measured 857 nm RMS of optical distortion with a final residual of 39 nm (equivalent to 20 letteras for TMT). We use a sixth order bivariate Legendre polynomial to model the optical distortion and allow the reference positions of the individual pinholes to vary. The nonlinear deviations in the pinhole pattern with respect to the manufacturing design of a square pattern are 47.2 nm /- 4.5 nm (random) /- 10.8 nm (systematic) over an area of 1788 mmequation. These deviations reflect the additional error induced when assuming the pinhole mask is manufactured perfectly square. We also find that ordered mask distortions are significantly more difficult to characterize than random mask distortions as the ordered distortions can alias into optical camera distortion. Future design simulations for astrometric calibration units should include ordered mask distortions. We conclude that photo-lithographic pinhole masks are >10 times better than the pinhole masks deployed in first generation AO systems and are sufficient to meet the distortion calibration requirements for the upcoming thirty meter class telescopes.",2019,[],5

1901.11136,astro-ph,"We calculate the evolution of massive stars, which undergo pulsational pair-instability (PPI) when the O-rich core is formed. The evolution from the main-sequence through the onset of PPI is calculated for stars with the initial masses of equation equation and metallicities of equation equation. Because of mass loss, equation equation is necessary for stars to form He cores massive enough (i.e., mass equation) to undergo PPI. The hydrodynamical phase of evolution from PPI through the beginning of Fe core collapse is calculated for the He cores with masses of equation and equation. During PPI, electron-positron pair production causes a rapid contraction of the O-rich core which triggers explosive O-burning and a pulsation of the core. We study the mass dependence of the pulsation dynamics, thermodynamics, and nucleosynthesis. The pulsations are stronger for more massive He cores and result in such a large amount of mass ejection such as equation equation for equation He cores. These He cores eventually undergo Fe-core collapse. The equation He core undergoes complete disruption and becomes a pair-instability supernova. The H-free circumstellar matter ejected around these He cores is massive enough for to explain the observed light curve of Type I (H-free) superluminous supernovae with circumstellar interaction.

We addressed several sources of systematic and random error in measurements of total galaxy light, photometric redshift and absolute magnitude. We have found that the equation-band luminosity density for both red and blue galaxies increased by a factor of 1.2 from equation to equation, while the most luminous red (blue) galaxies decreased in luminosity by 0.19 (0.33) mag or equation. These results are consistent with equation studies while our large sample size and area result in smaller Poisson and cosmic variance uncertainties than most equation luminosity and mass function measurements. Using an evolving relation for equation-band mass to light ratios as a function of equation color, we found a slowly decreasing rate of growth in red galaxy stellar mass density of equation from equation to equation, indicating a slowly decreasing rate of migration from the blue cloud to the red sequence. Unlike some studies of the stellar mass function, we find that massive red galaxies grow by a factor of equation from equation to equation, with the rate of growth due to mergers decreasing with time. These results are comparable with measurements of merger rates and clustering, and they are also consistent with the red galaxy stellar mass growth implied by comparing equation-band luminosity evolution with the fading of passive stellar population models.",2019,[],5
1902.00998,astro-ph,"The Milky Way's neutral hydrogen (HI) disk is warped and flared. However, a dearth of accurate HI-based distances has thus far prevented the development of an accurate Galactic disk model. Moreover, the extent to which our Galaxy's stellar and gas disk morphologies are mutually consistent is also unclear. Classical Cepheids, primary distance indicators with distance accuracies of 3-5%, offer a unique opportunity to develop an intuitive and accurate three-dimensional picture. Here, we establish a robust Galactic disk model based on 1339 classical Cepheids. We provide strong evidence that the warp's line of nodes is not oriented in the Galactic Center-Sun direction. Instead, it subtends a mean angle of 17.5  1 (formal)  3 (systematic) and exhibits a leading spiral pattern. Our Galaxy thus follows Briggs' rule for spiral galaxies, which suggests that the origin of the warp is associated with torques forced by the massive inner disk.

1910.06479,astro-ph,"About 4000 exoplanets have been confirmed since the year of 1992, and for most of the planets, the main parameters that can be measured are planetary radius and mass. Based on these two parameters, surface gravity can be estimated. In this work, we investigate the effects of varying radius and gravity on the climate of rapidly rotating terrestrial planets with assuming they have an ocean and Earth-like atmospheres (Nequation, COequation, and HequationO). Using a three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric general circulation model (GCM), we find that varying radius mainly influences the equator-to-pole surface temperature difference while varying gravity mainly influences the mean surface temperature. For planets of larger radii, the meridional atmospheric energy transport is weaker, which warms the tropics but cools high latitudes. For planets of larger gravities, the surface is globally cooler due to the fact that saturated vapor pressure depends on air temperature only and column water vapor mass is approximately equal to saturated vapor pressure over gravity multiplied by relative humidity. The relative humidity does not change much in our experiments. Ice albedo and water vapor feedbacks act to further amplify the effects of varying radius and gravity. These results suggest that radius and gravity are important factors for planetary climate, although they are not as critical as stellar flux, atmospheric composition and mass, and rotation rate. Future simulations are required to know how large the radius and gravity could influence the width of the habitable zone using 3D GCMs.",2019,[],5

If measured, this faint signal imprinted by the primordial gravitational wave background, would be an evidence of the inflation epoch and quantify its energy scale, providing a rigorous test of fundamental physics far beyond the reach of accelerators. At the unprecedented sensitivity level that the new generation of CMB experiments aims to reach, every uncontrolled instrumental systematic effect will potentially result in an analysis bias that is larger than the much sought-after CMB B-mode signal. The absolute calibration of the polarisation angle is particularly important in this sense, as any associated error will end up in a leakage from the much larger E modes into B modes. The Crab nebula (Tau A), with its bright microwave synchrotron emission, is one of the few objects in the sky that can be used as absolute polarisation calibrators. In this communication, we review the best current constraints on its polarisation angle from 23 to 353 GHz, at typical angular scales for CMB observations, from WMAP, IRAM XPOL, Planck and NIKA data.

1904.02673,astro-ph,"Recent additions to the population of Long-duration Gamma Ray Burst (LGRB) host galaxies with measured metallicities and host masses allow us to investigate how the distributions of both these properties change with redshift. We form a sample out to z of 2.5 which we show does not have strong redshift dependent populations biases in mass and metallicity measurements. Using this sample, we find a surprising lack of evolution in the LGRB metallicity distribution across different redshifts and in particular the fraction of LGRB hosts with relatively high-metallicity, that is those with 12log(O/H) > 8.4, remains essentially constant out to z = 2.5. This result is at odds with the evolution in the mass metallicity relation of typical galaxies, which become progressively more metal poor with increasing redshift. By converting the measured LGRB host masses and redshifts to expected metallicities using redshift appropriate mass-metallicity relations, we further find that the increase in LGRB host galaxy mass distribution with redshift seen in the Perley et al. (2016) SHOALS sample is consistent with that needed to preserve a non-evolving LGRB metallicity distribution. However, the estimated LGRB host metallicity distribution is at least a quarter dex higher at all redshifts than the measured metallicity distribution. This corresponds to about a factor of two in raw metallicity and resolves much of the difference between the LGRB host metallicity cutoffs determined by Graham & Fruchter (2017) and Perley et al.

For M* > 108 MSun, LSBGs contribute 47, 7 and 6 per cent of the local number, mass and luminosity densities respectively (~85/11/10 per cent for M* > 107 MSun). Today's LSBGs have similar dark-matter fractions and angular momenta to high-surface-brightness galaxies (HSBGs; mu < 23 mag arcsec-2), but larger effective radii (x2.5 for UDGs) and lower fractions of dense, star-forming gas (more than x6 less in UDGs than HSBGs). LSBGs originate from the same progenitors as HSBGs at z > 2. However, LSBG progenitors form stars more rapidly at early epochs. The higher resultant rate of supernova-energy injection flattens their gas-density profiles, which, in turn, creates shallower stellar profiles that are more susceptible to tidal processes. After z ~ 1, tidal perturbations broaden LSBG stellar distributions and heat their cold gas, creating the diffuse, largely gas-poor LSBGs seen today. In clusters, ram-pressure stripping provides an additional mechanism that assists in gas removal in LSBG progenitors. Our results offer insights into the formation of a galaxy population that is central to a complete understanding of galaxy evolution, and which will be a key topic of research using new and forthcoming deep-wide surveys.",2019,[],5
1907.08632,astro-ph,"We have performed a very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) survey of local (z < 0.05) ultra hard X-ray (14-195 keV) selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) using KVN, KaVA, and VLBA. We first executed fringe surveys of 142 BAT-detected AGN at 15 or 22 GHz. Based on the fringe surveys and archival data, we find 10/279 nearby AGN (~4%) VLBI have 22 GHz flux above 30 mJy. This implies that the X-ray AGN with a bright nuclear jet are not common. Among these 10 radio-bright AGN, we obtained 22 GHz VLBI imaging data of our own for four targets and reprocessed archival data for six targets. We find that, although our 10 AGN observed with VLBI span a wide range of pc-scale morphological types, they lie on a tight linear relation between accretion luminosity and nuclear jet luminosity. Our result suggests that a powerful nuclear radio jet correlates with the accretion disc luminosity. We also probed the fundamental plane of black hole activity at VLBI scales (e.g., few milli-arcsecond). The jet luminosity and size distribution among our sample roughly fit into the proposed AGN evolutionary scenario, finding powerful jets after the blow-out phase based on the Eddington ratio (letterEdd)-hydrogen column density (NH) relation. In addition, we find some hints of gas inflow or galaxy-galaxy merger in the majority of our sample. This implies that gas supply via tidal interactions in galactic scale may help the central AGN to launch a powerful parsec-scale jet.",2019,[],5
1909.04523,astro-ph,"Spectroscopy of 333 NGC 6819 stars and Gaia astrometry are used to map Li evolution from the giant branch tip to 0.5 mag below the Li dip. Isochrone comparison with [Fe/H] = -0.04, based upon neural network spectroscopic analysis, produces an age of 2.25 (2.4) Gyr for E(B-V) = 0.16 (0.14) and (m-M) = 12.40 (12.29). Despite originating outside the Li dip, only 10% of single subgiants/giants have measurable Li. Above the Li dip, the limiting A(Li) for single stars is 3.2 /- 0.1 but the lower range is comparable to that found within the dip. The F-dwarf Li dip profile agrees with the Hyades/Praesepe, evolved forward. The Li level among stars populating the plateau fainter than the Li dip is A(Li) = 2.83 /- 0.16; the dispersion is larger than expected from spectroscopic error alone. Comparison of Li and VROT distributions among turnoff stars in NGC 7789, NGC 2506, NGC 3680, and NGC 6819 indicates that rotational spindown from the main sequence is critical in defining the boundaries of the Li dip. For higher mass dwarfs, spindown is likewise correlated with Li depletion, creating a second dip, but at higher mass and on a longer time scale. The Li distribution among evolved stars of NGC 6819 is more representative of the older M67, where subgiant and giant stars emerge from within the Li dip, than the younger NGC 7789, where a broad range in VROT among the turnoff stars likely produces a range in mass among the giants.",2019,[],5
1906.02129,astro-ph,"Cold debris disks (Tequation200 K) are analogues to the dust in the Solar System's Kuiper belt--dust generated from the evaporation and collision of minor bodies perturbed by planets, our Sun, and the local interstellar medium. Scattered light from debris disks acts as both a signpost for unseen planets as well as a source of contamination for directly imaging terrestrial planets, but many details of these disks are poorly understood. We lay out a critical observational path for the study of nearby debris disks that focuses on defining an empirical relationship between scattered light and thermal emission from a disk, probing the dynamics and properties of debris disks, and directly determining the influence of planets on disks.   We endorse the findings and recommendations published in the National Academy reports on Exoplanet Science Strategy and Astrobiology Strategy for the Search for Life in the Universe. This white paper extends and complements the material presented therein with a focus on debris disks around nearby stars. Separate complementary papers are being submitted regarding the inner warm regions of debris disks (Mennesson et al.), the modeling of debris disk evolution (Gaspar et al.), studies of dust properties (Chen et al.), and thermal emission from disks (Su et al.).",2019,[],5
1908.10871,astro-ph,"TESS is finding transiting planet candidates around bright, nearby stars across the entire sky. The large field-of-view, however, results in low spatial resolution, therefore multiple stars contribute to almost every TESS light curve. High-angular resolution imaging can detect the previously unknown companions to planetary candidate hosts that dilute the transit depths, lead to host star ambiguity, and in some cases are the source of false-positive transit signals. We use speckle imaging on SOAR to search for companions to 542 TESS planet candidate hosts in the Southern sky. We provide correction factors for the 117 systems with resolved companions due to photometric contamination. The contamination in TESS due to close binaries is similar to that found in surveys of Kepler planet candidates. For the solar-type population, we find a deep deficit of close binary systems with projected stellar separations less than 100 AU among planet candidate hosts (44 observed binaries compared to 124 expected based on field binary statistics). The close binary suppression among TESS planet candidate hosts is similar to that seen for the more distant Kepler population. We also find a large surplus of the TESS planet candidates in wide binary systems, detected in both SOAR and Gaia DR2 (119 observed binaries compared to 77 expected). These wide binaries host almost exclusively giant planets, however, suggesting orbital migration, caused by perturbations from the stellar companion, may lead to planet-planet scattering and suppress the population of small planets in wide binaries. Both trends are also apparent in the M-dwarf planet candidate hosts.",2019,[],5
1909.02819,astro-ph,"Radio and equation-ray measurements of large lobes of several radio galaxies provide adequate basis for determining whether emission in these widely separated spectral regions is largely by energetic electrons. This is very much of interest as there is of yet no unequivocal evidence for a significant energetic proton component to account for equation-ray emission by neutral pion decay. A quantitative assessment of the proton spectral distribution necessitates full accounting of the local and background radiation fields in the lobes; indeed, doing so in our recent analysis of the spectral energy distribution of the Fornax A lobes considerably weakened previous conclusions on the hadronic origin of the emission measured by the Fermi satellite. We present the results of similar analyses of the measured radio, X-ray and equation-ray emission from the lobes of Centaurus A, Centaurus B, and NGC 6251. The results indicate that the measured equation-ray emission from these lobes can be accounted for by Compton scattering of the radio-emitting electrons off the superposed radiation fields in the lobes; consequently, we set upper bounds on the energetic proton contents of the lobes.",2019,[],5
1907.05785,astro-ph,"In this work, we study the impact of asymmetric dark matter (ADM) on low-mass main-sequence stars in the Milky Way's nuclear star cluster, where the dark matter (DM) density is expected to be orders of magnitude above what is found near the Sun (equation). Using a modified stellar evolution code and considering a DM particle (equation) with a spin-dependent interaction cross section close to the limits allowed by direct detection, we found that the interactions of ADM with baryons in the star's core can have two separate effects on the evolution of these stars: a decrease in the hydrogen burning rate, extending the duration of the main-sequence of stars with equation by a few Gyr; the suppression of the onset of convection in the core of stars with equation and consequent quench of supply for the nuclear reactions. If we consider equation (corresponding to the inner 5 pc of the Milky Way), stars lighter than the Sun will have a main-sequence life span comparable to the current age of the universe. Stars heavier than two solar masses are not sensitive to the DM particles considered here.",2019,[],5
1902.00540,astro-ph,"Dust is ubiquitous in the Universe and its influence on the observed Electromagnetic (EM) radiation needs to be correctly addressed. In recent years it became clear that scattering of EM radiation from interstellar dust grains could change the local properties of the observed Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. Here we consider the relevant processes of emission and scattering of EM radiation from spinning dust particles, and discuss their possible influence on the CMB. In particular, we show that scattered radiation can establish a correlation between different spectral components of galactic dipolar emission. This could explain the observed correlation between the CMB and the 100-micron thermal emission form interstellar dust. Another important property of CMB is related with its polarisation anisotropies, and the observation of a cosmological B-mode. We show that scattering of CMB radiation from dust grains in the presence of a static magnetic field could indeed create a B-mode spectral component, which is very similar to that due to primordial gravitational waves. This can be described by a kind of Cotton-Mutton effect on the CMB radiation.",2019,[],5
1910.01061,astro-ph,"Reverberation mapping (RM) is one of the most efficient ways to investigate the broad-line region around the central supermassive black holes of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). A common way of performing the RM is to perform a long term spectroscopic monitoring of AGNs, but the spectroscopic monitoring campaign of a large number of AGNs requires an extensive amount of observing time of medium to large size telescopes. As an alternative way, we present the results of photometric RM with medium-band photometry. As the widths of medium-band filters match well with the widths of AGN broad emission lines, the medium-band observation with small telescopes can be a cost-effective way to perform RM. We monitored five nearby AGNs with available spectroscopic RM results showing days to weeks scale variability. Observations were performed for ~3 months with an average of 3 days cadence using three medium-band filters on a 0.43 m telescope. The time lags between the continuum and the H-alpha emission line light curves are calculated using the JAVELIN software and the discrete correlation function. We find time lags of 1.5-15.9 days for these AGNs, which are consistent with the time lags derived from previous spectroscopic RM measurements. This result demonstrates that even a 0.5 m class telescope can perform RM with medium-bands. Furthermore, we show that RM for tens of thousands AGNs is possible with a dedicated 1 m class telescope.",2019,[],5
1904.07947,astro-ph,"The discovery of radio pulsars over a half century ago was a seminal moment in astronomy. It demonstrated the existence of neutron stars, gave a powerful observational tool to study them, and has allowed us to probe strong gravity, dense matter, and the interstellar medium. More recently, pulsar surveys have led to the serendipitous discovery of fast radio bursts (FRBs). While FRBs appear similar to the individual pulses from pulsars, their large dispersive delays suggest that they originate from far outside the Milky Way and hence are many orders-of-magnitude more luminous. While most FRBs appear to be one-off, perhaps cataclysmic events, two sources are now known to repeat and thus clearly have a longer-lived central engine. Beyond understanding how they are created, there is also the prospect of using FRBs -- as with pulsars -- to probe the extremes of the Universe as well as the otherwise invisible intervening medium. Such studies will be aided by the high implied all-sky event rate: there is a detectable FRB roughly once every minute occurring somewhere on the sky. The fact that less than a hundred FRB sources have been discovered in the last decade is largely due to the small fields-of-view of current radio telescopes. A new generation of wide-field instruments is now coming online, however, and these will be capable of detecting multiple FRBs per day. We are thus on the brink of further breakthroughs in the short-duration radio transient phase space, which will be critical for differentiating between the many proposed theories for the origin of FRBs. In this review, we give an observational and theoretical introduction at a level that is accessible to astronomers entering the field.",2019,[],5
1905.04314,astro-ph,"We infer the properties of massive star populations using the far-ultraviolet stellar continua of 61 star-forming galaxies: 42 at low-z observed with HST and 19 at z~2 from the Megasaura sample. We fit each stellar continuum with a linear combination of up to 50 single age and single metallicity Starburst99 models. From these fits, we derive light-weighted ages and metallicities, which agree with stellar wind and photospheric spectral features, and infer the spectral shapes and strengths of the ionizing continua. Inferred light-weighted stellar metallicities span 0.05-1.5 Zequation and are similar to the measured nebular metallicities. We quantify the ionizing continua using the ratio of the ionizing flux at 900\AA\ to the non-ionizing flux at 1500\AA\ and demonstrate the evolution of this ratio with stellar age and metallicity using theoretical single burst models. These single burst models only match the inferred ionizing continua of half of the sample, while the other half are described by a mixture of stellar ages. Mixed age populations produce stronger and harder ionizing spectra than continuous star formation histories, but, contrary to previous studies that assume constant star formation, have similar stellar and nebular metallicities. Stellar population age and metallicity affect the far-UV continua in different and distinguishable ways; assuming a constant star formation history diminishes the diagnostic power. Finally, we provide simple prescriptions to determine the ionizing photon production efficiency (equation) from the stellar population properties. equation has a range of log(equation Hz ergequation that depends on stellar age, metallicity, star formation history, and contributions from binary star evolution. These stellar population properties must be observationally determined to determine the number of ionizing photons generated by massive stars.",2019,[],5
1910.02075,astro-ph,"In any imaging survey, measuring accurately the astronomical background light is crucial to obtain good photometry. This paper introduces BKGnet, a deep neural network to predict the background and its associated error. BKGnet has been developed for data from the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS), an imaging survey using a 40 narrow-band filter camera (PAUCam). Images obtained with PAUCam are affected by scattered light: an optical effect consisting of light multiply that deposits energy in specific detector regions contaminating the science measurements. Fortunately, scattered light is not a random effect, but it can be predicted and corrected for. We have found that BKGnet background predictions are very robust to distorting effects, while still being statistically accurate. On average, the use of BKGnet improves the photometric flux measurements by 7% and up to 20% at the bright end. BKGnet also removes a systematic trend in the background error estimation with magnitude in the i-band that is present with the current PAU data management method. With BKGnet, we reduce the photometric redshift outlier rate",2019,[],5
1909.06063,astro-ph,"Galaxies host a wide array of internal stellar components, which need to be decomposed accurately in order to understand their formation and evolution. While significant progress has been made with recent integral-field spectroscopic surveys of nearby galaxies, much can be learned from analyzing the large sets of realistic galaxies now available through state-of-the-art hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. We present an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, named auto-GMM, based on Gaussian mixture models, to isolate intrinsic structures in simulated galaxies based on their kinematic phase space. For each galaxy, the number of Gaussian components allowed by the data is determined through a modified Bayesian information criterion. We test our method by applying it to prototype galaxies selected from the cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG. Our method can effectively decompose most galactic structures. The intrinsic structures of simulated galaxies can be inferred statistically by non-human supervised identification of galaxy structures. We successfully identify four kinds of intrinsic structures: cold disks, warm disks, bulges, and halos. Our method fails for barred galaxies because of the complex kinematics of particles moving on bar orbits.",2019,[],5
1904.03724,astro-ph,"Contex: Solar magnetic activity exhibits variations with periods between 1.5--4 years, the so-called quasi-biennial oscillations (QBOs), in addition to the well-known 11-year Schwabe cycles. Solar dynamo is thought to be the responsible mechanism for generation of the QBOs.   Aims: In this work, we analyse sunspot areas to investigate the spatial and temporal behaviour of the QBO signal and study the responsible physical mechanisms using simulations from fully nonlinear mean-field flux-transport dynamos.   Methods: We investigated the behaviour of the QBOs in the sunspot area data in full disk, and northern and southern hemispheres, using wavelet and Fourier analyses. We also ran solar dynamos with two different approaches to generating a poloidal field from an existing toroidal field, Babcock-Leighton and turbulent equation mechanisms. We then studied the simulated magnetic field strengths as well as meridional circulation and differential rotation rates using the same methods.   Results: The results from the sunspot areas show that the QBOs are present in the full disk and hemispheric sunspot areas and they show slightly different spatial and temporal behaviours, indicating a slightly decoupled solar hemispheres. The QBO signal is generally intermittent and in-phase with the sunspot area data, surfacing when the solar activity is in maximum. The results from the BL-dynamos showed that they are neither capable of generating the slightly decoupled behaviour of solar hemispheres nor can they generate QBO-like signals. The turbulent equation-dynamos, on the other hand, generated decoupled hemispheres and some QBO-like shorter cycles.   Conclusions: In conclusion, our simulations show that the turbulent equation-dynamos with the Lorentz force seems more efficient in generating the observed temporal and spatial behaviour of the QBO signal compared with those from the BL-dynamos.",2019,[],5
1903.03045,astro-ph,"We report on a recent (2016-2018) enhancement of the GeV emission from the SN 1987A region as observed with Fermi/LAT. The observed signal is characterised by a power-law spectrum with a slope of 2.1 /- 0.2 and is detected only at energies >1 GeV. The Fermi/LAT data constrain the position of the signal to within 0.15 degree around SN 1987A. Although a recent increase in the gamma-ray emission from SN 1987A seems to be a natural explanation for the detected emission, given the youth of the source and its rapid evolution, the Fermi/LAT location also overlaps with several other potential gamma-ray sources: 30 Dor C, Honeycomb nebula, RX J0536.9-6913, and a hypothetical, previously unknown transient source. We argue that multiwavelength observations of the region performed during the next few years can clarify the nature of the signal and encourage such observations. We also present upper limits on the time-averaged flux of SN 1987A based on 10 years of Fermi/LAT exposure, which can be used to better constrain the particle acceleration models of this source.",2019,[],5

We include the effect of cold dark baryons by scaling the measured mass in the atomic form by a factor of equation in the mass budget of galaxies. In addition to the standard interpolating function, we also fit the RCs and the RAR with the empirical RAR-inspired interpolating function. Slightly better fits for about equation of galaxies in our sample are achieved in the presence of dark baryons (equation) with the mean value of equation.

1910.02622,astro-ph,"Herschel surveys of Galactic clouds support a paradigm for low-mass star formation in which dense filaments play a crucial role. The detailed fragmentation properties of star-forming filaments remain poorly understood, however, and the validity of the filament paradigm in the high-mass regime is still unclear. To investigate the density/velocity structure of the filament in the high-mass star-forming region NGC6334, we conducted ALMA observations in the 3mm continuum and the N2H(1-0) line at ~3arcsec resolution. The filament was detected in both tracers. We identified 26 cores at 3mm and 5 velocity-coherent fiber-like features in N2H within the filament. The typical length of, and velocity difference between, the fiber-like features of the NGC6334 filament are reminiscent of the properties for the fibers of the low-mass star-forming filament B211/B213. Only 2 or 3 of the 5 velocity-coherent features are well aligned with the filament and may represent genuine, fiber sub-structures. The core mass distribution has a peak at ~10Msun. They can be divided into 7 groups of cores, closely associated with ArTeMiS clumps. The projected separation between cores and the projected spacing between clumps are roughly consistent with the effective Jeans length in the filament and a physical scale of about 4 times the filament width, respectively, suggesting a bimodal filament fragmentation process. Despite being one order of magnitude denser and more massive than the B211/B213 filament, the NGC6334 filament has a similar density/velocity structure. The difference is that the cores in NGC6334 appear to be an order of magnitude denser and more massive than the cores in Taurus. This suggests that dense filaments may evolve and fragment in a similar manner in low- and high-mass star-forming regions, and that the filament paradigm may hold in the intermediate-mass (if not high-mass) star formation regime.",2019,[],5
1902.01340,astro-ph,"The core-collapse supernova (CCSN) mechanism is fundamentally three-dimensional with instabilities, convection, and turbulence playing crucial roles in aiding neutrino-driven explosions. Simulations of CCNSe including accurate treatments of neutrino transport and sufficient resolution to capture key instabilities remain amongst the most expensive numerical simulations in astrophysics, prohibiting large parameter studies in 2D and 3D. Studies spanning a large swath of the incredibly varied initial conditions of CCSNe are possible in 1D, though such simulations must be artificially driven to explode. We present a new method for including the most important effects of convection and turbulence in 1D simulations of neutrino-driven CCSNe, called Supernova Turbulence In Reduced-dimensionality, or STIR. Our new approach includes crucial terms resulting from the turbulent and convective motions of the flow. We estimate the strength of convection and turbulence using a modified mixing length theory (MLT) approach introducing a few free parameters to the model which are fit to the results of 3D simulations. For sufficiently large values of the mixing length parameter, turbulence-aided neutrino-driven explosions are obtained. We compare the results of STIR to high-fidelity 3D simulations and perform a parameter study of CCSN explosion using 200 solar-metallicity progenitor models from 9 to 120 equation.

1907.00827,astro-ph,"Terrestrial planets covered globally with thick oceans (termed ocean planets) in the habitable zone were previously inferred to have extremely hot climates in most cases. This is because equation high-pressure (HP) ice on the seafloor prevents chemical weathering and, thus, removal of atmospheric COequation. Previous studies, however, ignored melting of the HP ice and horizontal variation in heat flux from oceanic crusts. Here we examine whether high heat fluxes near the mid-ocean ridge melts the HP ice and thereby removes atmospheric equation. We develop integrated climate models of an Earth-size ocean planet with plate tectonics for different ocean masses, which include the effects of HP ice melting, seafloor weathering, and the carbonate-silicate geochemical carbon cycle. We find that the heat flux near the mid-ocean ridge is high enough to melt the ice, enabling seafloor weathering. In contrast to the previous theoretical prediction, we show that climates of terrestrial planets with massive oceans lapse into extremely cold ones (or snowball states) with COequation-poor atmospheres. Such extremely cold climates are achieved mainly because the HP ice melting fixes seafloor temperature at the melting temperature, thereby keeping a high weathering flux regardless of surface temperature. We estimate that ocean planets with oceans several tens of the Earth's ocean mass no longer maintain temperate climates. These results suggest that terrestrial planets with extremely cold climates exist even in the habitable zone beyond the solar system, given the frequency of water-rich planets predicted by planet formation theories.",2019,[],5

This data release includes the NHequation (1,1) and (2,2) maps for each cloud, which are modeled to produce maps of kinetic temperature, centroid velocity, velocity dispersion, and ammonia column density. Median cloud kinetic temperatures range from equation K in the coldest cloud (MonR1) to equation K in the warmest cloud (M17). Using dendrograms on the NHequation (1,1) integrated intensity maps, we identify 856 dense gas clumps across the eleven clouds. Depending on the cloud observed, equation of the clumps are aligned spatially with filaments identified in Hequation column density maps derived from SED-fitting of dust continuum emission. A virial analysis reveals that 523 of the 835 clumps (equation) with mass estimates are bound by gravity alone. We find no significant difference between the virial parameter distributions for clumps aligned with the dust-continuum filaments and those unaligned with filaments. In some clouds, however, hubs or ridges of dense gas with unusually high mass and low virial parameters are located within a single filament or at the intersection of multiple filaments.

In this work we investigate further the charge replenishment of the ECS. We discovered that the flow of pairs from the rims of the polar caps cannot supply both the electric charge and the electric current of the ECS. The ECS must contain an extra amount of positronic (or electronic depending on orientation) electric current that originates in the stellar surface and flows outwards along the separatrices. We develop an iterative hybrid approach that self-consistently combines ideal force-free electrodynamics in the bulk of the magnetosphere with particle acceleration along the ECS. We derive analytic approximations for the orbits of the particles, and obtain the structure of the pulsar magnetosphere for various values of the pair-formation multiplicity parameter kappa. For realistic values kappa >> 1, the magnetosphere is practically indistinguishable from the ideal force-free one, and therefore, the calculation of the spectrum of high-energy radiation must be based on analytic approximations for the distribution of the accelerating electric field in the ECS.",2019,[],5
1901.04506,astro-ph,"Quasars that exhibit blue-shifted, broad absorption lines (BAL QSOs) are an important probe of black hole feedback on galaxy evolution. Yet the presence of BALs is also a complication for large, spectroscopic surveys that use quasars as cosmological probes because the BAL features can affect redshift measurements and contaminate information about the matter distribution in the Lyman-equation forest. We present a new BAL QSO catalog for quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 14 (DR14). As the SDSS DR14 quasar catalog has over 500,000 quasars, we have developed an automated BAL classifier with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We trained our CNN classifier on the C IV equation region of a sample of quasars with reliable human classifications, and compared the results to both a dedicated test sample and visual classifications from the earlier SDSS DR12 quasar catalog. Our CNN classifier correctly classifies over 98% of the BAL quasars in the DR12 catalog, which demonstrates comparable reliability to human classification. The disagreements are generally for quasars with lower signal-to-noise ratio spectra and/or weaker BAL features. Our new catalog includes the probability that each quasar is a BAL, the strength, blueshifts and velocity widths of the troughs, and similar information for any Si IV equation BAL troughs that may be present. We find significant BAL features in 16.8% of all quasars with equation in the SDSS DR14 quasar catalog.",2019,[],5
1907.07418,astro-ph,"We numerically explore how the subhalo mass-loss evolution is affected by the tidal coherences measured along different eigenvector directions. The mean virial-to-accretion mass ratios of the subhalos are used to quantify the severity of their mass-loss evolutions within the hosts, and the tidal coherence is expressed as an array of three numbers each of which quantifies the alignment between the tidal fields smoothed on the scales of equation and equationMpc in each direction of three principal axes. Using a Rockstar halo catalog retrieved from a N-body simulation, we investigate if and how the mass-loss evolutions of the subhalos hosted by distinct halos at fixed mass scale of [equation-equation]equation are correlated with three components of the tidal coherence. The tides coherent along different eigenvector directions are found to have different effects on the subhalo mass-loss evolution, which cannot be ascribed to the differences in the densities and ellipticities of the local environments. It is shown that the substructures surrounded by the tides highly coherent along the first eigenvector direction and highly \it incoherent along the third eigenvector direction experience the least severe mass-loss evolution, while the tides highly \it incoherent only along the first eigenvector direction is responsible for the most severe mass-loss evolution of the subhalos. Explaining that the coherent tides have an obstructing effect on the satellite infalls onto their hosts and that the strength of the obstruction effect depends on which directions the tides are coherent or \it incoherent along, we suggest that the multidimensional dependence of the substructure evolution on the tidal coherence should be deeply related to the complex nature of the large-scale assembly bias.",2019,[],5
1906.06345,astro-ph,"We present Searches After Gravitational-waves Using ARizona Observatories (SAGUARO), a comprehensive effort dedicated to the discovery and characterization of optical counterparts to gravitational wave (GW) events. SAGUARO utilizes ground-based facilities ranging from 1.5m to 10m in diameter, located primarily in the Northern Hemisphere. We provide an overview of SAGUARO's telescopic resources, pipeline for transient detection, and database for candidate visualization. We describe SAGUARO's discovery component, which utilizes the equation~degequation field-of-view optical imager on the Mt. Lemmon 1.5m telescope, reaching limits of equation~AB mag while rapidly tiling large areas. We also describe the follow-up component of SAGUARO, used for rapid vetting and monitoring of optical candidates. With the onset of Advanced LIGO/Virgo's third observing run, we present results from the first three SAGUARO searches following the GW events S190408an, S190425z and S190426c, which serve as a valuable proof-of-concept of SAGUARO. We triggered and searched 15, 60 and 60 degequation respectively, 17.6, 1.4 and 41.8 hrs after the initial GW alerts. We covered 7.8, 3.0 and 5.1\% of the total probability within the GW event localizations, reaching 3equation limits of 19.8, 21.3 and 20.8 AB mag, respectively. Although no viable counterparts associated with these events were found, we recovered 6 known transients and ruled out 5 potential candidates. We also present Large Binocular Telescope spectroscopy of PS19eq/SN2019ebq, a promising kilonova candidate that was later determined to be a supernova. With the ability to tile large areas and conduct detailed follow-up, SAGUARO represents a significant addition to GW counterpart searches.",2019,[],5
1901.08704,astro-ph,"Intrinsically faint comets in nearly-parabolic orbits with perihelion distances much smaller than 1 AU exhibit strong propensity for suddenly disintegrating at a time not long before perihelion, as shown by Bortle (1991). Evidence from available observations of such comets suggests that the disintegration event usually begins with an outburst and that the debris is typically a massive cloud of dust grains that survives over a limited period of time. Recent CCD observations revealed, however, that also surviving could be a sizable fragment, resembling a devolatilized aggregate of loosely-bound dust grains that may have exotic shape, peculiar rotational properties, and extremely high porosity, all acquired in the course of the disintegration event. Given that the brightness of 1I/`Oumuamua's parent could not possibly equal or exceed the Bortle survival limit, there are reasons to believe that it suffered the same fate as do the frail comets. The post-perihelion observations then do not refer to the object that was entering the inner Solar System in early 2017, as is tacitly assumed, but to its debris. Comparison with C/2017 S3 and C/2010 X1 suggests that, as a monstrous fluffy dust aggregate released in the recent explosive event, `Oumuamua should be of strongly irregular shape, tumbling, not outgassing, and subjected to effects of solar radiation pressure, consistent with observation. The unknown timing of the disintegration event may compromise studies of the parent's home stellar system. Limited search for possible images of the object to constrain the time of the (probably minor) outburst is recommended.",2019,[],5
1906.04644,astro-ph,"The most abundant stars in the Galaxy, M dwarfs, are very commonly hosts to diverse systems of low-mass planets. Their abundancy implies that the general occurrence rate of planets is dominated by their occurrence rate around such M dwarfs. In this article, we combine the M dwarf surveys conducted with the HIRES/Keck, PFS/Magellan, HARPS/ESO, and UVES/VLT instruments supported with data from several other instruments. We analyse the radial velocities of an approximately volume- and brightness-limited sample of 426 nearby M dwarfs in order to search for Doppler signals of cadidate planets. In addition, we analyse spectroscopic activity indicators and ASAS photometry to rule out radial velocity signals corresponding to stellar activity as Doppler signals of planets. We calculate estimates for the occurrence rate of planets around the sample stars and study the properties of this occurrence rate as a function of stellar properties. Our analyses reveal a total of 118 candidate planets orbiting nearby M dwarfs. Based on our results accounting for selection effects and sample detection threshold, we estimate that M dwarfs have on average at least 2.39equation planets per star orbiting them. Accounting for the different sensitivities of radial velocity surveys and Kepler transit photometry implies that there are at least 3.0 planets per star orbiting M dwarfs. We also present evidence for a population of cool mini-Neptunes and Neptunes with indications that they are found an order of magnitude more frequently orbiting the least massive M dwarfs in our sample.",2019,[],5
1909.01527,astro-ph,"We present a novel, relativistic accretion model for accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole. This consists of a purely hydrodynamical mechanism in which, by breaking spherical symmetry, a radially accreting flow transitions into an inflow-outflow configuration. The spherical symmetry is broken by considering that the accreted material is more concentrated on an equatorial belt, leaving the polar regions relatively under-dense. What we have found is a flux-limited accretion regime in which, for a sufficiently large accretion rate, the incoming material chokes at a gravitational bottleneck and the excess flux is redirected by the density gradient as a bipolar outflow. The threshold value at which the accreting material chokes is of the order of the mass accretion rate found in the spherically symmetric case studied by Bondi and Michel. We describe the choked accretion mechanism first in terms of a general relativistic, analytic toy model based on the assumption of an ultrarelativistic stiff fluid. We then relax this approximation and, by means of numerical simulations, show that this mechanism can operate also for general polytropic fluids. Interestingly, the qualitative inflow-outflow morphology obtained appears as a generic result of the proposed symmetry break, across analytic and numeric results covering both the Newtonian and relativistic regimes. The qualitative change in the resulting steady state flow configuration appears even for a very small equatorial to polar density contrast (equation) in the accretion profile. Finally, we discuss the applicability of this model as a jet-launching mechanism in different astrophysical settings.",2019,[],5
1909.11923,astro-ph,"During non-flaring times, the radio flux of the Sun at the wavelength of a few centimeters to several tens of centimeters mostly originates from the thermal bremsstrahlung emission, very similar to the EUV radiation. Owing to such a proximity, it is feasible to investigate the relationship between the EUV emission and radio emission in a quantitative way. In this paper, we reconstruct the radio images of the Sun through the differential emission measure obtained from the multi-wavelength EUV images of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board Solar Dynamic Observatory. Through comparing the synthetic radio images at 6 GHz with those observed by Siberian Radioheliograph, we find that the predicted radio flux is qualitatively consistent with the observed value, confirming thermal origin of the coronal radio emission during non-flaring times. The results further show that the predicted radio flux is closer to the observations in the case of including the contribution of the plasma with temperatures above 3 MK than in the case of only involving the low temperature plasma as was usually done in the era of pre-SDO. We also discuss the applications of the method and uncertainties of the results.",2019,[],5
1901.08066,astro-ph,"We investigate the previously proposed possibility that multi-epoch broadband polarimetry could act as a complement or limited proxy for VLBI observations of blazars, in that the number of polarised emission components in the jet, and some of their properties and those of the foreground environment, might be inferred from the object's time-varying 1D Faraday depth spectrum (FDS) alone. We report on a pilot-scale experiment designed to establish the basic plausibility and utility of this idea. We analyse temporal changes in the complex polarisation spectra of nine spatially unresolved (at arcsecond scales) blazars in two epochs separated by equation5 years, using data taken with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. The data allow for precise modelling, and we demonstrate that all objects in our sample show changes in their polarisation spectrum that cannot be accounted for by uncertainties in calibration or observational effects. By associating polarised emission components across epochs, we infer changes in their number, intrinsic fractional polarisation, intrinsic polarisation angle, rotation measure, and depolarisation characteristics. We attribute these changes to evolution in the structure of the blazar jets, most likely located at distances of up to tens of parsecs from the central active galactic nuclei. Our results suggest that continued work in this area is warranted; in particular, it will be important to determine the frequency ranges and temporal cadence most useful for scientifically exploiting the effects.",2019,[],5
1905.08677,astro-ph,"The Photon Transfer Curve (PTC) of a CCD depicts the variance of uniform images as a function of their average. It is now well established that the variance is not proportional to the average, as Poisson statistics would indicate, but rather flattens out at high flux. This ""variance deficit"", related to the brighter-fatter effect, feeds correlations between nearby pixels, that increase with flux, and decay with distance. We propose an analytical expression for the PTC shape, and for the dependence of correlations with intensity, and relate both to some more basic quantities related to the electrostatics of the sensor, that are commonly used to correct science images for the brighter-fatter effect. We derive electrostatic constraints from a large set of flat field images acquired with a CCD e2v 250, and eventually question the generally-admitted assumption that boundaries of CCD pixels shift by amounts proportional to the source charges. Our results show that the departure of flat field statistics from Poisson law is entirely compatible with charge redistribution during the drift in the sensor.",2019,[],5
1902.04092,astro-ph,"Within the NaCo-ISPY exoplanet imaging program, we aim at detecting and characterizing the population of low-mass companions at wide separations (equation10AU), focusing in particular on young stars either hosting a known protoplanetary disk or a debris disk. R CrA is one of the youngest (1-3 Myr) and most promising objects in our sample because of two previous studies that suggested the presence of a close companion. Our aim is to directly image and characterize the companion for the first time. We observed R CrA twice with the NaCo instrument at VLT in the equation filter with a one year time baseline in between. The high-contrast imaging data were reduced and analyzed, and in both datasets the companion candidate was detected. The companion is detected at a separation of equation/equation mas (equation/equation AU) and position angle of equation in the first/second epoch observation. We measure a contrast of equation/equation mag with respect to the primary. Stellar proper motion study rejects the hypothesis of the signal being a background object. The companion candidate orbits in the clockwise direction and, if on a face-on circular orbit, its period is equation yr. This value disagrees with the estimated orbital motion and therefore a face-on circular orbit may be excluded. Depending on the assumed age, extinction and brightness of the primary, the stellar companion has a mass between equation and equation range, if no contribution from circumsecondary material is taken into account. The presence of the companion needs to be taken into account when analyzing the complex circumstellar environment of R CrA.",2019,[],5
1907.11534,astro-ph,"Numerical models of gas inflow towards a supermassive black hole (SMBH) show that star formation may occur in such an environment through the growth of a gravitationally unstable gas disc. We consider the effect of nuclear activity on such a scenario. We present the first three-dimensional grid-based radiative hydrodynamic simulations of direct collisions between infalling gas streams and a equation SMBH, using ray-tracing to incorporate radiation consistent with an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We assume inflow masses of equation and explore radiation fields of 10% and 100% of the Eddington luminosity (equation). We follow our models to the point of central gas disc formation preceding star formation and use the Toomre Q parameter (equation) to test for gravitational instability. We find that radiation pressure from UV photons inhibits inflow. Yet, for weak radiation fields, a central disc forms on timescales similar to that of models without feedback. Average densities of equation limit photo-heating to the disc surface allowing for equation. For strong radiation fields, the disc forms more gradually resulting in lower surface densities and larger equation values. Mass accretion rates in our models are consistent with 1%--60% of the Eddington limit, thus we conclude that it is unlikely that radiative feedback from AGN activity would inhibit circumnuclear star formation arising from a massive inflow event.",2019,[],5
1912.02599,astro-ph,"We perform an extensive review of the numerous studies and methods used to determine the total mass of the Milky Way. We group the various methods into seven broad classes, including: i) estimating Galactic escape velocity using high velocity objects; ii) measuring the rotation curve through terminal and circular velocities; iii) modeling halo stars, globular clusters and satellite galaxies with the Spherical Jeans equation and iv) with phase-space distribution functions; v) simulating and modeling the dynamics of stellar streams and their progenitors; vi) modeling the motion of the Milky Way, M31 and other distant satellites under the framework of Local Group timing argument; and vii) measurements made by linking the brightest Galactic satellites to their counterparts in simulations. For each class of methods, we introduce their theoretical and observational background, the method itself, the sample of available tracer objects, model assumptions, uncertainties, limits and the corresponding measurements that have been achieved in the past. Both the measured total masses within the radial range probed by tracer objects and the extrapolated virial masses are discussed and quoted. We also discuss the role of modern numerical simulations in terms of helping to validate model assumptions, understanding systematic uncertainties and calibrating the measurements. While measurements in the last two decades show a factor of two scatters, recent measurements using \textitGaia DR2 data are approaching a higher precision. We end with a detailed discussion of future developments, especially as the size and quality of the observational data will increase tremendously with current and future surveys. In such cases, the systematic uncertainties will be dominant and thus will necessitate a much more rigorous testing and characterization of the various mass determination methods.",2019,[],5

In the literature, metallicities in the range between -2.0 and -1.0 have been estimated for Terzan 9 based on color-magnitude diagrams and CaII triplet (CaT) lines.   Methods. Given its compactness, Terzan 9 was observed using the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope. The extraction of spectra from several hundreds of individual stars allowed us to derive their radial velocities, metallicities, and [Mg/Fe]. The spectra obtained with MUSE were analysed through full spectrum fitting using the ETOILE code.   Results.

1906.10703,astro-ph,"Young exoplanets are snapshots of the planetary evolution process. Planets that orbit stars in young associations are particularly important because the age of the planetary system is well constrained. We present the discovery of a transiting planet larger than Neptune but smaller than Saturn in the 45 Myr Tucana-Horologium young moving group. The host star is a visual binary, and our follow-up observations demonstrate that the planet orbits the G6V primary component, DS Tuc A (HD 222259A, TIC 410214986). We first identified transits using photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS; alerted as TOI 200.01). We validated the planet and improved the stellar parameters using a suite of new and archival data, including spectra from SOAR/Goodman, SALT/HRS and LCO/NRES; transit photometry from Spitzer; and deep adaptive optics imaging from Gemini/GPI. No additional stellar or planetary signals are seen in the data. We measured the planetary parameters by simultaneously modeling the photometry with a transit model and a Gaussian process to account for stellar variability. We determined that the planetary radius is equation Earth radii and that the orbital period is 8.1 days. The inclination angles of the host star's spin axis, the planet's orbital axis, and the visual binary's orbital axis are aligned within 15 degrees to within the uncertainties of the relevant data.

1911.02976,astro-ph,"We study the stellar populations of the brightest group galaxies (BGGs) in groups with different dynamical states, using GAMA survey data. We use two independent, luminosity dependent indicators to probe the relaxedness of their groups; the magnitude gap between the two most luminous galaxies (equation), and offset between BGG and the luminosity center (equation) of the group. Combined, these two indicators were previously found useful for identifying relaxed and unrelaxed groups. We find that the BGGs of unrelaxed groups have significantly bluer NUV-r colours than in relaxed groups. This is also true at the fixed sersic index. We find the bluer colours cannot be explained away by differing dust fraction, suggesting there are real differences in their stellar populations. SFRs derived from SED-fitting tend to be higher in unrelaxed systems. This is in part because of a greater fraction of BGGs with non-elliptical morphology, but also because unrelaxed systems have larger numbers of mergers, some of which may bring fuel for star formation. The SED-fitted stellar metallicities of BGGs in unrelaxed systems also tend to be higher by around 0.05 dex, perhaps because their building blocks were more massive. We find that the equation parameter is the most important parameter behind the observed differences in the relaxed/unrelaxed groups, in contrast with the previous study of Trevisan et al. (2017). We also find that groups selected to be unrelaxed using our criteria tend to have higher velocity offsets between the BGG and their group.",2019,[],5

We find that the 2019 outburst shows a pronounced evolution in pulse phase over the course of the outburst. These phase shifts are found to correlate with the source flux, and are interpreted in terms of hot-spot drift on the stellar surface, driven by changes in the mass accretion rate.

1901.10481,astro-ph,"Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) winds from evolved stars not only provide a non-trivial amount of mass and energy return, but also produce dust grains in massive elliptical galaxies. Due to the fast stellar velocity and the high ambient temperature, the wind is thought to form a comet-like tail, similar to Mira in the Local Bubble. Many massive elliptical galaxies and cluster central galaxies host extended dusty cold filaments. The fate of the cold dusty stellar wind and its relation to cold filaments are not well understood. In this work, we carry out both analytical and numerical studies of the interaction between an AGB wind and the surrounding hot gas. We find that the cooling time of the tail is inversely proportional to the ambient pressure. In the absence of cooling, or in low pressure environments (e.g., the outskirts of elliptical galaxies), AGB winds are quickly mixed into the hot gas, and all the AGB winds have similar appearance and head-to-tail ratio. In high pressure environments, such as the Local Bubble and the central regions of massive elliptical galaxies, some of the gas in the mixing layer between the stellar wind and the surrounding hot gas can cool efficiently and cause the tail to become longer. Our simulated tail of Mira itself has similar length and velocity to that observed, and appears similar to the simulated AGB tail in the central regions of massive galaxies. We speculate that instead of thermal instability, the induced condensation at the mixing layer of AGB winds may be the origin of cold filaments in massive galaxies and galaxy clusters. This naturally explains the existence of dust and PAH in the filaments.",2019,[],5

The association of CNSS J001900 with the nucleus (Gaia and our VLBI positions are consistent to within 1 pc) of a nearby S0 Seyfert galaxy at 77 Mpc, together with the radio spectral evolution, implies that this transient is most likely a tidal disruption event (TDE). Our equipartition analysis indicates the presence of a equation15,000 km sequation outflow, having energy equation10equation erg. We derive the radial density profile for the circumnuclear material in the host galaxy to be proportional to equation. All of these properties suggest resemblance with radio-detected thermal TDEs like ASASSN-14li and XMMSL1 J0740-85. No significant X-ray or optical emission is detected from CNSS J001900, although this may simply be due to the thermal emission being weak during our late-time follow-up observations.

The equation--Large Area Telescope and High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) confirmed, that Cen~A is a very high-energy (VHE; equation~TeV) equation-ray emitter with a known spectral softening in the energy range from a few GeV to TeV. In this work, we consider a synchrotron self-Compton model in the nucleus for the broad band spectrum below the break energy and an external Compton model in kpc-scale jets for the equation-ray excess. Our results show that the observed equation-ray excess can be suitably described by the inverse Compton scattering of the starlight photons in the kpc-scale jets, which is consistent with the recent tentative report by the HESS on the spatial extension of the TeV emission along the jets. Considering the spectral fitting results, the excess can only be seen in Cen~A, which is probably due to two factors: (1) the host galaxy is approximately 50 times more luminous than other typical radio galaxies and (2) the core equation-ray spectrum quickly decays above a few MeV due to the low maximum electron Lorentz factor of equation resulting from the large magnetic field of 3.8~G in the core.

Available color information is inconsistent with pure extinction reduction as the cause for the photometric brightening. Optical spectroscopic characteristics in the current bright phase include: little in the way of absorption except for the hallmark Li I 6707 A signature of youth plus weak e.g. Ca I and notably Ba II; strong wind/outflow in Ca II, Mg I b, Na I D, Halpha, K I, O I; jet signatures in [O I], [S II], [Ca II], [Fe II], and [Ni II]; and narrow rest-velocity emission in neutral species such as Fe I, Ni I, and Mg I. The infrared spectrum is also characterized by outflow and emission, including: a hot He I wind, jet lines such as [Fe II] and H2; and weak narrow rest-velocity atomic line emission. The 12CO bandheads are weakly in emission, but there is also broad H2O absorption. Gaia 19ajj exhibited a previous bright state in the 2010-2012 time frame.

1903.09684,astro-ph,"Galactic dust emission is polarized at unexpectedly high levels, as revealed by Planck. The origin of the observed equation polarization fractions can be identified by characterizing the properties of optical starlight polarization in a region with maximally polarized dust emission. We measure the R-band linear polarization of 22 stars in a region with a submillimeter polarization fraction of equation. A subset of 6 stars is also measured in the B, V and I bands to investigate the wavelength dependence of polarization. We find that starlight is polarized at correspondingly high levels. Through multiband polarimetry we find that the high polarization fractions are unlikely to arise from unusual dust properties, such as enhanced grain alignment. Instead, a favorable magnetic field geometry is the most likely explanation, and is supported by observational probes of the magnetic field morphology. The observed starlight polarization exceeds the classical upper limit of equation%magequation and is at least as high as 13%magequation that was inferred from a joint analysis of Planck data, starlight polarization and reddening measurements. Thus, we confirm that the intrinsic polarizing ability of dust grains at optical wavelengths has long been underestimated.",2019,[],5

1904.12261,astro-ph,"A fraction of tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) whose black holes possess accretion disks; these TDEs can be confused with common AGN flares. The disruption itself is unaffected by the disk, but the evolution of the bound debris stream is modified by its collision with the disk when it returns to pericenter. The outcome of the collision is largely determined by the ratio of the stream mass current to the azimuthal mass current of the disk rotating underneath the stream footprint, which in turn depends on the mass and luminosity of the AGN. To characterize TDEs in AGNs, we simulated a suite of stream--disk collisions with various mass current ratios. The collision excites shocks in the disk, leading to inflow and energy dissipation orders of magnitude above Eddington; however, much of the radiation is trapped in the inflow and advected into the black hole, so the actual bolometric luminosity may be closer to Eddington. The emergent spectrum may not be thermal, TDE-like, or AGN-like. The rapid inflow causes the disk interior to the impact point to be depleted within a fraction of the mass return time. If the stream is heavy enough to penetrate the disk, part of the outgoing material eventually hits the disk again, dissipating its kinetic energy in the second collision; another part becomes unbound, emitting synchrotron radiation as it shocks with surrounding gas.",2019,[],5
1904.03956,astro-ph,"The closest potentially habitable worlds outside our Solar system orbit a different kind of star than our Sun: smaller red dwarf stars. Such stars can flare frequently, bombarding their planets with biologically damaging high-energy UV radiation, placing planetary atmospheres at risk of erosion and bringing the habitability of these worlds into question. However, the surface UV flux on these worlds is unknown. Here we show the first models of the surface UV environments of the four closest potentially habitable exoplanets: Proxima-b, TRAPPIST-1e, Ross-128b, and LHS-1140b assuming different atmospheric compositions, spanning Earth-analogue to eroded and anoxic atmospheres and compare them to levels for Earth throughout its geological evolution. Even for planet models with eroded and anoxic atmospheres, surface UV radiation remains below early Earth levels, even during flares. Given that the early Earth was inhabited, we show that UV radiation should not be a limiting factor for the habitability of planets orbiting M stars. Our closest neighbouring worlds remain intriguing targets for the search for life beyond our Solar system.",2019,[],5
1904.07465,astro-ph,"Coronal heating is a big question for modern astronomy. Daily measurement of 985 solar spectral irradiances (SSIs) at the spectral intervals 1-39 nm and 116-2416 nm during March 1 2003 to October 28 2017 is utilized to investigate characteristics of solar rotation in the solar atmosphere by means of the Lomb \,-\, Scargle periodogram method to calculate their power spectra. The rotation period of coronal plasma is obtained to be 26.3 days, and that of the solar atmosphere at the bottom of the photosphere modulated by magnetic structures is 27.5 days. Here we report for the first time that unexpectedly the coronal atmosphere is found to rotate faster than the underlying photosphere. When time series of SSIs are divided into different cycles, and the ascending and descending periods of a solar cycle, rotation rate in the corona is also found to be larger than that in the photosphere, and this actually gives hidden evidence: it is small-scale magnetic activity that heats the corona.",2019,[],5
1906.03268,astro-ph,"The ultra-diffuse dwarf galaxy NGC 1052-DF2 (DF2) has ten (eleven) measured globular clusters (GCs) with a line-of-sight velocity dispersion of equationkm/s (equationkm/s). Our conventional statistical analysis of the original ten GCs gives equationkm/s. The overall distribution of velocities agrees well with a Gaussian of this width. Due to the non-linear Poisson equation in MOND, a dwarf galaxy has weaker self-gravity when in close proximity to a massive host. This external field effect is investigated using a new analytic formulation and fully self-consistent live equation-body models in MOND. Our formulation agrees well with that of Famaey and McGaugh (2012). These new simulations confirm our analytic results and suggest that DF2 may be in a deep-freeze state unique to MOND. The correctly calculated MOND velocity dispersion agrees with our inferred dispersion and that of van Dokkum et al. (2018b) if DF2 is within 150 kpc of NGC 1052 and both are 20 Mpc away. The GCs of DF2 are however significantly brighter and larger than normal GCs, a problem which disappears if DF2 is significantly closer to us. A distance of 10-13 Mpc makes DF2 a normal dwarf galaxy even more consistent with MOND and the 13 Mpc distance reported by Trujillo et. al. (2019). We discuss the similar dwarf DF4, finding good agreement with MOND. We also discuss possible massive galaxies near DF2 and DF4 along with their distances and peculiar velocities, noting that NGC 1052 may lie at a distance near 10 Mpc.",2019,[],5
1907.04932,astro-ph,"Early telescopic observations of sunspots were conducted with instruments of relatively small aperture. These instruments also suffered from a higher level of scattered light, and the human eye served as a ""detector"". The eye's ability to resolve small details depends on image contrast, and on average the intensity variations smaller than equation 3\% contrast relative to background are not detected even if they are resolved by the telescope. Here we study the effect of these three parameters (telescope aperture, scattered light, and detection threshold of human vision) on sunspot number, group number, and area of sunspots. As an ""ideal"" dataset, we employ white-light (pseudo-continuum) observations from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard of Solar Dynamics Observatory, and we model the appearance of sunspots by degrading the HMI images to corresponding telescope apertures with an added scattered light. We discuss the effects of different parameters on sunspot counts and derive functional dependencies, which could be used to normalize historical observations of sunspot counts to common denominator.",2019,[],5
1907.13448,astro-ph,"The origin of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is one of the most debated issues in astrophysics.   Here, we explore the possible link between the quasi-universal filamentary structure of star-forming molecular clouds and the origin of the IMF.   Based on our recent comprehensive study of filament properties from Herschel Gould Belt survey observations (Arzoumanian et al.), we derive, for the first time, a good estimate of the filament mass function (FMF) and filament line mass function (FLMF) in nearby molecular clouds. We use the observed FLMF to propose a simple toy model for the origin of the prestellar core mass function (CMF), relying on gravitational fragmentation of thermally supercritical but virialized filaments.   We find that the FMF and the FLMF have very similar shapes and are both consistent with a Salpeter-like power-law function (dequation/dlogequation) in the regime of thermally supercritical filaments (equation/pc). This is a remarkable result since, in contrast, the mass distribution of molecular clouds and clumps is known to be significantly shallower than the Salpeter power-law IMF, with dequation/dlogequation.   Since the vast majority of prestellar cores appear to form in thermally transcritical or supercritical filaments, we suggest that the prestellar CMF and by extension the stellar IMF are at least partly inherited from the FLMF through gravitational fragmentation of individual filaments.",2019,[],5
1909.00610,astro-ph,"Effects of inhomogeneities on observations have been vastly studied using both perturbative methods, N-body simulations and Swiss cheese solutions to the Einstein equations. In nearly all cases, such studied setups assume vanishing spatial background curvature. While a spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker model is in accordance with observations, a non-vanishing curvature is not ruled out. It is therefore important to note that, as has been pointed out in the literature, 1 dimensional averages might not converge to volume averages in non-Euclidean space. If this is indeed the case, it will affect the interpretation of observations in spacetimes with non-vanishing average spatial curvature. This possibility is therefore studied here by computing the integrated expansion rate and shear, the accumulated density contrast, and fluctuations in the redshift-distance relation in Swiss cheese models with different background curvatures. It is found that differences in mean and dispersion of these quantities in the different models are small and naturally attributable to differences in background expansion rate and density contrasts. Thus, the study does not yield an indication that the relationship between 1 dimensional spatial averages and volume averages depends significantly on background curvature.",2019,[],5
1905.08802,astro-ph,"The obscuring structure surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be explained as a dust and gas flow cycle that fundamentally connects the AGN with their host galaxies. This structure is believed to be associated with dusty winds driven by radiation pressure. However, the role of magnetic fields, which are invoked in almost all models for accretion onto a supermassive black hole and outflows, is not thoroughly studied. Here we report the first detection of polarized thermal emission by means of magnetically aligned dust grains in the dusty torus of NGC 1068 using ALMA Cycle 4 polarimetric dust continuum observations (equation, equation pc; 348.5 GHz, equation equationm). The polarized torus has an asymmetric variation across the equatorial axis with a peak polarization of equation\% and position angle of equation (B-vector) at equation pc east from the core. We compute synthetic polarimetric observations of magnetically aligned dust grains assuming a toroidal magnetic field and homogeneous grain alignment. We conclude that the measured 860 equationm continuum polarization arises from magnetically aligned dust grains in an optically thin region of the torus. The asymmetric polarization across the equatorial axis of the torus arises from 1) an inhomogeneous optical depth, and 2) a variation of the velocity dispersion, i.e. variation of the magnetic field turbulence at sub-pc scales, from the eastern to the western region of the torus. These observations and modeling constrain the torus properties beyond spectral energy distribution results. This study strongly supports that magnetic fields up to a few pc contribute to the accretion flow onto the active nuclei.",2019,[],5
1912.07604,astro-ph,"Since the onset of the `space revolution' of high-precision high-cadence photometry, asteroseismology has been demonstrated as a powerful tool for informing Galactic archaeology investigations. The launch of the NASA TESS mission has enabled seismic-based inferences to go full sky -- providing a clear advantage for large ensemble studies of the different Milky Way components. Here we demonstrate its potential for investigating the Galaxy by carrying out the first asteroseismic ensemble study of red giant stars observed by TESS. We use a sample of 25 stars for which we measure their global asteroseimic observables and estimate their fundamental stellar properties, such as radius, mass, and age. Significant improvements are seen in the uncertainties of our estimates when combining seismic observables from TESS with astrometric measurements from the Gaia mission compared to when the seismology and astrometry are applied separately. Specifically, when combined we show that stellar radii can be determined to a precision of a few percent, masses to 5-10% and ages to the 20% level. This is comparable to the precision typically obtained using end-of-mission Kepler data",2019,[],5
1904.02714,astro-ph,"Overshooting from the convective cores of stars more massive than about 1.2 M(Sun) has a profound impact on their subsequent evolution. And yet, the formulation of the overshooting mechanism in current stellar evolution models has a free parameter (f[ov] in the diffusive approximation) that remains poorly constrained by observations, affecting the determination of astrophysically important quantities such as stellar ages. In an earlier series of papers we assembled a sample of 37 well-measured detached eclipsing binaries to calibrate the dependence of f[ov] on stellar mass, showing that it increases sharply up to a mass of roughly 2 M(Sun), and remains constant thereafter out to at least 4.4 M(Sun). Recent claims have challenged the utility of eclipsing binaries for this purpose, on the basis that the uncertainties in f[ov] from the model fits are typically too large to be useful, casting doubt on a dependence of overshooting on mass. Here we reexamine those claims and show them to be too pessimistic, mainly because they did not account for all available constraints --- both observational and theoretical --- in assessing the true uncertainties. We also take the opportunity to add semi-empirical f[ov] determinations for 13 additional binaries to our previous sample, and to update the values for 9 others. All are consistent with, and strengthen our previous conclusions, supporting a dependence of f[ov] on mass that is now based on estimates for a total of 50 binary systems (100 stars).",2019,[],5
1909.04204,astro-ph,"Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide unique and important feedback in quiescent galaxies, but their impact has been underappreciated. In this paper, we analyze a series of high-resolution simulations to examine the energetics and turbulence of the medium under SNe Ia. We find that when SN remnants are resolved, their effects differ distinctly from a volumetric heating term, as is commonly assumed in unresolved simulations. First, the net heating is significantly higher than expected, by 30equation10\% per cooling time. This is because a large fraction of the medium is pushed into lower densities which cool inefficiently. Second, the medium is turbulent; the root-mean-squared (RMS) velocity of the gas to 20-50 km sequation on a driving scale of tens of parsec. The velocity field of the medium is dominated by compressional modes, which are larger than the solenoidal components by a factor of 3-7. Third, the hot gas has a very broad density distribution. The ratio between the density fluctuations and the RMS Mach number, parameterized as equation, is 2-20. This is in contrast to previous simulations of turbulent media, which have found equation 1. The reason for the difference is mainly caused by the \textitlocalized heating of SNe Ia, which creates a large density contrast. Last, the typical length scale of a density fluctuation grows with time, forming increasingly larger bubbles and filamentary ridges. These underlying density fluctuations need to be included when X-ray observations are interpreted.",2019,[],5
1901.09573,astro-ph,"During lunar eclipse of January 21, 2019 a meteoroid impacted the Moon producing a visible light flash. The impact was witnessed by casual observers offering an opportunity to study the phenomenon from multiple geographical locations. We use images and videos collected by observers in 7 countries to estimate the location, impact parameters (speed and incoming direction) and energy of the meteoroid. Using parallax, we achieve determining the impact location at lat. equation, lon. equation and geocentric distance as 356553 km. After devising and applying a photo-metric procedure for measuring flash standard magnitudes in multiple RGB images having different exposure times, we found that the flash, had an average G-magnitude equation. We use gravitational ray tracing (GRT) to estimate the orbital properties and likely radiant of the impactor. We find that the meteoroid impacted the moon with a speed of equation km/s (70% C.L.) and at a shallow angle, equation degrees. Assuming a normal error for our estimated flash brightness, educated priors for the luminous efficiency and object density, and using the GRT-computed probability distributions of impact speed and incoming directions, we calculate posterior probability distributions for the kinetic energy (median equation = 0.8 kton), body mass (equation = 27 kg) and diameter (equation = 29 cm), and crater size (equation = 9 m). If our assumptions are correct, the crater left by the impact could be detectable by prospecting lunar probes.

We compare spatial distributions of two [CI] lines with that of CO(1-0) emission, and find that both [CI] lines distribute similarly to CO(1-0) emission in most galaxies. We present luminosity ratio maps of L'[CI](1-0)/L'CO(1-0), L'[CI](2-1)/L'CO(1-0), L'[CI](2-1)/L'[CI](1-0) (hereafter R[CI]) and f70/f160. L'[CI](2-1)/L'CO(1-0), R[CI] and f70/f160 are centrally peaked in starbursts; whereas remain relatively constant in LINERs, indicating that star-forming activity can enhance carbon emission, especially for [CI](2-1). We explore the correlations between the luminosities of CO(1-0) and [CI] lines, and find that L'CO(1-0) correlates tightly and almost linearly with both L'[CI](1-0) and L'[CI](2-1), suggesting that [CI] lines, similar as CO(1-0), can trace total molecular gas in our resolved galaxies on kpc scales. We investigate the dependence of L'[CI](1-0)/L'CO(1-0), L'[CI](2-1)/L'CO(1-0) and [CI] excitation temperature Tex on dust temperature Tdust, and find non-correlation, a weak and modest correlation, respectively. The ratio of L'[CI](1-0)/L'CO(1-0) stays smooth distribution in most galaxies, indicating that the conversion factor of [CI](1-0) luminosity to H2 mass (X[CI](1-0)) changes with CO(1-0) conversion factor (\alphaCO) proportionally. Under optically thin and LTE assumptions, we derive a galaxy-wide average carbon excitation temperature Tex ~ 19.7  0.5K and an average neutral carbon abundance X[CI]/X[H2] ~2.5  1.0 * 10-5 in our resolved sample, which is comparable to the usually adopted value of 3*10-5, but ~3 times lower than the carbon abundance in local (U)LIRGs.

1911.05690,astro-ph,"We present an eccentric precessing gas disk model designed to study the variable circumstellar absorption features detected for WD 1145017, a metal polluted white dwarf with an actively disintegrating asteroid around it. This model, inspired by one recently proposed by Cauley et al., calculates explicitly the gas opacity for any predetermined physical conditions in the disk, predicting the strength and shape of all absorption features, from the UV to the optical, at any given phase of the precession cycle. The successes and failures of this simple model provide valuable insight on the physical characteristics of the gas surrounding the star, notably its composition, temperature and density. This eccentric disk model also highlights the need for supplementary components, most likely circular rings, in order to explain the presence of zero velocity absorption as well as highly ionized Si IV lines. We find that a precession period of equation yrs can successfully reproduce the shape of the velocity profile observed at most epochs from April 2015 to January 2018, although minor discrepancies at certain times indicate that the assumed geometric configuration may not be optimal yet. Finally, we show that our model can quantitatively explain the change in morphology of the circumstellar features during transiting events.",2019,[],5
1901.06582,astro-ph,"Westerlund 1 (Wd1) is potentially the largest star cluster in the Galaxy. That designation critically depends upon the distance to the cluster, yet the cluster is highly obscured, making luminosity-based distance estimates difficult. Using \it Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) parallaxes and Bayesian inference, we infer a parallax of equation mas corresponding to a distance of equation kpc. To leverage the combined statistics of all stars in the direction of Wd1, we derive the Bayesian model for a cluster of stars hidden among Galactic field stars; this model includes the parallax zero-point. Previous estimates for the distance to Wd1 ranged from 1.0 to 5.5 kpc, although values around 5 kpc have usually been adopted. The \it Gaia DR2 parallaxes reduce the uncertainty from a factor of 3 to 18\% and rules out the most often quoted value of 5 kpc with 99\% confidence. This new distance allows for more accurate mass and age determinations for the stars in Wd1. For example, the previously inferred initial mass at the main-sequence turn-off was around 40 Mequation; the new \it Gaia DR2 distance shifts this down to about 22 Mequation. This has important implications for our understanding of the late stages of stellar evolution, including the initial mass of the magnetar and the LBV in Wd1. Similarly, the new distance suggests that the total cluster mass is about four times lower than previously calculated.",2019,[],5
1904.11939,astro-ph,We employ synthetic observations obtained with MHD simulations to study how to trace the distribution of turbulent magnetic fields using the synchrotron polarization gradient techniques suggested by Lazarian \& Yuen (2018). Both synchrotron polarization gradients and its derivative gradients with regard to the squared wavelength equation are used to explore the probing ability of the technique in magnetic fields from sub- to super-Alfv\'enic turbulence. We focus on studies that involve multi-frequency measurements in the presence of strong Faraday rotation and show the ways of how to recover the projected mean magnetic fields in the plane of the sky and the local magnetic fields within a tomographic slice.

For a two-transit detection criterion, the expected mean value of the most frequently detected orbital period is 5.01 days with the most frequently detected range of 2.12 to 11.82 days in the region with observation of 27 days. Near the poles where the observational duration is 351 days, the expected mean orbital period is 10.93 days with the most frequently detected range being from 3.35 to 35.65 days. For one-transit, the most frequently detected orbital period is 8.17 days in the region with observation of 27 days and 11.25 days near the poles. For the entire TESS mission containing several sectors, we estimate that the mean value of orbital period is 8.47 days for two-transit and 10.09 days for one-transit, respectively.

Once they are formed and through their descent towards the surface, these nanoparticles are submitted to persistent Far Ultra-Violet (FUV) radiation that can reach lower atmospheric layers. Such an interaction has an impact, especially on the chemistry and charge budget of the atmospheric compounds. Models are useful to understand this photoprocessing, but they lack important input data such as the photoemission threshold or the absolute photoabsorption/emission cross sections of the aerosols. In order to quantify the photoemission processes, analogs of Titan s aerosols have been studied with the DESIRS FUV beamline at the synchrotron SOLEIL as isolated substrate-free nanoparticles.

The results show a very low photoionization threshold (6.0 /- 0.1 eV~ 207 nm) and very high absolute ionization cross sections (~106 Mb) indicating that FUV photoemission from aerosols is an intense source of slow electrons which has to be taken into account in photochemical models of Titan s atmosphere.",2019,[],5
1902.10724,astro-ph,"We extend our previous work focused at equation, studying the redshift evolution of galaxy dynamical properties using the state-of-the-art semi-analytic model GAEA: we show that the predicted size-mass relation for disky/star forming and quiescent galaxies is in good agreement with observational estimates, up to equation. Bulge dominated galaxies have sizes that are offset low with respect to observational estimates, mainly due to our implementation of disk instability at high redshift. At large masses, both quiescent and bulge dominated galaxies have sizes smaller than observed. We interpret this as a consequence of our most massive galaxies having larger gas masses than observed, and therefore being more affected by dissipation. We argue that a proper treatment of quasar driven winds is needed to alleviate this problem. Our model compact galaxies have number densities in agreement with observational estimates and they form most of their stars in small and low angular momentum high-equation halos. GAEA predicts that a significant fraction of compact galaxies forming at high-equation is bound to merge with larger structures at lower redshifts: therefore they are not the progenitors of normal-size passive galaxies at equation. Our model also predicts a stellar-halo size relation that is in good agreement with observational estimates. The ratio between stellar size and halo size is proportional to the halo spin and does not depend on stellar mass but for the most massive galaxies, where AGN feedback leads to a significant decrease of the retention factor (from about 80 per cent to 20 per cent).",2019,[],5

We found that DPs globally increase the number of JFCs by 12.6% when compared with the comets produced by the giant planets alone. When considering each population separately, we find that the increment produced by DPs is 17%, 12%, and 3% for the Classical, Resonant, and Scattering populations, respectively.

An analytic theory is proposed to measure the distance to powerful \citeauthorFR1974 type-II radio sources based on their integrated flux density across a broad range of radio frequencies, and the angular size and axis ratio of their synchrotron-emitting lobes. This technique can be used at low-redshift to construct absolute standard candles in conjunction with X-ray observations of the host cluster, or at high-redshift to measure the relative distances of objects and constrain the curvature of our universe. Distances calculated with this method are consistent for dissimilar objects at the same redshift; the two lobes of Cygnus A have flux densities, linear sizes and spectral break frequencies varying by between 15-35\% yet their fitted distances are the same to within 7\%. These distance estimates together yield a transverse comoving distance to Cygnus A of equation corresponding to a Hubble constant of equation.

Optical depth effects and contamination of equationCequationO by CequationH is discussed and accounted for to derive column densities.

Measured isotopic ratios suggest an enhancement of equationO as compared to our Galactic center, which we attribute to an extra equationO injection from massive stars. Our observations show evidence for mixing of distinct gas components with different degrees of processing. We observe an extra molecular component of highly processed gas on top of the already proposed less processed gas being transported to the central region of NGC 253.

1909.05102,astro-ph,"In this paper, I revoke a debate about an origin of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) dimming. I argue that except for a commonly accepted accelerating expansion of the Universe, a conceivable alternative for explaining this observation is universe opacity caused by light extinction by intergalactic dust, even though it is commonly assumed that this effect is negligible. Using data of the Union2.1 SN Ia compilation, I find that the standard equationCDM model and the opaque universe model fit the SN Ia measurements at redshifts equation comparably well. The optimum solution for the opaque universe model is characterized by the B-band intergalactic opacity equation and the Hubble constant equation. The intergalactic opacity is higher than that obtained from independent observations but still within acceptable limits. This result emphasizes that the issue of the accelerating expansion of the Universe as the origin of the SN Ia dimming is not yet definitely resolved.

A sudden increase of the absolute value of the mean longitudinal magnetic field and an accompanying spectral variability was detected on 2018 February 17. New FORS2 spectropolarimetric data obtained from 2018 December to 2019 February confirm the very slow magnetic field variability, with the field decreasing from about 150G to -100G over two months. Such a slow magnetic field variability, related to the extremely slow rotation of HD54879, is also confirmed using high-resolution HARPSpol and ESPaDOnS spectropolarimetry. The re-analysis of the FORS2 polarimetric spectra from 2018 February indicates that the previously reported field increase and the change of the spectral appearance was caused by improper spectra extraction and wavelength calibration using observations obtained at an insufficient signal-to-noise ratio. The presented properties of HD54879 are discussed in the context of the Of?p spectral classification.",2019,[],5
1903.06910,astro-ph,"Since very recently, we acquired knowledge on the existence of comets in extrasolar planetary systems. The formation of comets together with planets around host stars now seems evident. As stars are often born in clusters of interstellar clouds, the interaction between the systems will lead to the exchange of material at the edge of the clouds. Therefore, almost every planetary system should have leftover remnants as a result of planetary formation in form of comets at the edges of those systems. These Oort clouds around stars are often disturbed by different processes (e.g., galactic tides, passing stars, etc.), which consequently scatter bodies from the distant clouds into the system close to the host star. Regarding the Solar System, we observe this outcome in the form of cometary families. This knowledge supports the assumption of the existence of comets around other stars. In the present work, we study the orbital dynamics of hypothetical exocomets, based on detailed computer simulations, in three star-planet systems, which are: HD~10180, 47~UMa, and HD~141399. These systems host one or more Jupiter-like planets, which change the orbits of the incoming comets in characteristic ways.",2019,[],5
1907.13425,astro-ph,"Context: Recently, the He I triplet at 10830 \rA has been rediscovered as an excellent probe of the extended and possibly evaporating atmospheres of close-in transiting planets. This has already resulted in detections of this triplet in the atmospheres of a handful of planets, both from space and from the ground. However, while a strong signal is expected for the hot Jupiter HD 209458 b, only upper limits have been obtained so far. Aims: Our goal is to measure the helium excess absorption from HD 209458 b and assess the extended atmosphere of the planet and possible evaporation. Methods: We obtained new high-resolution spectral transit time-series of HD 209458 b using CARMENES at the 3.5 m Calar Alto telescope, targeting the He I triplet at 10830 \rA at a spectral resolving power of 80 400. The observed spectra were corrected for stellar absorption lines using out of transit data, for telluric absorption using the molecfit software, and for the sky emission lines using simultaneous sky measurements through a second fibre. Results: We detect He I absorption at a level of 0.91 equation 0.10 % (9 equation) at mid-transit. The absorption follows the radial velocity change of the planet during transit, unambiguously identifying the planet as the source of the absorption. The core of the absorption exhibits a net blueshift of 1.8 equation 1.3 km sequation. Possible low-level excess absorption is seen further blueward from the main absorption near the centre of the transit, which could be caused by an extended tail. However, this needs to be confirmed. Conclusions: Our results further support a close relationship between the strength of planetary absorption in the helium triplet lines and the level of ionising, stellar X-ray and extreme-UV irradiation.",2019,[],5

Based on a prototype originally developed by Waszczak et al. (2017) for the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), the predecessor of ZTF, ZStreak features an improved machine-learning model that can cope with the equation data rate increment between PTF and ZTF. Since its first discovery on 2018 February 5 (2018 CL), ZTF/ZStreak has discovered equation confirmed new NEAs over a total of 232 observable nights until 2018 December 31. Most of the discoveries are small NEAs, with diameters less than equation m.

We will further improve real-time follow-up capabilities, and work on suppressing false positives using deep learning.",2019,[],5
1907.08342,astro-ph,"We study the luminosity function and formation rate of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) by using a maximum likelihood method. This is the first time this method is applied to a well-defined sample of GRBs that is complete in redshift. The sample is composed of 99 bursts detected by the equation satellite, 81 of them with measured redshift and luminosity for a completeness level of equation. We confirm that a strong redshift evolution in luminosity (with an evolution index of equation) or in density (equation) is needed in order to reproduce the observations well. But since the predicted redshift and luminosity distributions in the two scenarios are very similar, it is difficult to distinguish between these two kinds of evolutions only on the basis of the current sample. Furthermore, we also consider an empirical density case in which the GRB rate density is directly described as a broken power-law function and the luminosity function is taken to be non-evolving. In this case, we find that the GRB formation rate rises like equation for equation and is proportional to equation for equation. The local GRB rate is equation Gpcequation yrequation. The GRB rate may be consistent with the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) at equation, but shows an enhancement compared to the SFR at equation.",2019,[],5
1908.05132,astro-ph,"Numerous apparent signatures of magnetic reconnection have been reported in the solar photosphere, including inverted-Y shaped jets. The reconnection at these sites is expected to cause localised bi-directional flows and extended shock waves; however, these signatures are rarely observed as extremely high spatial-resolution data are required. Here, we use H-alpha imaging data sampled by the Swedish Solar Telescope's CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter to investigate whether bi-directional flows can be detected within inverted-Y shaped jets near the solar limb. These jets are apparent in the H-alpha line wings, while no signature of either jet is observed in the H-alpha line core, implying reconnection took place below the chromospheric canopy. Asymmetries in the H-alpha line profiles along the legs of the jets indicate the presence of bi-directional flows, consistent with cartoon models of reconnection in chromospheric anemone jets. These asymmetries are present for over two minutes, longer than the lifetimes of Rapid Blue Excursions, and beyond  1 \AA\ into the wings of the line indicating that flows within the inverted-Y shaped jets are responsible for the imbalance in the profiles, rather than motions in the foreground. Additionally, surges form following the occurrence of the inverted-Y shaped jets. This surge formation is consistent with models which suggest such events could be caused by the propagation of shock waves from reconnection sites in the photosphere to the upper atmosphere. Overall, our results provide evidence that magnetic reconnection in the photosphere can cause bi-directional flows within inverted-Y shaped jets and could be the driver of surges.",2019,[],5
1909.12332,astro-ph,"The supersonic winds produced by massive stars carry a large amount of kinetic power. In numerous scenarios such winds have been proven to produce shocks in which relativistic particles are accelerated emitting non-thermal radiation. Here, we report the first detection of non-thermal emission from a single stellar bubble, G2.41.4, associated with a WO star. We observed this source with the uGMRT in Band 4 (equation MHz) and Band 5 (equation MHz). We present intensity and spectral index maps for this source that are consistent with synchrotron emission (average spectral index, equation). The fraction of the available kinetic wind power that is converted into cosmic ray acceleration is estimated to be of the order of a few per cent. This finding constitutes an observational breakthrough and gives new insight on the non-thermal physical processes taking place in the environments of isolated massive stars. In particular, our results show that non-runaway isolated massive stars are capable of accelerating relativistic particles and are therefore confirmed as sources of Galactic cosmic rays.",2019,[],5
1905.10183,astro-ph,"By adopting empirical estimates of the Helium enhancement (Delta Y) between consecutive stellar generations for a sample of Galactic globular clusters (GGC), we uniquely constraint the star formation efficiency of each stellar generation in these stellar systems. In our approach, the star formation efficiency is the central factor that links stellar generations as it defines both their stellar mass and the remaining mass available for further star formation, fixing also the amount of matter required to contaminate the next stellar generation. In this way, the star formation efficiency is here shown to be fully defined by the He enhancement between successive stellar generations in a GC.   Our approach has also an impact on the evolution of clusters and thus considers the possible loss of stars through evaporation, tidal interactions and stellar evolution. We focus on the present mass ratio between consecutive stellar generations and the present total mass of Galactic globular clusters. Such considerations suffice to determine the relative proportion of stars of consecutive generations that remain today in globular clusters. The latter is also shown to directly depend on the values of Delta Y and thus the He enhancement between consecutive stellar generations in GGC places major constraints on models of star formation and evolution of GC.",2019,[],5
1910.08722,astro-ph,"We present the results of a dust-reverberation survey of quasars at redshifts z<0.6. We found a delayed response of the K-band flux variation after the optical flux variation in 25 out of 31 targets, and obtained the lag time between them for 22 targets. Combined with the results for nearby Seyfert galaxies, we provide the largest homogeneous collection of K-band dust-reverberation data for 36 type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs). This doubles the sample and includes the most distant AGN and the largest lag so far measured. We estimated the optical luminosity of the AGN component of each target using three different methods: spectral decomposition, the flux-variation-gradient method, and image decomposition. We found a strong correlation between the reverberation radius for the innermost dust torus and the optical luminosity over a range of approximately four orders of magnitude in luminosity, as is already known for Seyfert galaxies. We estimated the luminosity distances of the AGNs based on their dust-reverberation lags, and found that the data in the redshift-distance diagram are consistent with the current standard estimates of the cosmological parameters. We also present the radius-luminosity relations for isotropic luminosity indicators such as the hard X-ray (14--195 keV), [OIV] 25.89 um, and mid-infrared (12 um) continuum luminosities, which are applicable to obscured AGNs.",2019,[],5
1906.04878,astro-ph,"We present new results on how the presence of stellar companions affects disk evolution based on a study of the 5-11 Myr old Upper Scorpius OB Association. Of the 50 G0-M3 Upper Sco members with disks in our sample, only seven host a stellar companion within 2"" and brighter than K = 15, compared to 35 of 75 members without disks. This matches a trend seen in the 1-2 Myr old Taurus region, where systems with a stellar companion within 40 au have a lower fraction of infrared-identified disks than those without such companions, indicating shorter disk lifetimes in close multiple systems. However, the fractions of disk systems with a stellar companion within 40 au match in Upper Sco and Taurus. Additionally, we see no difference in the millimeter brightnesses of disks in Upper Sco systems with and without companions, in contrast to Taurus where systems with a companion within 300 au are significantly fainter than wider and single systems. These results suggest that the effects of stellar companions on disk lifetimes occur within the first 1-2 Myr of disk evolution, after which companions play little further role. By contrast, disks around single stars lose the millimeter-sized dust grains in their outer regions between ages of 1-2 Myr and 5-11 Myr. The end result of small dust disk sizes and faint millimeter luminosities is the same whether the disk has been truncated by a companion or has evolved through internal processes.",2019,[],5

UFKWs are eastward propagating, have a 2-3 sol period with sufficiently long vertical wavelengths to propagate into the thermosphere, and are predicted by classical wave theory to be equatorially trapped. These prior measurements characterized UFKWs at two relatively narrow altitude bands, with one measurement altitude near 80 km and a second near 150 km. Thermospheric density profiles from solar occultation (SO) measurements made by the Extreme Ultraviolet Monitor (EUVM) onboard MAVEN [2] provide a means to characterize multi-sol period waves, including UFKWs, as a function of altitude.

1907.00688,astro-ph,"Rapidly rotating stars have been recently recognized as having a major role in the interpretation of colour-magnitude diagrams of young and intermediate-age star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds and in the Milky Way. In this work, we evaluate the distinctive spectra and distributions in colour-colour space that follow from the presence of a substantial range in effective temperatures across the surface of fast rotators. The calculations are inserted in a formalism similar to the one usually adopted for non-rotating stars, which allows us to derive tables of bolometric corrections as a function not only of a reference effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity, but also of the rotational speed with respect to the break-up value, equation, and the inclination angle, equation. We find that only very fast rotators (equation) observed nearly equator-on (equation) present sizable deviations from the colour-colour relations of non-rotating stars. In light of these results, we discuss the photometry of the equation 200-Myr-old cluster NGC 1866 and its split main sequence, which has been attributed to the simultaneous presence of slow and fast rotators. The small dispersion of its stars in colour-colour diagrams allow us to conclude that fast rotators in this cluster either have rotational velocities equation, or are all observed nearly pole-on. Such geometric colour-colour effects, although small, might be potentially detectable in the huge, high-quality photometric samples in the post-Gaia era, in addition to the evolutionary effects caused by rotation-induced mixing.",2019,[],5
1910.01656,astro-ph,"We characterize the luminosity distribution, halo mass dependence, and redshift evolution of red galaxies in galaxy clusters using the SDSS Data Release 8 RedMaPPer cluster sample.

Using a larger galaxy cluster sample than previously employed in the literature, we find that the luminosities of central galaxies scale as equation, with equation, and that the scatter of the central--galaxy luminosity at fixed equation ( equation) is equation dex, with the error bar including systematics due to miscentering of the cluster finder, photometry, and photometric redshift estimation. Our data prefers a positive correlation between the luminosity of central galaxies and the observed richness of clusters at a fixed halo mass, with an effective correlation coefficient equation. The characteristic luminosity of satellites becomes dimmer from equation to equation by equation after accounting for passive evolution. We estimate the fraction of galaxy clusters where the brightest galaxy is not the central to be equation.

1903.01318,astro-ph,"The relatively nearby spiral galaxy NGC~6946 is one of the most actively star forming galaxies in the local Universe. Ten supernovae (SNe) have been observed since 1917, and hence NGC6946 surely contains a large number of supernova remnants (SNRs). Here we report a new optical search for these SNRs using narrow-band images obtained with the WIYN telescope. We identify 147 emission nebulae as likely SNRs, based on elevated [SII]:Halpha ratios compared to HII regions. We have obtained spectra of 102 of these nebulae with Gemini North-GMOS; of these, 89 have [SII]:Halpha ratios greater than 0.4, the canonical optical criterion for identifying SNRs. There is very little overlap between our sample and the SNR candidates identified by Lacey et al. (2001) from radio data. Also, very few of our SNR candidates are known X-ray sources, unlike the situation in some other galaxies such as M33 and M83. The emission line ratios, e.g., [NII]:Halpha, of the candidates in NGC6946 are typical of those observed in SNR samples from other galaxies with comparable metallicity. None of the candidates observed in our low-resolution spectra show evidence of anomalous abundances or significant velocity broadening. A search for emission at the sites of all the historical SNe in NGC6946 resulted in detections for only two: SN1980K and SN2004et.

Regression analysis on the two samples produces consistent posterior scaling parameters, from which we derive a combined constraint on the residual scatter, equation. Joined with constraints for equation scaling with halo mass from the Weighing the Giants program and richness--temperature covariance estimates from the LoCuSS sample, we derive the richness-conditioned scatter in mass, equation, at an optical richness of approximately 70.

We mainly focus on gravitationally interacting target halos with mass of equation, and their neighbors are counted only when the mass ratio is 1:3equation3:1 and the distance is less than the sum of the virial radii of target and neighbor. The neighbors are divided into the flyby or merger samples if the pair's total energy is greater or smaller, respectively, than the capture criterion with consideration of dynamical friction. The main results are as follows: (a) The flyby fraction increases by up to a factor of 50 with decreasing halo mass and by up to a factor of 400 with increasing large-scale density, while the merger fraction does not show any significant dependencies on these two parameters; (b) The redshift evolution of the flyby fraction is twofold, increasing with redshift at equation and remaining constant at equation, while the merger fraction increases monotonically with redshift at equation; (c) The multiple interactions with two or more neighbors are on average flyby-dominated, and their fraction has a mass and environment dependence similar to that for the flyby fraction; (d) Given that flybys substantially outnumber mergers toward equation (by a factor of five) and the multiple interactions are flyby-dominated, the flyby's contribution to galactic evolution is stronger than ever at the present epoch, especially for less massive halos and in the higher density environment.

At cosmic ray ionization rates equation sequation and at moderate shock speeds, the H/Hequation ratio at the shock front is mainly determined by the cosmic ray ionization rate.

In a recent note Li et al.

1902.07939,astro-ph,"The mergers of black hole (BH)--neutron star (NS) binaries have been one of the most interesting topics in astrophysics, because such events have been thought to possibly produce multimessenger signals including gravitational waves and broadband electromagnetic (EM) waves. In this paper, we investigate EM emission from the inspiral of a binary composed of a spinning BH and a magnetized NS. Observationally, the BH is usually more massive than equation and the NS has a mass equation. During the inspiral of such a binary, the BH will accumulate more and more charges based on the charging scenario of Wald, even though the BH will eventually swallow the NS whole inevitably. We calculate the emission luminosities and energies through three energy dissipation mechanisms: magnetic dipole radiation, electric dipole radiation, and magnetic reconnection. We show that magnetic dipole radiation due to the spin of the increasingly charged BH and magnetic reconnection in between the BH and the NS could be most significant at the final inspiral stage. We find that if the BH is rapidly rotating and the NS is strongly magnetized, these mechanisms would lead to a detectable EM signal (e.g., a short-duration X-ray transient).",2019,[],5

If they are emitted by jets with constant Lorentz factors, that softness implies deposition of large amounts of energy at large distances from the centre. We show here that such soft spectra can be explained without that energetic requirement by emission of jets with the Doppler factor increasing with the distance. This can happen for either jet acceleration or deceleration, depending on the jet viewing angle.

Thanks to the previously determined mass and distance constraints of the neutron star PSR~J1909--3744, and its predominantly thermal emission, deep observations of this object with future X-ray facilities should provide useful constraints on the neutron star equation of state.",2019,[],5
1902.08190,astro-ph,"The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) will look at solar flares across the hard X-ray window provided by the Solar Orbiter cluster. Similarly to the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI), STIX is a visibility-based imaging instrument, which will ask for Fourier-based image reconstruction methods. However, in this paper we show that, as for RHESSI, also for STIX count-based imaging is possible. Specifically, here we introduce and illustrate a mathematical model that mimics the STIX data formation process as a projection from the incoming photon flux into a vector made of 120 count components. Then we test the reliability of Expectation Maximization for image reconstruction in the case of several simulated configurations typical of flare morphology.",2019,[],5
1904.00119,astro-ph,"This paper reports a design study for a space-based decametric wavelength telescope. While not a new concept, this design study focused on many of the operational aspects that would be required for an actual mission. This design optimized the number of spacecraft to insure good visibility of approx. 80% of the radio galaxies -- the primary science target for the mission. A 5,000 km lunar orbit was selected to guarantee minimal gravitational perturbations from Earth and lower radio interference. Optimal schemes for data downlink, spacecraft ranging, and power consumption were identified. An optimal mission duration of 1 year was chosen based on science goals, payload complexity, and other factors. Finally, preliminary simulations showing image reconstruction were conducted to confirm viability of the mission. This work is intended to show the viability and science benefits of conducting multi-spacecraft networked radio astronomy missions in the next few years.",2019,[],5
1903.05034,astro-ph,"We present thermal infrared observations of the active asteroid (and Geminid meteoroid stream parent) 3200 Phaethon using the Very Large Telescope. The images, at 10.7 micron wavelength, were taken with Phaethon at its closest approach to Earth (separation 0.07 AU) in 2017 December, at a linear resolution of about 14 km. We probe the Hill sphere (of radius 66 km) for trapped dust and macroscopic bodies, finding neither, and we set limits to the presence of unbound dust. The derived limits to the optical depth of dust near Phaethon depend somewhat on the assumed geometry, but are of order 1e-5. The upper limit to the rate of loss of mass in dust is 14 kg/s. This is about 50 times smaller than the rate needed to sustain the Geminid meteoroid stream in steady state. The observations thus show that the production of the Geminids does not proceed in steady state.",2019,[],5
1912.02824,astro-ph,"We investigate the cosmic evolution of the ratio between black hole mass (MBH) and host galaxy total stellar mass (Mstellar) out to z~2.5 for a sample of 100 X-ray-selected moderate-luminosity, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the Chandra-COSMOS Legacy Survey. By taking advantage of the deep multi-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy in the COSMOS field, we measure in a uniform way the galaxy total stellar mass using a SED decomposition technique and the black hole mass based on broad emission line measurements and single-epoch virial estimates. Our sample of AGN host galaxies has total stellar masses of 1010-12Msun, and black hole masses of 107.0-9.5Msun. Combining our sample with the relatively bright AGN samples from the literature, we find no significant evolution of the MBH-Mstellar relation with black hole-to-host total stellar mass ratio of MBH/Mstellar~0.3% at all redshifts probed. We conclude that the average black hole-to-host stellar mass ratio appears to be consistent with the local value within the uncertainties, suggesting a lack of evolution of the MBH-Mstellar relation up to z~2.5.",2019,[],5
1911.05025,astro-ph,"MASCARA-4 b is a hot Jupiter in a highly-misaligned orbit around a rapidly-rotating A3V star that was observed for 54 days by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (\tess). We perform two analyses of MASCARA-4 b using a stellar gravity-darkened model. First, we measure MASCARA-4 b's misaligned orbital configuration by modeling its \tess~photometric light curve. We take advantage of the asymmetry in MASCARA-4 b's transit due to its host star's gravity-darkened surface to measure MASCARA-4 b's true spin-orbit angle to be equation. We also detect a equation secondary eclipse at equation orbital phase, proving that the orbit is slightly eccentric. Second, we model MASCARA-4 b's insolation including gravity-darkening and find that the planet's received XUV flux varies by equation\% throughout its orbit. MASCARA-4 b's short-period, polar orbit suggests that the planet likely underwent dramatic orbital evolution to end up in its present-day configuration and that it receives a varying stellar irradiance that perpetually forces the planet out of thermal equilibrium. These findings make MASCARA-4 b an excellent target for follow-up characterization to better understand orbital evolution and current-day of planets around high-mass stars.",2019,[],5
1912.04589,astro-ph,"Blue Stragglers are stars located in an unexpected region of the color-magnitude diagram of a stellar population, as they appear bluer and more luminous than the stars in the turnoff region. They are ubiquitous, since they have been found among Milky Way field stars, in open and globular clusters, and also in other galaxies of the Local Group. Here we present a study on the blue straggler population of the old and metal-rich open cluster Collinder 261, based on Gaia DR2 data and on a multi-epoch radial velocity survey conducted with FLAMES@VLT. We also analyze the radial distribution of the blue straggler population to probe the dynamical status of the cluster. Blue straggler candidates were identified first with Gaia DR2, according to their position on the CMD, proper motions, and parallaxes. Their radial distribution was compared with those of the main sequence, red giant, and red clump stars, to evaluate mass segregation. Additionally, their radial velocities (and the associated uncertainties) were compared with the mean radial velocity and the velocity dispersion of the cluster. When possible, close binaries and long-period binaries were also identified, based on the radial velocity variations for the different epochs. We also looked for yellow stragglers, i.e., possible evolved blue stragglers. We found 53 blue stragglers members of Collinder 261, six of them already identified in previous catalogs. Among the blue straggler candidates with radial velocity measurements, we found one long-period binary, five close-binary systems, three non-variable stars; we also identified one yellow straggler.",2019,[],5

1911.10585,astro-ph,"In this work, we investigate the properties of young giant planet spectra in the optical and suggest that future space-based direct imaging missions should be considering young planets as a valuable and informative science case. While young planets are dimmer in the optical than in the infrared, they can still be brighter in the optical than a mature planet of similar mass. Therefore, an instrument designed to characterize mature planets should also be suitable for high-precision photometric imaging and spectroscopy of young self-luminous planets in a wavelength range and at a contrast ratio not attainable from the ground. We identify known young self-luminous companions which are feasible targets for WFIRST-CGI and compute spectra for them, including a treatment of scattering and reflected light at optical wavelengths. Using these results, we highlight potentially diagnostic spectral features that will be present in the WFIRST-CGI wavelengths. Expanding to direct imaging missions beyond WFIRST-CGI, we also use evolutionary models across a grid of masses and planet-star separations as inputs to compute spectra of hypothetical objects, exploring when reflected light may contribute to a degree comparable to that of thermal emission from the residual heat of formation.",2019,[],5
1910.11879,astro-ph,"The Cosmic Web is a complex network of filaments, walls and voids that represent the largest structures in the Universe. In this network, which is the direct result of structure formation, galaxy clusters occupy central positions as the nodes, connected through the filaments. In this work, we investigate the position in the Cosmic Web of one of the most known and best studied clusters of galaxies, the Coma cluster. We make use of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) Main Galaxy Sample and of the Discrete Persistent Structure Extractor (DisPerSE) to detect large scale filaments around the Coma cluster and we analyze the properties of the Cosmic Web. We study the network of filaments around Coma in a 75 Mpc radius region. We find that the Coma cluster has a median connectivity of 2.5, in agreement with measurements from clusters of similar mass in the literature, as well as with what expected from numerical simulations. It is indeed connected to 3 secure filaments which connect Coma to Abell 1367 and to several other clusters in the field. The location of these filaments in the vicinity of Coma is consistent with features detected in the X-ray, as well as the likely direction of infall of galaxies, as for example NGC 4839. The overall picture that emerges of the Coma cluster is that of a highly connected structure occupying a central position as a dense node of the Cosmic Web. We also find a tentative detection, at 2.1equation significance, of the filaments in the SZ signal.",2019,[],5
1909.10392,astro-ph,"The mechanism for jet formation in the disks of T Tauri stars is poorly understood. Observational benchmarks to launching models can be provided by tracing the physical properties of the kinematic components of the wind and jet in the inner 100 au of the disk surface. In the framework of the GHOsT (GIARPS High-resolution Observations of T Tauri stars) project, we aim to perform a multi-line analysis of the velocity components of the gas in the jet acceleration zone. We analyzed the GIARPS-TNG spectra of six objects in the Taurus-Auriga complex (RY Tau, DG Tau, DL Tau, HN Tau, DO Tau, RW Aur A). Thanks to the combined high-spectral resolution (R=50000-115000) and wide spectral coverage (~400-2400 nm) we observed several O, S, N, N, and Fe forbidden lines spanning a large range of excitation and ionization conditions. In four objects (DG Tau, HN Tau, DO Tau, RW Aur A), temperature (Te), electron and total density (ne, nH), and fractional ionization (xe) were derived as a function of velocity through an excitation and ionization model. The abundance of gaseous iron, X(Fe), a probe of the dust content in the jet, was derived in selected velocity channels. The physical parameters vary smoothly with velocity, suggesting a common origin for the different kinematic components. In DG Tau and HN Tau, Te, xe, and X(Fe) increase with velocity (roughly from 6000 K, 0.05, 10% X(Fe)sun to 15000 K, 0.6, 90% X(Fe)sun). This trend is in agreement with disk-wind models in which the jet is launched from regions of the disk at different radii. In DO Tau and RW Aur A, we infer xe < 0.1, nH ~106-7 cm-3, and X(Fe) <~ X(Fe)sun at all velocities. These findings are tentatively explained by the formation of these jets from dense regions inside the inner, gaseous disk, or as a consequence of their high degree of collimation.",2019,[],5
1908.05637,astro-ph,"Recent results from IceCube regarding TXS 0506056 suggest that it may be useful to test the hypothesis of multiple neutrino flares, where each flare is not necessarily accompanied by a corresponding gamma-ray flare. An untriggered, time-dependent, source-stacking search would be optimal for testing this hypothesis, however such an analysis has yet to be applied to the full duration of IceCube data. Here, we discuss one possible way of constructing such an analysis, with a global test statistic obtained by summing the individual test statistics associated with each signal-like flare in the sample. This has the additional advantage of assessing the time structure of each source when running the analysis over a source catalog. We show that, for a signal consisting of many small flares, this style of analysis represents a significant increase in discovery potential over both the existing single-flare fit and the time-integrated stacking methods. Potential source catalogs are examined in combination with this method, including the possibility of a ""self-triggered"" catalog consisting of the locations of the highest energy northern sky events in the IceCube sample.",2019,[],5
1908.11429,astro-ph,"At wavelengths longwards of the sensitivity of silicon, hybrid structured mercury-cadmium-telluride (HgCdTe) detectors show promise to enable extremely precise radial velocity (RV) measurements of late-type stars.

While the quantum efficiency of such devices has been shown to be approx ninety percent, the noise characteristics of these devices, and how they relate to RV measurements, have yet to be quantified. We characterize the various noise sources generated by H4RG arrays using numerical simulations. We present recent results using our end-to-end spectrograph simulator in combination with the HxRG Noise Generator, which emulates the effects of read noise, parameterized by white noise, correlated and uncorrelated pink noise, alternating column noise, and picture frame noise.

1912.09133,astro-ph,"We report the results of the STRong lensing Insights from the Dark Energy Survey (STRIDES) follow-up campaign of the late 2017/early 2018 season. We obtained spectra of 65 lensed quasar candidates either with EFOSC2 on the NTT or ESI on Keck, which confirm 10 new gravitationally lensed quasars and 10 quasar pairs with similar spectra, but which do not show a lensing galaxy in DES images. Eight lensed quasars are doubly imaged with source redshifts between 0.99 and 2.90, one is triply imaged by a group (DESJ0345-2545, equation), and one is quadruply imaged (quad: DESJ0053-2012, equation). Singular isothermal ellipsoid models for the doubles, based on high-resolution imaging from SAMI on SOAR or NIRC2 on Keck, give total magnifications between 3.2 and 5.6, and Einstein radii between 0.49 and 1.97 arcseconds. After spectroscopic follow-up, we extract multi-epoch equation photometry of confirmed lensed quasars and contaminant quasarstar pairs from the first 4 years of DES data using parametric multi-band modelling, and compare variability in each system's components. By measuring the reduced equation associated with fitting all epochs to the same magnitude, we find a simple cut on the less variable component that retains all confirmed lensed quasars, while removing 94 per cent of contaminant systems with stellar components. Based on our spectroscopic follow-up, this variability information can improve selection of lensed quasars and quasar pairs from 34-45 per cent to 51-70 per cent, with the majority of remaining contaminants being compact star-forming galaxies. Using mock lensed quasar lightcurves we demonstrate that selection based only on variability will over-represent the quad fraction by 10 per cent over a complete DES magnitude-limited sample (excluding microlensing differences), explained by the magnification bias and hence lower luminosity (more variable) sources in quads.",2019,[],5
1903.08777,astro-ph,"The gaseous mass of protoplanetary disks is a fundamental quantity in planet formation. The presence of gas is necessary to assemble planetesimals, it determines timescales of giant planet birth, and it is an unknown factor for a wide range of properties of planet formation, from chemical abundances (X/H) to the mass efficiency of planet formation. The gas mass obtained from traditional tracers, such as dust thermal continuum and CO isotopologues, are now known to have significant (1 - 2 orders of magnitude) discrepancies. Emission from the isotopologue of H2, hydrogen deuteride (HD), offers an alternative measurement of the disk gas mass.   Of all of the regions of the spectrum, the far-infrared stands out in that orders of magnitude gains in sensitivity can be gleaned by cooling a large aperture telescope to 8 K. Such a facility can open up a vast new area of the spectrum to exploration. One of the primary benefits of this far-infrared revolution would be the ability to survey hundreds of planet-forming disks in HD emission to derive their gaseous masses. For the first time, we will have statistics on the gas mass as a function of evolution, tracing birth to dispersal as a function of stellar spectral type. These measurements have broad implications for our understanding of the time scale during which gas is available to form giant planets, the dynamical evolution of the seeds of terrestrial worlds, and the resulting chemical composition of pre-planetary embryos carrying the elements needed for life.

1909.06385,astro-ph,"Natal kicks are matter of debate and significantly affect the merger rate density of compact objects. Here, we present a new simple formalism for natal kicks of neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). We describe the magnitude of the kick as equation, where equation is a normalization factor, drawn from a Maxwellian distribution with one-dimensional root-mean-square velocity equation~km~sequation, equation is the mass of the supernova (SN) ejecta and equation is the mass of the compact object. This formalism matches the proper motions of young Galactic pulsars and can naturally account for the differences between core-collapse SNe of single stars, electron-capture SNe and ultra-stripped SNe occurring in interacting binaries. Finally, we use our new kick formalism to estimate the local merger rate density of binary NSs (equation), BH--NS binaries (equation) and binary BHs (equation), based on the cosmic star formation rate density and metallicity evolution. In our fiducial model, we find equation~Gpcequation~yrequation, equation~Gpcequation~yrequation and equation~Gpcequation~yrequation, fairly consistent with the numbers inferred from the LIGO-Virgo collaboration.",2019,[],5
1908.07708,astro-ph,"We report a first clear detection of the Zeeman splitting of a CCS emission line at 45 GHz toward a nearby prestellar dense filament, Taurus Molecular Cloud-1.

Thus, we conclude that our detection of the CCS Zeeman splitting is robust. The derived \textcolorblackline-of-sight magnetic field strength is about 117 equation 21 equationG, which corresponds to the normalized mass-to-magnetic flux ratio of 2.2 if we adopt the inclination angle of 45equation.

Recent radiative transfer calculations of CCS and HCequationN lines along the line of sight suggest that the filament is collapsing with a speed of equation 0.6 km sequation, which is comparable to three times the isothermal sound speed.

We aim to characterize the dust, H2O and CO2 gas spatial distribution in the inner coma. To do this we performed a quantitative analysis of the release of dust and gas and compared the observed H2O production rate with the one calculated using a thermo-physical model. For this study we selected OSIRIS WAC images at 612 nm (dust) and VIRTIS-M image cubes at 612 nm, 2700 nm (H2O) and 4200 nm (CO2). We measured the average signal in a circular annulus, to study spatial variation around the comet, and in a sector of the annulus, to study temporal variation in the sunward direction with comet rotation, both at a fixed distance of 3.1 km from the comet centre. The spatial correlation between dust and water, both coming from the sun-lit side of the comet, shows that water is the main driver of dust activity in this time period. The spatial distribution of CO2 is not correlated with water and dust. There is no strong temporal correlation between the dust brightness and water production rate as the comet rotates. The dust brightness shows a peak at 0deg sub-solar longitude, which is not pronounced in the water production. At the same epoch, there is also a maximum in CO2 production. An excess of measured water production, with respect to the value calculated using a simple thermo-physical model, is observed when the head lobe and regions of the Southern hemisphere with strong seasonal variations are illuminated. A drastic decrease in dust production, when the water production (both measured and from the model) displays a maximum, happens when typical Northern consolidated regions are illuminated and the Southern hemisphere regions with strong seasonal variations are instead in shadow.",2019,[],5
1904.08526,astro-ph,"The quasi-thermal components found in many Fermi gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) imply that the photosphere emission indeed contributes to the prompt emission of many GRBs. But whether the observed spectra empirically fitted by the Band function or cutoff power law, especially the spectral and peak energy (equation) evolutions can be explained by the photosphere emission model alone needs further discussion. In this work, we investigate in detail the time-resolved spectra and equation evolutions of photospheric emission from a structured jet, with an inner-constant and outer-decreasing angular Lorentz factor profile. Also, a continuous wind with a time-dependent wind luminosity has been considered. We show that the photosphere spectrum near the peak luminosity is similar to the cutoff power-law spectrum. The spectrum can have the observed average low-energy spectral index equation equation, and the distribution of the low-energy spectral index in our photosphere model is similar to that observed (equation equation). Furthermore, the two kinds of spectral evolutions during the decay phase, separated by the width of the core (equation), are consistent with the time-resolved spectral analysis results of several Fermi multi-pulse GRBs and single-pulse GRBs, respectively. Also, for this photosphere model we can reproduce the two kinds of observed equation evolution patterns rather well.

We simultaneously fit for both AGN and galaxy LFs using a combination of Schechter or Double Power Law (DPL) functions alongside a single power law for the faint-end slope of the AGN LF. We find a lack of evolution in the shape of the bright-end of the LBG component when compared to other studies at equation and evolutionary recipes for the UV LF. Regardless of whether the LBG LF is fit with a Schechter function or DPL, AGN are found to dominate at equation. We measure a steep faint-end slope of the AGN LF with equation (equation) when fit alongside a Schechter function (DPL) for the galaxies. Our results suggest that if AGN are morphologically selected it results in a bias to lower number densities. Only by considering the full galaxy population over the transition region from AGN to LBG domination can an accurate measurement of the total LF be attained.",2019,[],5
1911.10740,astro-ph,"We present the pilot study component of the Fluorescent Lyman-Alpha Structures in High-z Environments (FLASHES) Survey; the largest integral-field spectroscopy survey to date of the circumgalactic medium at equation. We observed 48 quasar fields between 2015 and 2018 with the Palomar Cosmic Web Imager (Matuszewski et al. 2010). Extended HI Lyman-equation emission is discovered around 42/48 of the observed quasars, ranging in projected, flux-weighted radius from 21-71 proper kiloparsecs (pkpc), with 26 nebulae exceeding equation in effective diameter. The circularly averaged surface brightness radial profile peaks at a maximum of equation (equation adjusted for cosmological dimming) and luminosities range from equation to equation. The emission appears to have a highly eccentric morphology and a maximum covering factor of equation (equation for giant nebulae). On average, the nebular spectra are red-shifted with respect to both the systemic redshift and Lyequation peak of the quasar spectrum. The integrated spectra of the nebulae mostly have single or double-peaked line shapes with global dispersions ranging from equation to equation, though the individual (Gaussian) components of lines with complex shapes mostly appear to have dispersions equation equation, and the flux-weighted velocity centroids of the lines vary by thousands of equation with respect to the systemic QSO redshifts. Finally, the root-mean-square velocities of the nebulae are found to be consistent with gravitational motions expected in dark matter halos of mass equation.

1911.11826,astro-ph,"Point Sources (PS) are one of the main contaminants to the recovery of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) signal at small scales, and their careful detection will be important for the next generation of CMB experiments like CORE. We want to develop a method based on Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) to detect PS in realistic simulations, the Point Source Image Detection Network (PoSeIDoN), and compare its performance against one of the most used PS detection method in this context, the Mexican Hat wavelet 2 (MHW2). The frequencies for our analysis are the 143, 217 and 353 GHz Planck channels. We produce PS realistic simulations at each frequency including possible contaminating signals as CMB, Cosmic Infrared Background, Galactic thermal emission and instrumental noise. We first produce a set of training simulations at 217 GHz. Then we apply both the trained FCN and the MHW2 to recover the PS in the validating simulations at all the frequencies, comparing the results by estimating the reliability, completeness and flux density estimation accuracy. In the extragalactic region with a 30 deg galactic cut, the FCN successfully recover PS with 90% of completeness corresponding to 300, 139 and 227 mJy for 143, 217 and 353 GHz. On the same validation simulations, the MHW2 with a 4sigma flux density detection limit, recover PS till 298, 173 and 227 mJy at the 90% completeness. In all cases the FCN produce a much lower number of spurious sources with respect the MHW2. As expected, the results on spurious sources for both techniques worsen when increasing the frequency or reducing the galactic cut to 10 deg. Our results suggests that FCN are a very promising approach to detect PS using data from CMB experiments, providing overall better results with respect to the more usual filtering approaches.",2019,[],5
1909.07548,astro-ph,"From the decades of the theoretical studies, it is well known that the formation of the bar triggers the gas funnelling into the central sub-kpc region and leads to the formation of a kinematically cold nuclear stellar disc (NSD). We demonstrate that this mechanism can be used to identify the formation epoch of the Galactic bar, using an N-body/hydrodynamics simulation of an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy. As shown in many previous literature, our simulation shows that the bar formation triggers an intense star formation for ~1 Gyr in the central region, and forms a NSD. As a result, the oldest age limit of the NSD is relatively sharp, and the oldest population becomes similar to the age of the bar. Therefore, the age distribution of the NSD tells us the formation epoch of the bar. We discuss that a major challenge in measuring the age distribution of the NSD in the Milky Way is contamination from other non-negligible stellar components in the central region, such as a classical bulge component. We demonstrate that because the NSD is kinematically colder than the other stellar populations in the Galactic central region, the NSD population can be kinematically distinguished from the other stellar populations, if the 3D velocity of tracer stars are accurately measured. Hence, in addition to the line-of-sight velocities from spectroscopic surveys, the accurate measurements of the transverse velocities of stars are necessary, and hence the near-infrared space astrometry mission, JASMINE, would play a crutial role to identify the formation epoch of the Galactic bar. We also discuss that the accuracy of stellar age estimation is also crucial to measure the oldest limit of the NSD stellar population.",2019,[],5
1907.04491,astro-ph,"Galaxy interaction is considered a key driver of galaxy evolution and star formation (SF) history.

For each galaxy in pairs, the merger stage is identified according to its morphological signatures: incoming phase, at first pericenter passage, at apocenter, in merging phase, and in final coalescence. The effect of interactions is quantified by the global and spatially resolved SF rate relative to the SF rate of a control sample selected for each individual galaxy (equationlogSFR and equationlogsSFR(r), respectively). Analysis of the radial equationlogsSFR(r) distributions shows that galaxy interactions have no significant impact on the equationlogsSFR(r) during the incoming phase. Right after the first pericenter passage, the radial equationlogsSFR(r) profile decreases steeply from enhanced to suppressed activity for increasing galactocentric radius. Later on, SF is enhanced on a broad spatial scale out to the maximum radius we explore (~6.7 kpc) and the enhancement is in general centrally peaked. The extended SF enhancement is also observed for systems at their apocenters and in the coalescence phase, suggesting that interaction-triggered SF is not restricted to the central region of a galaxy. Further explorations of a wide range in parameter space of merger configurations (e.g., mass ratio) are required to constrain the whole picture of interaction-triggered SF.",2019,[],5
1902.02713,astro-ph,"Atmospheric parameters determined via spectral modelling are unavailable for many of the known magnetic early B-type stars. We utilized high-resolution spectra together with NLTE models to measure effective temperatures equation and surface gravities equation of stars for which these measurements are not yet available. We find good agreement between our equation measurements and previous results obtained both photometrically and spectroscopically. For equation, our results are compatible with previous spectroscopic measurements; however, surface gravities of stars previously determined photometrically have been substantially revised. We furthermore find that equation measurements obtained with HARPSpol are typically about 0.1 dex lower than those from comparable instruments. Luminosities were determined using Gaia Data Release 2 parallaxes. We find Gaia parallaxes to be unreliable for bright stars (equation mag) and for binaries; in these cases we reverted to Hipparcos parallaxes. In general we find luminosities systematically lower than those previously reported. Comparison of equation and equation to available rotational and magnetic measurements shows no correlation between either parameter with magnetic data, but a clear slow-down in rotation with both decreasing equation and increasing equation, a result compatible with the expectation that magnetic braking should lead to rapid magnetic spindown that accelerates with increasing mass-loss.",2019,[],5
1910.03608,astro-ph,"Black hole feedback plays a central role in shaping the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of elliptical galaxies. We systematically study the impact of plasma physics on the evolution of ellipticals by performing three-dimensional non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of the interactions of active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets with the CGM including magnetic fields, and cosmic rays (CRs) and their transport processes. We find that the physics of feedback operating on large galactic scales depends very sensitively on plasma physics operating on small scales. Specifically, we demonstrate that: (i) in the purely hydrodynamical case, the AGN jets initially maintain the atmospheres in global thermal balance. However, local thermal instability generically leads to the formation of massive cold disks in the vicinity of the central black hole in disagreement with observations; (ii) including weak magnetic fields prevents the formation of the disks because local B-field amplification in the precipitating cold gas leads to strong magnetic breaking, which quickly extracts angular momentum from the accreting clouds. The magnetic fields transform the cold clouds into narrow filaments that do not fall ballistically; (iii) when plasma composition in the AGN jets is dominated by CRs, and CR transport is neglected, the atmospheres exhibit cooling catastrophes due to inefficient heat transfer from the AGN to CGM despite Coulomb/hadronic CR losses being present; (iv) including CR streaming and heating restores agreement with the observations, i.e., cooling catastrophes are prevented and massive cold central disks do not form. The AGN power is reduced as its energy is utilized efficiently.",2019,[],5
1911.06864,astro-ph,"The ~200 HI clouds observed to be entrained in the Fermi Bubble wind show a trend of increasing maximum VLSR with Galactic latitude. We analyze previous observations and present new data from the Green Bank Telescope that rule out systematic effects as the source of this phenomenon. Instead, it is likely evidence for acceleration of the clouds. The data suggest that clouds in the lower 2 kpc of the Fermi Bubbles, within the Bubble boundaries established from X-ray studies, have an outflow velocity that rises from ~150 - 200 km/s close to the Galactic Center and reaches ~330 km/s at a distance of 2.5 - 3.5 kpc. These parameters are also consistent with the kinematics of UV absorption lines from highly ionized species observed against two targets behind the Fermi Bubbles at equation, and equation. The implied neutral cloud lifetime is 4 - 10 Myr.",2019,[],5
1911.04214,astro-ph,"We are undertaking a large survey of over thirty disks using the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) to see whether the observed dust structures match spectral energy distribution (SED) predictions and have any correlation with stellar properties. GPI can observe near-infrared light scattered from dust in circumstellar environments using high-resolution Polarimetric Differential Imaging (PDI) with coronagraphy and adaptive optics. The data have been taken in J and H bands over two years, with inner working angles of 0.08' and 0.11' respectively. Ahead of the release of the complete survey results, here we present five objects with extended and irregular dust structures within 2' of the central star. These objects are: FU Ori; MWC 789; HD 45677; Hen 3-365; and HD 139614. The observed structures are consistent with each object being a pre-main-sequence star with protoplanetary dust. The five objects' circumstellar environments could result from extreme youth and complex initial conditions, from asymmetric scattering patterns due to shadows cast by misaligned disks, or in some cases from interactions with companions. We see complex Uphi structures in most objects that could indicate multiple scattering or result from the illumination of companions. Specific key findings include the first high-contrast observation of MWC 789 revealing a newly-discovered companion candidate and arc, and two faint companion candidates around Hen 3-365. These two objects should be observed further to confirm whether the companion candidates are co-moving. Further observations and modeling are required to determine the causes of the structures.",2019,[],5
1907.09089,astro-ph,"The low temperatures and high ultraviolet (UV) radiation levels at the surface of Mars today currently preclude the survival of life anywhere except perhaps in limited subsurface niches. Several ideas for making the martian surface more habitable have been put forward previously, but they all involve massive environmental modification that will be well beyond human capability for the foreseeable future. Here we present a new approach to this problem. We show that widespread regions of the surface of Mars could be made habitable to photosynthetic life in the future via a solid-state analogue to Earth's atmospheric greenhouse effect. Specifically, we demonstrate via experiments and modelling that under martian environmental conditions, a 2 to 3-cm thick layer of silica (SiO2) aerogel will simultaneously transmit sufficient visible light for photosynthesis, block hazardous ultraviolet radiation, and raise temperatures underneath permanently to above the melting point of water, without the need for any internal heat source. Placing silica aerogel shields over sufficiently ice-rich regions of the martian surface could therefore allow photosynthetic life to survive there with minimal subsequent intervention. This regional approach to making Mars habitable is much more achievable than global atmospheric modification. In addition, it can be developed systematically starting from minimal resources, and can be further tested in extreme environments on Earth today.",2019,[],5
1908.00771,astro-ph,"We present an enhanced version of the multiwavelength spectral modeling code MAGPHYS that allows the estimation of galaxy photometric redshift and physical properties (e.g., stellar mass, star formation rate, dust attenuation) simultaneously, together with robust characterization of their uncertainties. The self-consistent modeling over ultraviolet to radio wavelengths in MAGPHYSphoto-z is unique compared to standard photometric redshift codes. The broader wavelength consideration is particularly useful for breaking certain degeneracies in color vs. redshift for dusty galaxies with limited observer-frame ultraviolet and optical data (or upper limits). We demonstrate the success of the code in estimating redshifts and physical properties for over 4,000 infrared-detected galaxies at 0.4<z<6.0 in the COSMOS field with robust spectroscopic redshifts. We achieve high photo-z precision (equation), high accuracy (i.e., minimal offset biases; medianequation), and low catastrophic failure rates (equation) over all redshifts. Interestingly, we find that a weak 2175A absorption feature in the attenuation curve models is required to remove a subtle systematic photo-z offset (equation) that occurs when this feature is not included. As expected, the accuracy of derived physical properties in MAGPHYSphoto-z decreases strongly as redshift uncertainty increases. The all-in-one treatment of uncertainties afforded with this code is beneficial for accurately interpreting physical properties of galaxies in large photometric datasets. Finally, we emphasize that MAGPHYSphoto-z is not intended to replace existing photo-z codes, but rather offer flexibility to robustly interpret physical properties when spectroscopic redshifts are unavailable. The MAGPHYSphoto-z code is publicly available online.",2019,[],5
1905.12633,astro-ph,"The Ophiuchus stream is a short arc-like stellar feature of uncertain origin located equation kpc North of the Galactic centre. New proper motions from the second equation data release reconcile the direction of motion of stream members with the stream arc, resolving a puzzling mismatch reported in earlier work. We use N-body simulations to show that the stream is likely only on its second pericentric passage, and thus was formed recently. The simulations suggest that the entire disrupted progenitor is visible in the observed stream today, and that little further tidal debris lies beyond the ends of the stream. The luminosity, length, width, and velocity dispersion of the stream suggest a globular cluster (GC) progenitor substantially fainter and of lower surface brightness than estimated in previous work, and unlike any other known globulars in the Galaxy. This result suggests the existence of clusters that would extend the known GC population to fainter and more weakly bound systems than hitherto known. How such a weakly-bound cluster of old stars survived until it was disrupted so recently, however, remains a mystery. Integrating backwards in time, we find that the orbits of Sagittarius and Ophiuchus passed within equation kpc of each other about equation Myrs ago, an interaction that might help resolve this puzzle.",2019,[],5
1904.05219,astro-ph,"The understanding of the rotational evolution of early-type stars is deeply related to that of anisotropic mass and angular momentum loss. In this paper, we aim to clarify the rotational evolution of rapidly rotating early-type stars along the main sequence (MS). We have used the 2D ESTER code to compute and evolve isolated rapidly rotating early-type stellar models along the MS, with and without anisotropic mass loss. We show that stars with equation and masses between equation and equation reach criticality during the main sequence provided their initial angular velocity is larger than 50% of the Keplerian one. More massive stars are subject to radiation-driven winds and to an associated loss of mass and angular momentum. We find that this angular momentum extraction from the outer layers can prevent massive stars from reaching critical rotation and greatly reduce the degree of criticality at the end of the MS. Our model includes the so-called bi-stability jump of the equation relation of 1D-models. This discontinuity now shows up in the latitude variations of the mass-flux surface density, endowing rotating massive stars with either a single-wind regime (no discontinuity) or a two-wind regime (a discontinuity). In the two-winds-regime, mass loss and angular momentum loss are strongly increased at low latitudes inducing a faster slow-down of the rotation. However, predicting the rotational fate of a massive star is difficult, mainly because of the non-linearity of the phenomena involved and their strong dependence on uncertain prescriptions. Moreover, the very existence of the bi-stability jump in mass-loss rate remains to be substantiated by observations.",2019,[],5
1907.00623,astro-ph,"We present the result of a multi-longitude campaign on the photometric study of the dwarf nova ASASSN-18fk during its superoutburst in 2018. It was observed with 18 telescopes at 15 sites during ~70 nights within a three-month interval. Observations covered the main outburst, six rebrightenings and 50-d decline to a near-quiescent state. We identify ASASSN-18fk as WZ Sge-type dwarf nova with multiple rebrightenings and show the evolution of the 0.06-d superhump period over all stages of the superoutburst. A strong 22-min brightness modulation that superimposed on superhumps is found during rebrightenings and decline. Some evidence of this modulation in a form of a sideband signal is detected during the very onset of the outburst. We interpret the 22-min modulation as a spin period of the white dwarf and suggest that ASASSN-18fk is a good candidate for a superhumping intermediate polar.",2019,[],5
1909.11680,astro-ph,"We present the stellar mass-[Fe/H] and mass-[Mg/H] relation of quiescent galaxies in two galaxy clusters at equation and equation. We derive the age, [Fe/H], and [Mg/Fe] for each individual galaxy using a full-spectrum fitting technique. By comparing with the relations for equation SDSS galaxies, we confirm our previous finding that the mass-[Fe/H] relation evolves with redshift. The mass-[Fe/H] relation at higher redshift has lower normalization and possibly steeper slope. However, based on our sample, the mass-[Mg/H] relation does not evolve over the observed redshift range. We use a simple analytic chemical evolution model to constrain average outflow that these galaxies experience over their lifetime, via the calculation of mass-loading factor. We find that the average mass-loading factor equation is a power-law function of galaxy stellar mass, equation. The measured mass-loading factors are consistent with the results of other observational methods for outflow measurements and with the predictions where outflow is caused by star formation feedback in turbulent disks.",2019,[],5
1903.05188,astro-ph,"We report the identification of the possible optical counterparts of five out of seven Ultraluminous X-ray Sources (ULXs) in NGC 4490/4485 galaxy pair. Using archival Hubble Space Telescope (\it HST) imaging data, we identified a single optical candidate for two ULXs (X-4 and X-7) and multiple optical candidates for the other three ULXs (X-2, X-3 and X-6) within equation equation error radius at the 90\% confidence level. Of the two remaining ULXs, X-1 has no \it HST imaging data and photometry could not be performed due to the position of X-5 in NGC4490. Absolute magnitudes (equation) of the optical candidates lie between equation and equation. Color-Magnitude Diagrams (CMDs) have been used to investigate the properties of counterparts and their environments. The locations of the counterparts of X-2, X-4, and X-6 suggest possible association with nearby group of stars while others have no association with a star cluster or group of stars. For comparison purposes, we analyzed previously unused three archival XMM-Newton observations. The long-term X-ray light curves of the sources (except transient X-7) show variability by a factor of three in a time scale more than a decade.

1901.04508,astro-ph,"Binary supermassive black holes (SMBH) are expected to form naturally during galaxy mergers. After the dynamical friction phase, when the two SMBHs become gravitationally bound to each other, and a brief stage of initial rapid hardening, the orbit gradually continues to shrink due to three-body interactions with stars that enter the loss cone of the binary. Using the stellar-dynamical Monte Carlo code Raga, we explore the co-evolution of the binary SMBH and the nuclear star cluster in this slow stage, for various combinations of parameters (geometry of the star cluster, primary/secondary SMBH mass, initial eccentricity, inclusion of stellar captures/tidal disruptions). We compare the rates of stellar captures in galactic nuclei containing a binary to those of galaxies with a single SMBH. At early times, the rates are substantially higher in the case of a binary SMBH, but subsequently they drop to lower levels. Only in triaxial systems both the binary hardening rates and the capture rates remain sufficiently high during the entire evolution. We find that the hardening rate is not influenced by star captures, nor does it depend on eccentricity; however, it is higher when the difference between the black hole masses is greater. We confirm that the eccentricity of the binary tends to grow, which may significantly shorten the coalescence time due to earlier onset of gravitational-wave emission. We also explore the properties of the orbits entering the loss cone, and demonstrate that it remains partially full throughout the evolution in the triaxial case, but significantly depleted in the axisymmetric case. Finally, we study the distribution of ejected hypervelocity stars and the corresponding mass deficits in the central parts of the galaxies hosting a binary, and argue that the missing mass is difficult to quantify observationally.",2019,[],5
1910.00595,astro-ph,"Thin stellar streams, formed from the tidal disruption of globular clusters, are important gravitational tools, sensitive to both global and small-scale properties of dark matter. The Palomar 5 stellar stream (Pal 5) is an exemplar stream within the Milky Way: Its equation tidal tails connect back to the progenitor cluster, and the stream has been used to study the shape, total mass, and substructure fraction of the dark matter distribution of the Galaxy. However, most details of the phase-space distribution of the stream are not fully explained, and dynamical models that use the stream for other inferences are therefore incomplete. Here we aim to measure distance and kinematic properties along the Pal 5 stream in order to motivate improved models of the system. We use a large catalog of RR Lyrae-type stars (RRLs) with astrometric data from the Gaia mission to probabilistically identify RRLs in the Pal 5 stream. RRLs are useful because they are intrinsically-luminous standard candles and their distances can be inferred with small relative precision (equation). By building a probabilistic model of the Pal 5 cluster and stream in proper motion and distance, we find 27 RRLs consistent with being members of the cluster (10) and stream (17). Using these RRLs, we detect gradients in distance and proper motion along the stream, and provide an updated measurement of the distance to the Pal 5 cluster using the RRLs, equation. We provide a catalog of Pal 5 RRLs with inferred membership probabilities for future modeling work.",2019,[],5

In narrow slice profiles along the major axis (with bin sizes ranging from 1.7 x 0.5 kpc to 1.7 x 7.8 kpc), we achieve a depth of ~29-30 mag/arcsec2. We confirm the previously observed asymmetric disc truncation. In addition, the sharp northwest truncation turns over to a shallower component that coincides with a fan-like feature seen to wrap around the northwest disc limb. We propose that the fan may be a tidal ribbon, and qualitatively replicate the fan with simple simulations. Alternative explanations of the fan and the disc's asymmetry are considered as well.

1904.07610,astro-ph,"The accurate determination of the galaxy cluster mass-observable relations is one of the major challenge of modern astrophysics and cosmology. We present a new statistical methodology to constrain the evolution of the mass-observable relations. Instead of measuring individual mass of galaxy clusters, we only consider large scale homogeneity of the Universe. In this case, we expect the present galaxy cluster mass function to be the same everywhere in the Universe. Using relative abundance matching, we contraint the relation between the richness, equation, and the expected present mass, equation, of galaxy clusters. We apply this approach to the redMaPPer galaxy cluster catalogue in 10 redshift bins from equation to equation. We found that the equation-equation relation is not evolving from equation to equation, whereas it starts to significantly evolve at higher redshift. This results implies that the redMaPPer richness appears to be a better proxy for the expected present-day galaxy cluster mass than for the mass at the observational redshift. Assuming cosmology and galaxy cluster mass accretion history, it is possible to convert equation to the mass at the galaxy cluster redshift equation. We found a significant evolution of the equation-equation over all the covered redshift range. Consequently, we provide a new redshift-dependent richness-mass relation for the redMaPPer galaxy cluster catalogue. This results demonstrates the efficiency of this new methodology to probe the evolution of scaling relations compared to individual galaxy cluster mass estimation.",2019,[],5
1906.07724,astro-ph,"Kinematic studies have produced accurate measurements of the total dark matter mass and mean dark matter density within the optical extent of galaxies, for large samples of objects. Here we consider theoretical predictions for the latter quantity, equation, measured within the isophotal radius equation, for isolated halos with universal density profiles. Through a combination of empirical scaling relations, we show that equation is expected to depend weakly on halo mass and strongly on redshift. When galaxy halos fall into larger groups or clusters they become tidally stripped, reducing their total dark matter mass, but this process is expected to preserve central density until an object is close to disruption. We confirm this with collisonless simulations of cluster formation, finding that subhalos have values of equation close to the analytic predictions. This suggests that equation may be a useful indicator of infall redshift onto the cluster. We test this hypothesis with data from the SHIVir survey, which covers a reasonable fraction of the Virgo cluster. We find that galaxies with high equation do indeed trace the densest regions of the cluster, with a few notable exceptions. Samples selected by environment have higher densities at a significance of 3.5-4equation, while samples selected by density are more clustered at 3-3.5equation significance. We conclude that halo density can be a powerful tracer of the assembly history of clusters and their member galaxies.",2019,[],5

1907.01179,astro-ph,"We demonstrate the sensitivity of magnetic energy and helicity computations regarding the quality of the underlying coronal magnetic field model. We apply the method of Wiegelmann & Inhester (2010) to a series of SDO/HMI vector magnetograms, and discuss nonlinear force-free (NLFF) solutions based on two different sets of the free model parameters. The two time series differ from each other concerning their force-free and solenoidal quality. Both force- and divergence-freeness are required for a consistent NLFF solution. Full satisfaction of the solenoidal property is inherent in the definition of relative magnetic helicity in order to insure gauge-independence. We apply two different magnetic helicity computation methods (Thalmann et al. 2011; Valori et al. 2012) to both NLFF time series and find that the output is highly dependent on the level to which the NLFF magnetic fields satisfy the divergence-free condition, with the computed magnetic energy being less sensitive than the relative helicity. Proxies for the non-potentiality and eruptivity derived from both quantities are also shown to depend strongly on the solenoidal property of the NLFF fields. As a reference for future applications, we provide quantitative thresholds for the force- and divergence-freeness, for the assurance of reliable computation of magnetic energy and helicity, and of their related eruptivity proxies.",2019,[],5

A tidal-seismic resonance is expected when a tidal force frequency matches a free-oscillation frequency of the planet. Here we show that when the moon is close to the planet, the tidal-seismic resonance can cause large-amplitude seismic waves, which can change the shape of the planet and in turn exert a negative torque on the moon to cause it to fall rapidly toward the planet. We postulate that the tidal-seismic resonance may be an important mechanism which can accelerate planet accretion process.

1904.00343,astro-ph,"Stellar bow shocks, bow waves, and dust waves all result from the action of a star's wind and radiation pressure on a stream of dusty plasma that flows past it. The dust in these bows emits prominently at mid-infrared wavelengths in the range 8 to 60 micron. We propose a novel diagnostic method, the tau-eta diagram, for analyzing these bows, which is based on comparing the fractions of stellar radiative energy and stellar radiative momentum that is trapped by the bow shell. This diagram allows the discrimination of wind-supported bow shocks, radiation-supported bow waves, and dust waves in which grains decouple from the gas. For the wind-supported bow shocks, it allows the stellar wind mass-loss rate to be determined. We critically compare our method with a previous method that has been proposed for determining wind mass-loss rates from bow shock observations. This comparison points to ways in which both methods can be improved and suggests a downward revision by a factor of two with respect to previously reported mass-loss rates. From a sample of 23 mid-infrared bow-shaped sources, we identify at least 4 strong candidates for radiation-supported bow waves, which need to be confirmed by more detailed studies, but no strong candidates for dust waves.",2019,[],5
1905.06955,astro-ph,"We investigate a sample of 152 dusty sources at 1:5 < z < 2:5 to understand the connection of enhanced Star-Formation-Rate (SFR) and Black-Hole-Accretion-Rate (BHAR). The sources are Herschel-selected, having stellar masses M*>1010Msun and SFR (100-1000Msun/yr) elevated(>4?) above the star-forming ""main sequence"", classifying them as Starbursts (SB). Through a multiwavelength fitting approach (including a dusty torus component), we divided the sample into active SBs (dominated by an AGN emission, SBs-AGN, ? 23% of the sample) and purely star-forming SBs (SBs-SFR). We visually inspected their HST/UV-restframe maps: SBs-SFR are generally irregular and composite systems; ? 50% of SBs-AGN are instead dominated by regular compact morphologies. We then found archival ALMA continuum counterparts for 33 galaxies (12 SBs-AGN and 21 SBs-SFR). For these sources we computed dust masses, and, with standard assumptions, we also guessed total molecular gas-masses. SBs turn to be gas rich systems (fgas = Mgas=Mgas/(MgasM*) \sim 20%-70%), and the gas fractions of the two SB classes are very similar (fgas = 43 /-4% and fgas = 42/- 2%). Our results show that SBs are consistent with a mixture of: 1) highly star-forming merging systems (dominating the SBs-SFR), and 2) primordial galaxies, rapidly growing their M* together with their Black Hole (mainly the more compact SBs-AGN). Anyway, feedback effects have not reduced their fgas yet. Indeed, SBs at z = 2, with relatively low bolometric AGN luminosities in the range 1044 < Lbol(AGN) < 1046 erg/s (compared to bright optical and X-ray quasars), are still relatively far from the epoch when the AGN feedback will quench the SFR in the host and will substantially depress the gas fractions.",2019,[],5
1910.05350,astro-ph,"Giant planets are thought to form by runaway gas accretion onto solid cores. Growth must eventually stop running away, ostensibly because planets open gaps (annular cavities) in their surrounding discs. Typical models stop runaway by artificially capping the accretion rate and lowering it to zero over an arbitrarily short time-scale. In reality, post-runaway accretion persists as long as the disc remains. During this final and possibly longest phase of formation, when the planet is still emerging from the disc, its mass can more than double, and its radius contracts by orders of magnitude. By drawing from the theory of how gaps clear, we find that post-runaway accretion luminosities diverge depending on disc viscosity: luminosities fall in low-viscosity discs but continue to rise past runaway in high-viscosity discs. This divergence amounts to a factor of equation by the time the disc disperses. Irrespective of the specifics of how planets interact with discs, the observed luminosity and age of an accreting planet can be used to calculate its instantaneous mass, radius, and accretion rate. We perform this exercise for the planet candidates embedded within the discs orbiting PDS 70, HD 163296, and MWC 758, inferring masses of equation, accretion rates of equation/Myr, and radii of equation. Our radii are computed self-consistently from the planet's concurrent contraction and accretion and do not necessarily equal the value of equation commonly assumed; in particular, the radius depends on the envelope opacity as equation.",2019,[],5

For Grus II, out of the four RRLs detected, one is consistent with being a member of the galactic halo (Dequation=24equation1 kpc, equation=16.86equation0.10 mag), another is at Dequation=55equation2 kpc (equation=18.71equation0.10 mag), which we associate with Grus II, and the two remaining at Dequation=43equation2 kpc (equation=18.17equation0.10 mag). Moreover, the appearance of a subtle red horizontal branch in the color-magnitude diagram of Grus II at the same brightness level of the latter two RRLs, which are at the same distance and in the same region, suggests that a more metal-rich system may be located in front of Grus II. The most plausible scenario is the association of these stars with the Chenab/Orphan Stream. Finally, we performed a comprehensive and updated analysis of the number of RRLs in dwarf galaxies. This allows us to predict that the method of finding new ultra-faint dwarf galaxies by using two or more clumped RRLs will work only for systems brighter than Mequation mag.",2019,[],5
1904.09329,astro-ph,"We conduct a search for periodic emission in the very high-energy gamma-ray band (VHE; E > 100 GeV) from a total of 13 pulsars in an archival VERITAS data set with a total exposure of over 450 hours. The set of pulsars includes many of the brightest young gamma-ray pulsars visible in the Northern Hemisphere. The data analysis resulted in non-detections of pulsed VHE gamma rays from each pulsar. Upper limits on a potential VHE gamma-ray flux are derived at the 95% confidence level above three energy thresholds using two methods. These are the first such searches for pulsed VHE emission from each of the pulsars, and the obtained limits constrain a possible flux component manifesting at VHEs as is seen for the Crab pulsar.",2019,[],5
1901.01714,astro-ph,"Recent theoretical works suggest that the pebble accretion process is important for planet formation in protoplanetary disks, because it accelerates the growth of planetary cores. While several observations reveal axisymmetric sharp gaps in very young disks, which may be indicative of the existence of planets. We investigate the possibility of planet formation via pebble accretion in much earlier phases, the gravitationally unstable disks of class 0/I young stellar objects. We find that under the conditions of the class 0/I disks, the pebble accretion timescales can be shorter compared to the typical protoplanetary disks due to larger gas and dust accretion rate, but also find that the accretion timescale is not always a decreasing function of the gas accretion rate. By using estimated accretion timescales, we give a required initial mass to form cores of gas giants within the lifetime of class 0/I phases under several parameters, such as radial distances from the host star, gas accretion rates, and dust-to-gas mass ratio. In the most optimistic case, for example the dust-to-gas mass ratio is equation, equation objects at 10 au can grow to equation cores during the typical lifetime of the class 0/I phases, 0.5 Myr.",2019,[],5
1910.13154,astro-ph,"Low-resolution spectra are proved competitive to high-resolution spectra in determining many stellar labels at comparable precision. It is useful to consider the spectral information content when assessing the capability of a stellar spectrum in deriving precise stellar labels. In this work, we quantify the information content brought by the LAMOST-II medium-resolution spectroscopic survey (MRS) using the gradient spectra and the coefficients-of-dependence (CODs). In general, the wavelength coverage of the MRS well constrains the stellar labels but the sensitivities of different stellar labels vary with spectral types and metallicity of the stars of interest and, therefore, affect the performance of the stellar label determination from the MRS spectra. Applying the SLAM to the synthetic spectra which mimic the MRS data, we find the precision of the fundamental stellar parameters Teff, logg and [M/H] are better when combining both the blue and red bands of the MRS. This is especially important for warm stars since the Hequation line located in the red part plays a more important role in determining the effective temperature for warm stars. With blue and red parts together, we are able to reach similar performance to the low-resolution spectra except for warm stars. However, at [M/H]equation dex, the uncertainties of fundamental stellar labels estimated from MRS are substantially larger than those from low-resolution spectra. We also tested the uncertainties of Teff, logg and [M/H] of from MRS data induced from the radial velocity mismatch and find that a mismatch of about 1 km sequation, which is typical for LAMOST MRS data, would not significantly affect the stellar label estimates. At last, reference precision limits are calculated using synthetic gradient spectra, according to which we expect abundances of at least 17 elements to be measured precisely from MRS spectra.",2019,[],5
1904.10579,astro-ph,"We present new radial velocity (RV) measurements for 11 candidate young very-low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, with spectral types from M7 to L7. Candidate young objects were identified by features indicative of low surface gravity in their optical and/or near-infrared spectra. RV measurements are derived from high resolution (R=equation/equation=20,000) equation band spectra taken with NIRSPEC at the Keck Observatory. We combine RVs with proper motions and trigonometric distances to calculate three-dimensional space positions and motions and to evaluate membership probabilities for nearby young moving groups (NYMGs). We propose 2MASS J004521431634446 (L2equation, equation=13.06) as an RV standard given the precision and stability of measurements from three different studies. We test the precision and accuracy of our RV measurements as a function of spectral type of the comparison object, finding that RV results are essentially indistinguishable even with differences of equation5 spectral subtypes. We also investigate the strengths of gravity-sensitive K~\sc i lines at 1.24--1.25 equationm and evaluate their consistency with other age indicators. We confirm or re-confirm four brown dwarf members of NYMGs -- 2MASS J004521431634446, WISE J004700386803543, 2MASS J01174748equation3403258, and 2MASS J19355595equation2846343 -- and their previous age estimates.

The remaining objects do not appear to be members of any known NYMGs, despite their spectral signatures of youth.

1910.04053,astro-ph,"We present a detailed study of the Orion B clouds (d~400 pc), imaged with the PACS/SPIRE cameras at 70-500 equationm by the Herschel Gould Belt survey (HGBS). We release new high-res. maps of column density and dust temperature. In the filamentary sub-regions NGC2023/2024, NGC2068/2071, and L1622, 1768 starless dense cores were identified, ~28-45% of which are self-gravitating prestellar cores. A total of 76 protostellar dense cores were also found. The typical lifetime of the prestellar cores was found to be equation Myr. The prestellar core mass function (CMF) peaks at ~0.5 equation and is consistent with a power law with log slope -1.27equation0.24 at the high-mass end, compared to the Salpeter slope of -1.35. In this region, we confirm the existence of a transition in prestellar core formation efficiency (CFE) around a fiducial value AVbg~7 mag in background visual extinction, similar to the trend observed with Herschel in other clouds. This is not a sharp threshold, but a smooth transition between a regime with very low prestellar CFE at AVbg<5 and a regime with higher, roughly constant CFE at AVbgequation10. The total mass in the form of prestellar cores represents only ~20% of the dense molecular cloud gas at AVbgequation7 mag. About 60-80% of the prestellar cores are closely associated with filaments, and this fraction increases up to >90% when a more complete sample of filamentary structures is considered. Interestingly, the median separation between nearest core neighbors corresponds to the typical inner filament width of ~0.1 pc commonly observed in nearby molecular clouds. Analysis of the CMF observed as a function of background cloud column density shows that the most massive prestellar cores are spatially segregated in the highest column density areas, and suggests that both higher- and lower-mass prestellar cores may form in denser filaments.",2019,[],5
1905.04944,astro-ph,"In this paper, we explore the behavior of optical polarization during the multi-wavelength outburst of the blazar Mrk 421 detected in February 2010. We use optical polarization measurements in the wavelength range 500-700 nm from SPOL observations available between January 1, 2010 and March 31, 2010 (MJD 55197-55286) including the period of multi-wavelength flaring activity detected from the source around February 16-17, 2010 (MJD 55243-55244). We also use near simultaneous optical and radio flux measurements from SPOL in V and R bands and OVRO at 15 GHz respectively. We find that the emissions in the optical and radio bands do not show any significant change in the source activity unlike at X-ray and equation--ray energies during the outburst. The optical and radio flux measurements are found to be consistent with the long term quiescent state emission of the source. Moreover, the linear polarization in the wavelength range 500-700 nm decreases to a minimum value of 1.6equation during the X-ray and equation--ray outburst which is significantly lower than the long term average value of equation 4.2equation. The angle of polarization varies between 114equation-163equation with a preferred average value of equation 137equation during this period. We estimate the degree of polarization intrinsic to the jet taking into account the host galaxy contamination in R band and compare this with the theoretical synchrotron polarization estimated for a power law distribution of relativistic electrons gyrating in an emission region filled with ordered and chaotic magnetic fields. The intrinsic linear polarization estimated for different epochs during the above period is found to be consistent with the theoretical synchrotron polarization produced by the relativistic electrons with power law spectral index equation 2.2.",2019,[],5
1908.06410,astro-ph,"We present a radio continuum study of a population of extremely young and starburst galaxies, termed as blueberries at equation 1 GHz using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). We find that their radio-based star formation rate (SFR) is suppressed by a factor of equation 3.4 compared to the SFR based on optical emission lines. This might be due to (i) the young ages of these galaxies as a result of which a stable equilibrium via feedback from supernovae has not yet been established (ii) escape of cosmic ray electrons via diffusion or galactic scale outflows. The estimated non-thermal fraction in these galaxies has a median value of equation0.49, which is relatively lower than that in normal star-forming galaxies at such low frequencies. Their inferred equipartition magnetic field has a median value of 27 equationG, which is higher than those in more evolved systems like spiral galaxies. Such high magnetic fields suggest that small-scale dynamo rather than large-scale dynamo mechanisms might be playing a major role in amplifying magnetic fields in these galaxies.",2019,[],5
1909.07241,astro-ph,"Accreting white dwarfs in binary systems known as cataclysmic variables (CVs) have in recent years been shown to produce radio flares during outbursts, qualitatively similar to those observed from neutron star and black hole X-ray binaries, but their ubiquity and energetic significance for the accretion flow has remained uncertain. We present new radio observations of the CV SS Cyg with Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array, which show for the second time late-ouburst radio flaring, in April 2016. This flaring occurs during the optical flux decay phase, about ten days after the well-established early-time radio flaring. We infer that both the early- and late-outburst flares are a common feature of the radio outbursts of SS Cyg, albeit of variable amplitudes, and probably of all dwarf novae. We furthermore present new analysis of the physical conditions in the best-sampled late-outburst flare, from Feb 2016, which showed clear optical depth evolution. From this we can infer that the synchrotron-emitting plasma was expanding at about 1% of the speed of light, and at peak had a magnetic field of order 1 Gauss and total energy content > 1033 erg. While this result is independent of the geometry of the synchrotron-emitting region, the most likely origin is in a jet carrying away a significant amount of the available accretion power.",2019,[],5
1907.00809,astro-ph,"Short gamma-ray bursts require a rotating black hole, surrounded by a magnetized relativistic accretion disk, such as the one formed by coalescing binary neutron stars or neutron star - black hole systems. The accretion onto a Kerr black hole is the mechanism of launching a baryon-free relativistic jet. An additional uncollimated outflow, consisting of sub-relativistic neutron-rich material which becomes unbound by thermal, magnetic and viscous forces, is responsible for blue and red kilonova. We explore the formation, composition and geometry of the secondary outflow by means of simulating accretion disks with relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics and employing realistic nuclear equation of state. We calculate the nucleosynthetic r-process yields by sampling the outflow with a dense set of tracer particles. Nuclear heating from the residual r-process radioactivities in the freshly synthesized nuclei is expected to power a red kilonova, contributing independently from the dynamical ejecta component, launched at the time of merger, and neutron-poor broad polar outflow, launched from the surface of the hypermassive neutron star by neutrino wind. Our simulations show that both magnetisation of the disk and high black hole spin are able to launch fast wind outflows (equation) with a broad range of electron fraction equation, and help explain the multiple components observed in the kilonova lightcurves. The total mass loss from the post-merger disk via unbound outflows is between 2\% and 17\% of the initial disk mass.",2019,[],5
1909.02984,astro-ph,"We present a study of the diffuse X-ray emission from the star forming region LMC-N 57 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We use archival XMM-Newton observations to unveil in detail the distribution of hot bubbles in this complex. X-ray emission is detected from the central superbubble (SB) DEM L 229, the supernova remnant (SNR) 0532equation675 and the Wolf-Rayet (WR) bubble DEM L 231 around the WR star Br 48. Comparison with infrared images unveils the powerful effect of massive stars in destroying their nurseries. The distribution of the hot gas in the SNR and the SB display their maxima in regions in contact with the filamentary cold material detected by IR images. Our observations do not reveal extended X-ray emission filling DEM L 231, although several point-like sources are detected in the field of view of this WR nebula. The X-ray properties of Br 48 are consistent with a binary WN4equationO as proposed by other authors. We modeled the X-ray emission from the SB and found that its X-ray emission can be simply explained by pressure-driven wind model, that is, there is no need to invoke the presence of a SN explosion as previously suggested. The pressure calculations of the hot gas confirms that the dynamical evolution of the SB DEM L 229 is dominated by the stellar winds from the star cluster LH 76.",2019,[],5
1909.03781,astro-ph,"Current theories and models attempt to explain star formation globally, from core scales to giant molecular cloud scales. A multi-scale observational characterisation of an entire molecular complex is necessary to constrain them. We investigate star formation in G202.32.5, a ~10x3 pc sub-region of the Monoceros OB1 cloud with a complex morphology harbouring interconnected filamentary structures. We aim to connect the evolution of cores and filaments in G202.32.5 with the global evolution of the cloud and to identify the engines of the cloud dynamics. In this first paper, the star formation activity is evaluated by surveying the distributions of dense cores and protostars, and their evolutionary state, as characterised using both infrared observations from the Herschel and WISE telescopes and molecular line observations with the IRAM 30-m telescope. We find ongoing star formation in the whole cloud, with a local peak in star formation activity around the centre of G202.32.5 where a chain of massive cores (10-50 Msun) forms a massive ridge (>150 Msun). All evolutionary stages from starless cores to Class II protostars are found in G202.32.5, including a possibly starless, large column density (8x1022 cm-2), and massive (52 Msun) core. All the core-scale observables examined in this paper point to an enhanced star formation activity centred on the junction between the three main branches of the ramified structure of G202.32.5. This suggests that the increased star-formation activity results from the convergence of these branches. To further investigate the origin of this enhancement, it is now necessary to extend the analysis to larger scales, in order to examine the relationship between cores, filaments and their environment. We address these points through the analysis of the dynamics of G202.32.5 in a joint paper.",2019,[],5
1907.02542,astro-ph,"The binary star Par 1802 in the Orion Nebula presents an interesting puzzle in the field of stellar dynamics and evolution. Binary systems such as Par 1802 are thought to form from the same natal material and thus the stellar members are expected to have very similar physical attributes. However, Par 1802's stars have significantly different temperatures despite their identical (within equation) masses of about equation solar mass. The leading proof-of-concept idea is that a third companion gravitationally induced the two stars to orbit closer than their Roche-limit, which facilitated heating through tidal effects. Here we expand on this idea and study the three-body dynamical evolution of such a system, including tidal and pre-main-sequence evolution. We also include tidal heating and mass transfer at the onset of Roche-limit Crossing. We show, as a proof-of-concept, that mass transfer combined with tidal heating can naturally explain the observed temperature discrepancy. We also predict the orbital configuration of the possible tertiary companion. Finally we suggest that the dynamical evolution of such a system has pervasive consequences. We expect an abundance of systems to undergo mass transfer during their pre-main-sequence time, which can cause temperature differences.",2019,[],5

The X-ray absorbing column is consistent with interstellar absorption. XMM-Newton observed a flare, during which a transit of the candidate CVSO 30 b was expected, but no significant transit-induced variation in the X-ray flux is detectable.

1909.04867,astro-ph,"The deceptive simplicity of the radius enclosing an arbitrary 50 percent of a galaxy's light has hamstrung the understanding of early-type galaxies (ETGs). Half a century ago, using the ""effective half-light radii"" equation from de Vaucouleurs' equation model, S\'ersic reported that bright ETGs follow the relation equation; and consequently one has that equation and equation, where equation and equation are the effective surface brightness at equation and the mean effective surface brightness within equation, respectively. S\'ersic additionally observed an apparent transition which led him to advocate for a division between what he called dwarf and giant ETGs; a belief frequently restated to occur at equation mag or S\'ersic equation. Here, the location of this false dichotomy is shown to change by more than 3 mag simply depending on the arbitrary percentage of light used to quantify a galaxy's size, voiding claims for different formation physics operating on ETGs brighter and fainter than equation mag. This is of further importance because quantities such as dynamical mass equation, gravitational binding energy equation, acceleration equation, and the ""Fundamental Plane"" depend systematically on the arbitrary percentage of light used to define equation, with implications for dark matter estimates, galaxy formation theories, compact massive galaxies, studies of peculiar velocity flows, and more. Finally, some of the vast literature which has advocated for segregating the ETG population at equation mag (equation-equation) is addressed, and it is revealed how this pervasive mindset has spilled-over to influence both the classical bulge versus pseudobulge debate and recently also correlations involving supermassive black hole masses.",2019,[],5
1907.07208,astro-ph,"Comet C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS) has a peculiar volatile composition, with CO being the dominant volatile as opposed to HequationO and one of the largest Nequation/CO ratios ever observed in a comet. Using observations obtained with the \textitSpitzer Space Telescope, NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility, the 3.5-meter ARC telescope at Apache Point Observatory, the Discovery Channel Telescope at Lowell Observatory, and the Arizona Radio Observatory 10-m Submillimeter Telescope we quantified the abundances of 12 different species in the coma of R2 PanSTARRS. We confirm the high abundances of CO and Nequation and heavy depletions of HequationO, HCN, CHequationOH, and HequationCO compared to CO reported by previous studies. We provide the first measurements (or most sensitive measurements/constraints) on HequationO, COequation, CHequation, CequationHequation, OCS, CequationHequation, and NHequation, all of which are depleted relative to CO by at least one to two orders of magnitude compared to values commonly observed in comets. The observed species also show strong enhancements relative to HequationO, and even when compared to other species like CHequation or CHequationOH most species show deviations from typical comets by at least a factor of two to three. The only mixing ratios found to be close to typical are CHequationOH/COequation and CHequationOH/CHequation. While R2 PanSTARRS was located at a heliocentric distance of 2.8 AU at the time of our observations in January/February 2018, we argue that this alone cannot account for the peculiar observed composition of this comet and therefore must reflect its intrinsic composition.

Basic questions still remain regarding jet physics, which new instruments can advance greatly. The ngVLA, LOFAR, JWST and LUVOIR, as well as a Chandra successor, will give higher angular resolution and sensitivity. This will allow us to probe the emission mechanisms and dynamics of jets, and search for links between these areas, magnetic fields, particle acceleration and high-energy emission mechanisms. We stress the need for polarimetry in the X-ray and optical, critical to many of the most important questions in jet physics.

1908.11377,astro-ph,"The presence of planets in binary systems poses interesting problems for planet formation theories, both in cases where planets must have formed in very compact discs around the individual stars and where they are located near the edge of the stable circumbinary region, where in situ formation is challenging. Dust dynamics is expected to play an important role in such systems, since dust trapping at the inner edge of circumbinary discs could aid in situ formation, but would simultaneously starve the circumstellar discs of the solid material needed to form planets. Here we investigate the dynamics of dust in binary systems using Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics. We find that all our simulations tend towards dust trapping in the circumbinary disc, but the timescale on which trapping begins depends on binary mass ratio (equation) and eccentricity as well as the angular momentum of the infalling material. For equation, we find that dust can initially accrete onto the circumstellar discs, but as the circumbinary cavity grows in radius, dust eventually becomes trapped in the circumbinary disc. For equation, we find that increasing the binary eccentricity increases the time required for dust trapping to begin. However, even this longer timescale is likely to be shorter than the planet formation timescale in the inner disc and is insufficient to explain the observed pre-transitional discs. This indicates that increase in companion eccentricity alone is not enough to allow significant transfer of solids from the outer to the inner disc.",2019,[],5
1911.05131,astro-ph,"The accretion of planetesimals onto white dwarf atmospheres allows determination of the composition of this polluting material. This composition is usually inferred from observed pollution levels by assuming it originated from a single body. This paper instead uses a stochastic model wherein polluting planetesimals are chosen randomly from a mass distribution, finding that the single body assumption is invalid in >20% of cases. Planetesimal compositions are modelled assuming parent bodies that differentiated into core, mantle and crust components. Atmospheric levels of Ca, Mg and Fe in the model are compared to a sample of 230 DZ white dwarfs for which such pollution is measured. A good fit is obtained when each planetesimal has its core, mantle and crust fractions chosen independently from logit-normal distributions which lead to average mass fractions of equation, equation and equation. However, achieving this fit requires a factor 4 depletion of Mg relative to stellar material. This depletion is unlikely to originate in planetesimal formation processes, but might occur from heating while the star is on the giant branch. Alternatively the accreted material has stellar abundance, and either the inferred low Mg abundance was caused by an incorrect assumption that Mg sinks slower than Ca and Fe, or there are unmodelled biases in the observed sample. Finally, the model makes predictions for the timescale on which the observed pollutant composition varies, which should be the longer of the sinking and disc timescales, implying variability on decadal timescales for DA white dwarfs.",2019,[],5
1903.10127,astro-ph,"We present chemical abundances for the elements carbon, sodium, and fluorine in 15 red giants of the globular cluster M 4, as well as six red giants of the globular cluster equation Centauri.

The results indicate a significant reduction in the fluorine abundances when compared to previous values from the literature for M 4 and equation Centauri, due to a downward revision in the excitation potentials of the HF(1-0) R9 line used in the analysis. The fluorine abundances obtained for the M 4 red giants are found to be anti-correlated with those of Na, following the typical pattern of abundance variations seen in globular clusters between distinct stellar populations. In M 4, as the Na abundance increases by equation0.4 dex, the F abundance decreases by equation-0.2 dex.

1912.09520,astro-ph,"Understanding the origin of fast radio bursts (FRB's) is a central unsolved problem in astrophysics that is severely hampered by their poorly determined distance scale. Determining the redshift distribution of FRB's appears to require arcsecond angular resolution, in order to associate FRB's with host galaxies. In this paper, we forecast prospects for determining the redshift distribution without host galaxy associations, by cross-correlating FRB's with a galaxy catalog such as the SDSS photometric sample. The forecasts are extremely promising: a survey such as CHIME/FRB that measures catalogs of equation FRB's with few-arcminute angular resolution can place strong constraints on the FRB redshift distribution, by measuring the cross-correlation as a function of galaxy redshift equation and FRB dispersion measure equation. In addition, propagation effects from free electron inhomogeneities modulate the observed FRB number density, either by shifting FRB's between dispersion measure (DM) bins or through DM-dependent selection effects. We show that these propagation effects, coupled with the spatial clustering between galaxies and free electrons, can produce FRB-galaxy correlations which are comparable to the intrinsic clustering signal. Such effects can be disentangled based on their angular and equation dependence, providing an opportunity to study not only FRB's but the clustering of free electrons.",2019,[],5
1905.06770,astro-ph,"I investigate the origin of arc degeneracies in satellite microlens parallax piE measurements with only late time data, e.g., t > t0  tE as seen from the satellite. I show that these are due to partial overlap of a series of osculating, exactly circular, degeneracies in the piE plane, each from a single measurement. In events with somewhat earlier data, these long arcs break up into two arclets, or (with even earlier data) two points, because these earlier measurements give rise to intersecting rather than osculating circles. The two arclets (or points) then constitute one pair of degeneracies in the well-known four-fold degeneracy of space-based microlens parallax. Using this framework of intersecting circles, I show that next-generation microlens satellite experiments could yield good piE determinations with only about five measurements per event, i.e., about 30 observations per day to monitor 1500 events per year. This could plausibly be done with a small (hence cheap, in the spirit of Gould & Yee 2012) satellite telescope, e.g., 20 cm.",2019,[],5
1902.05895,astro-ph,"We derived the three-dimensional velocities of individual stars in a sample of 62 Galactic globular clusters using proper motions from the second data release of the Gaia mission together with the most comprehensive set of line-of-sight velocities with the aim of investigating the rotation pattern of these stellar systems. We detect the unambiguous signal of rotation in 15 clusters at amplitudes which are well above the level of random and systematic errors. For these clusters, we derived the position and inclination angle of the rotation axis with respect to the line of sight and the overall contribution of rotation to the total kinetic energy budget. The rotation strengths are weakly correlated with the half-mass radius, the relaxation time and anticorrelated with the destruction rate, while no significant alignment of the rotation axes with the orbital poles has been observed. This evidence points toward a primordial origin of the systemic rotation in these stellar systems.",2019,[],5
1911.05714,astro-ph,"We evaluate the impact of imaging systematics on the clustering of luminous red galaxies (LRG), emission-line galaxies (ELG) and quasars (QSO) targeted for the upcoming Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. Using Data Release 7 of the DECam Legacy Survey, we study the effects of astrophysical foregrounds, stellar contamination, differences between north galactic cap and south galactic cap measurements, and variations in imaging depth, stellar density, galactic extinction, seeing, airmass, sky brightness, and exposure time before presenting survey masks and weights to mitigate these effects. With our sanitized samples in hand, we conduct a preliminary analysis of the clustering amplitude and evolution of the DESI main targets. From measurements of the angular correlation functions, we determine power law fits equation equationMpc, equation for LRGs and equation equationMpc, equation for ELGs. Additionally, from the angular power spectra, we measure the linear biases and model the scale dependent biases in the weakly nonlinear regime. Both sets of clustering measurements show good agreement with survey requirements for LRGs and ELGs, attesting that these samples will enable DESI to achieve precise cosmological constraints. We also present clustering as a function of magnitude, use cross-correlations with external spectroscopy to infer equation and measure clustering as a function of luminosity, and probe higher order clustering statistics through counts-in-cells moments.",2019,[],5
1904.09677,astro-ph,"We review the current theoretical models of the inward advection of the large scale external magnetic fields in accretion discs. The most plausible theories for launching astrophysical jets rely on strong magnetic fields at the inner parts of the host accretion disks. An internal dynamo can in principle generate small scale magnetic fields in situ but generating a large scale field in a disk seems a difficult task in the dynamo theories. In fact, as far as numerous numerical experiments indicate, a dynamo-generated field in general would not be coherent enough over the large length scales of order the disk's radius. Instead, a large scale poloidal field dragged in from the environment, and compressed by the accretion, provides a more promising possibility. The difficulty in the latter picture, however, arises from the reconnection of the radial field component across the mid-plane which annihilates the field faster than it is dragged inward by the accretion. We review the different mechanisms proposed to overcome these theoretical difficulties. In fact, it turns out, that a combination of different effects, including magnetic buoyancy and turbulent pumping, is responsible for the vertical transport of the field lines toward the surface of the disk. The radial component of the poloidal field vanishes at the mid-plane, which efficiently impedes reconnection, and grows exponentially toward the surface where it can become much larger than the vertical field component. This allows the poloidal field to be efficiently advected to small radii until the allowed bending angle drops to of order unity, and the field can drive a strong outflow.",2019,[],5
1904.06199,astro-ph,"We explore the effectiveness of deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for estimating strong gravitational lens mass model parameters. We have investigated a number of practicalities faced when modelling real image data, such as how network performance depends on the inclusion of lens galaxy light, the addition of colour information and varying signal-to-noise. Our CNN was trained and tested with strong galaxy-galaxy lens images simulated to match the imaging characteristics of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and Euclid. For images including lens galaxy light, the CNN can recover the lens model parameters with an acceptable accuracy, although a 34 per cent average improvement in accuracy is obtained when lens light is removed. However, the inclusion of colour information can largely compensate for the drop in accuracy resulting from the presence of lens light. While our findings show similar accuracies for single epoch Euclid VIS and LSST r-band datasets, we find a 24 per cent increase in accuracy by adding g- and i-band images to the LSST r-band without lens light and a 20 per cent increase with lens light. The best network performance is obtained when it is trained and tested on images where lens light exactly follows the mass, but when orientation and ellipticity of the light is allowed to differ from those of the mass, the network performs most consistently when trained with a moderate amount of scatter in the difference between the mass and light profiles.",2019,[],5
1901.05532,astro-ph,"The Upper Scorpius OB association is the nearest region of recent massive star formation and thus an important benchmark for investigations concerning stellar evolution and planet formation timescales. We present nine EBs in Upper Scorpius, three of which are newly reported here and all of which were discovered from K2 photometry. Joint fitting of the eclipse photometry and radial velocities from newly acquired Keck-I/HIRES spectra yields precise masses and radii for those systems that are spectroscopically double-lined. The binary orbital periods in our sample range from 0.6-100 days, with total masses ranging from 0.2-8 equation. At least 33% of the EBs reside in hierarchical multiples, including two triples and one quadruple. We use these EBs to develop an empirical mass-radius relation for pre-main-sequence stars, and to evaluate the predictions of widely-used stellar evolutionary models. We report evidence for an age of 5-7 Myr which is self-consistent in the mass range of 0.3-5 equation and based on the fundamentally-determined masses and radii of eclipsing binaries (EBs). Evolutionary models including the effects of magnetic fields imply an age of 9-10 Myr. Our results are consistent with previous studies that indicate many models systematically underestimate the masses of low-mass stars by 20-60% based on H-R diagram analyses. We also consider the dynamical states of several binaries and compare with expectations from tidal dissipation theories. Finally, we identify RIK 72 b as a long-period transiting brown dwarf (equation, equation, equation days) and an ideal benchmark for brown dwarf cooling models at 5-10 Myr.",2019,[],5
1904.02876,astro-ph,"With the advent of large scale surveys the manual analysis and classification of individual radio source morphologies is rendered impossible as existing approaches do not scale. The analysis of complex morphological features in the spatial domain is a particularly important task. Here we discuss the challenges of transferring crowdsourced labels obtained from the Radio Galaxy Zoo project and introduce a proper transfer mechanism via quantile random forest regression. By using parallelized rotation and flipping invariant Kohonen-maps, image cubes of Radio Galaxy Zoo selected galaxies formed from the FIRST radio continuum and WISE infrared all sky surveys are first projected down to a two-dimensional embedding in an unsupervised way. This embedding can be seen as a discretised space of shapes with the coordinates reflecting morphological features as expressed by the automatically derived prototypes. We find that these prototypes have reconstructed physically meaningful processes across two channel images at radio and infrared wavelengths in an unsupervised manner. In the second step, images are compared with those prototypes to create a heat-map, which is the morphological fingerprint of each object and the basis for transferring the user generated labels. These heat-maps have reduced the feature space by a factor of 248 and are able to be used as the basis for subsequent ML methods. Using an ensemble of decision trees we achieve upwards of 85.7% and 80.7% accuracy when predicting the number of components and peaks in an image, respectively, using these heat-maps. We also question the currently used discrete classification schema and introduce a continuous scale that better reflects the uncertainty in transition between two classes, caused by sensitivity and resolution limits.",2019,[],5
1909.04435,astro-ph,"We explore the different formation channels of merging double compact objects (DCOs: BH-BH/BH-NS/NS-NS) that went through a ultraluminous X-ray phase (ULX: X-ray sources with apparent luminosity exceeding equation erg sequation). There are many evolutionary scenarios which can naturally explain the formation of merging DCO systems: isolated binary evolution, dynamical evolution inside dense clusters and chemically homogeneous evolution of field binaries. It is not clear which scenario is responsible for the majority of LIGO/Virgo sources. Finding connections between ULXs and DCOs can potentially point to the origin of merging DCOs as more and more ULXs are discovered. We use the StarTrack population synthesis code to show how many ULXs will form merging DCOs in the framework of isolated binary evolution. Our merger rate calculation shows that in the local Universe typically 50% of merging BH-BH progenitor binaries have evolved through a ULX phase. This indicates that ULXs can be used to study the origin of LIGO/Virgo sources. We have also estimated that the fraction of observed ULXs that will form merging DCOs in future varies between 5% to 40% depending on common envelope model and metallicity.",2019,[],5
1906.05520,astro-ph,"Since the mass loss rates are the function of the mean density of the planet and the stellar irradiation, we calculated about 450 models covering planets with different densities and stellar irradiation. Our results show that the mass loss rates are dependent on the stellar irradiation and the mean density. However, the mass loss rates predicted by the energy-limited equation are higher than that of hydrodynamic model when the XUV integrated flux is higher than equation2equation10equation erg/cmequation/s. The overestimation can be revised if the kinetic and thermal energy of the escaping atmosphere is included in the energy-limited equation. We found that the heating efficiencies are proportional to the product of the gravitational potential of the planet and the stellar irradiation. The mean absorption radii of stellar irradiation are 1.1-1.2 Requation for the Jupiter-like planets while they vary in the range of 1.1-1.7 Requation for the planets with smaller sizes. We evaluated the absorption of stellar Lyequation by planetary atmosphere and found that the deeper Lyequation absorptions tend to locate in the high stellar irradiation and low planetary mean density regions, and vice versa. Moreover, planets with mass loss rates higher than 10equation are likely to exhibit obvious absorptions. Finally, we suggested that the absorption levels are related to the inherent properties of the exoplanets. The planets with larger sizes (or lower mean density) show strong Lyequation absorptions. Neptune-like and Earth-like planets tend to have weak Lyequation absorptions because of their small sizes (or high densities).",2019,[],5
1909.04967,astro-ph,"NGC 2345 is a young open cluster hosting seven blue and red supergiants, low metallicity and a high fraction of Be stars which makes it a privileged laboratory to study stellar evolution.   We aim to improve the determination of the cluster parameters and study the Be phenomenon. Our objective is also to characterise its seven evolved stars by deriving their atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances.   We performed a complete analysis combining for the first time equation photometry with spectroscopy as well as equation Data Release 2. We obtained spectra with classification purposes for 76 stars and high-resolution spectroscopy for an in-depth analysis of the blue and red evolved stars. We identify a new red supergiant and 145 B-type likely members within a radius of 18.7equation1.2 arcmin, which implies an initial mass, equation5200 Mequation. We find a distance of 2.5equation0.2 kpc for NGC 2345, placing it at equation=10.2equation0.2 kpc. Isochrone fitting supports an age of 56equation13 Ma, implying masses around 6.5 Mequation for the supergiants. A high fraction of Be stars (equation10equation) is found.

An overabundance of Ba is found, supporting the enhanced equation-process.   NGC 2345 has a low metallicity for its Galactocentric distance, comparable to typical LMC stars.

We identify two events with maxima in 2019 that require urgent follow-up. First, we predict that the nearby M2 dwarf L 338-152 will align with a background source with a closest approach of equation mas on 2019 November equation d. This will cause a peak astrometric shift and photometric amplification of the background source of equation mas and equation mmag respectively.

1901.02850,astro-ph,"The 2019 January 01 flypast of Ultima Thule by the New Horizons spacecraft has provided the author with a new opportunity to test his gas ring model of planetary origin (Prentice, 1978, Moon Planets 19 341). The model proposes that Ultima Thule condensed from the first gas ring shed by the gravitationally contracting protosolar cloud. I use the fully quantified gas ring model to compute the thermal properties of the gas ring in which Ultima condensed and thence to predict the initial bulk chemical composition of the condensate. It is predicted that all KBOs initially contained large stores of CO2 ice and CH4 ices. These make up fractions 0.2210 and 0.0513 of the condensate mass, respectively. Water ice makes up a mass fraction 0.1845, nearly-dry rock has fraction 0.5269 and graphite has 0.0163. Next, I compute the thermal evolution of Ultima, taking into account the radiogenic heat released by the decay of 26Al. Stellar occultation data suggest that Ultima Thule may consist of 2 lobes of radius about 10 km and 7.5 km. The thermal evolution model shows that within 0.2 Myr, the peak internal temperatures are sufficient for a fraction ~0.7 of the CH4 ice in the larger lobe to melt and for a fraction ~0.4 of the CO2 ice to sublime. For the smaller lobe, these fractions are less. Liquid CH4 quickly migrates upwards to the surface and refreezes to form a thick outer shell of CH4 ice. The sublimation of CO2 takes place after the melting of CH4. The possibility now exists for rising CO2 vapour to become trapped beneath the CH4 shell. This may lead to explosive eruptions of the outer shell and destruction of the primordial surface of Ultima and loss of the CO2. If 60% of CO2 is lost, the lobe radii each shrinks by ~5%. Even so, the intensity of 26Al radiogenic heating may not be sufficient to render the surface of Ultima Thule globally smooth, unless the lobe sizes are of order ~15 km.",2019,[],5
1909.08622,astro-ph,"We present a photometric and spectroscopic study of the Milky Way satellite Laevens 3. Using MegaCam/CFHT g and i photometry and Keck II/DEIMOS multi-object spectroscopy, we refine the structural and stellar properties of the system. The Laevens 3 colour-magnitude diagram shows that it is quite metal-poor, old (13.0 -1.0 Gyr), and at a distance of 61.4-1.0 kpc, partly based on two RR Lyrae stars. The system is faint (Mv = -2.80.2-0.3 mag) and compact (r = 11.4-1.0 pc). From the spectroscopy, we constrain the systemic metallicity ([Fe/H]spectro = -1.8-0.1 dex) but the metallicity and velocity dispersions are both unresolved. Using Gaia DR2, we infer a mean proper motion of (mualpha, mudelta) = (0.51-0.28, -0.83-0.27) mas yr-1, which, combined with the system's radial velocity (<vr> = -70.2-0.5 km s-1), translates into a halo orbit with a pericenter and apocenter of 40.75.6-14.7 and 85.617.2-5.9 kpc, respectively.

1905.09559,astro-ph,"Characteristic signatures that X-ray reverberation from an extended corona can manifest in the observed PSD of AGN are investigated. The presence of two X-ray blobs illuminating an accretion disc can cause the interference between two reprocessing-echo components and produce distinct physical features in the PSD. The oscillatory structures (e.g., dips and humps) are seen but, contrarily to the lamp-post case, the strongest dip is not always the one at the lowest frequency. Instead, we find the frequency where the strongest dip is seen associates to the lower-source height while the lowest frequency where the first dip appears links with the upper-source height. This is because the reverberation timescales increase with the source height. Accurate modelling of the PSD then helps put constraints to the lower and upper limit of the corona extent. Furthermore, the reverberation signatures are less pronounced with increasing number of sources that do not produce reflection (e.g., additional X-rays from fast, relativistic outflows). The amplitude of the oscillations also depends on the amount of dilution contributed by the X-ray sources, thus encodes information about their relative brightness. Due to stronger dilutions, robust detection of these signatures with the current observations will become even more difficult if the corona is extended. Future observations made by Athena will enable us to fit these characteristics in statistically significant details, and to reveal the nature of the disc-corona system.",2019,[],5

The sequence of transits occurred 81.6 equation 11.7 seconds earlier than had been predicted, based on data stretching back to 2007. This is unlikely to be the result of a clock error, because TESS observations of other hot Jupiters (WASP-6b, 18b, and 46b) are compatible with a constant period, ruling out an 81.6-second offset at the 6.4equation level. The 1.3-day orbital period of WASP-4b appears to be decreasing at a rate of equation milliseconds per year. The apparent period change might be caused by tidal orbital decay or apsidal precession, although both interpretations have shortcomings. The gravitational influence of a third body is another possibility, though at present there is minimal evidence for such a body.

1904.08867,astro-ph,"Imaging in radio astronomy is usually carried out with a single-dish radio telescope doing a raster scan of a region of the sky or with an interferometer that samples the visibility function of the sky brightness. Mosaic observations are the current standard for imaging large fields of view with an interferometer and multi-frequency observations are now routinely carried out with both types of telescopes to increase the continuum imaging sensitivity and to probe spectral structure. This paper describes an algorithm to combine wideband data from these two types of telescopes in a joint iterative reconstruction scheme that can be applied to spectral cube or wideband multi-term imaging both for narrow fields of view as well as mosaics. Our results demonstrate the ability to prevent instabilities and error that typically arise when wide-band or joint mosaicing algorithms are presented with spatial and spectral structure that is inadequetely sampled by the interferometer alone. For comparable noise levels in the single dish and interferometer data, the numerical behaviour of this algorithm is expected to be similar to the idea of generating artificial visibilities from single dish data. However, our discussed implementation is simpler and more flexible in terms of applying relative data weighting schemes to match noise levels while preserving flux accuracy, fits within standard iterative image reconstruction frameworks, is fully compatible with wide-field and joint mosaicing gridding algorithms that apply corrections specific to the interferometer data and may be configured to enable spectral cube and wideband multi-term deconvolution for single-dish data alone.",2019,[],5

NSDs may be most relevant at equation when obscured accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is common. This paper describes the characteristics of the stellar remnants of NSDs at equation, taking into account the evolution from equation. Using a stellar synthesis model, the colours, masses, and luminosities of the stellar remnants are computed for a suite of 192 two-dimensional NSD models. These properties are compared to observations of local nuclear star clusters (NSCs), and a good match is found between the predicted and observed properties. Dynamical effects will likely cause the final remnant to be a rotating, nearly spherical distribution. In addition, equation% of the NSD remnants have half-light radii <~ 10 pc, consistent with NSCs hosted in both late-type and early-type galaxies, and all the remnants follow similar size-luminosity relationships as observed in nearby NSCs. NSDs require the presence of a central SMBH and the most massive and compact stellar remnants are associated with the most massive SMBHs, although stellar clusters with a variety of sizes can be produced by all considered SMBH masses.

1908.04548,astro-ph,"Galactic astrophysics is now in the process of building a multi-dimensional map of the Galaxy. For such a map, stellar ages are the essential ingredient. Ages are however measured only indirectly by comparing observational data with models. It is often difficult to provide a single age value for a given star, as several non-overlapping solutions are possible. We aim at recovering the underlying log(age) distribution from the measured log(age) probability density function for an arbitrary set of stars. We build an age inversion method, namely, we represent the measured log(age) probability density function as a weighted sum of probability density functions of mono-age populations. Weights in that sum give the underlying log(age) distribution. Mono-age populations are simulated so that the distribution of stars on the log g-[Fe/H] plane is close to that of the observed sample. We tested the age inversion method on simulated data, demonstrating that it is capable of properly recovering the true log(age) distribution for a large (N > 103) sample of stars. The method was further applied to large public spectroscopic surveys. For RAVE-on, LAMOST and APOGEE we also applied age inversion to mono-metallicity samples, successfully recovering age-metallicity trends present in higher-precision APOGEE data and chemical evolution models. We conclude that applying an age inversion method as presented in this work is necessary to recover the underlying age distribution of a large (N > 103 ) set of stars. These age distributions can be used to explore for instance age-metallicity relations.",2019,[],5

1912.04936,astro-ph,"Giant impacts dominate the final stages of terrestrial planet formation and set the configuration and compositions of the final system of planets. A giant impact is believed to be responsible for the formation of Earth's Moon, but the specific impact parameters are under debate. Because the canonical Moon-forming impact is the most intensely studied scenario, it is often considered the archetypal giant impact. However, a wide range of impacts with different outcomes are possible. Here we examine the total energy budgets of giant impacts that form Earth-mass bodies and find that they differ substantially across the wide range of possible Moon-forming events. We show that gravitational potential energy exchange is important, and we determine the regime in which potential energy has a significant effect on the collision outcome. Energy is deposited heterogeneously within the colliding planets, increasing their internal energies, and portions of each body attain sufficient entropy for vaporization. After gravitational re-equilibration, post-impact bodies are strongly thermally stratified, with varying amounts of vaporized and supercritical mantle. The canonical Moon-forming impact is a relatively low energy event and should not be considered the archetype of accretionary giant impacts that form Earth-mass planets. After a giant impact, bodies are significantly inflated in size compared to condensed planets of the same mass, and there are substantial differences in the magnitudes of their potential, kinetic and internal energy components. As a result, the conditions for metal-silicate equilibration and the subsequent evolution of the planet may vary widely between different impact scenarios.",2019,[],5

Understanding the thermodynamic properties of merging clusters can provide crucial information on how they grow in the local universe. A detailed study of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) properties of un-relaxed systems is essential to understand the fate of in-falling structures and, more generally, the virialization process. We analyzed a mosaic of XMM-Newton observations (240 ks) of the Lyra system (z=0.067) that shows a complex dynamical state. We find the main cluster RXC J1825.33026 to be in a late merger phase, whereas its companion CIZA J1824.13029 is a relaxed cool-core cluster. We estimate a mass ratio of ~1:2 for the pair. No diffuse X-ray emission is found in the region between them, indicating that these clusters are in a pre-merger phase. We found evidence of a galaxy group infalling on RXC J1825.33026 in an advanced state of disruption. The Southern Galaxy, one of the brightest galaxies in the Lyra complex, was very likely at the center of the infalling group. This galaxy has a gaseous corona indicating that it was able to retain some of its gas after the ram-pressure stripping of the intra-group medium. In this scenario the diffuse emission excess observed southwest of RXC J1825.33026 could be due to gas once belonging to the group and/or to cluster ICM dislocated by the passage of the group. Finally, we identified three high-velocity galaxies aligned between RXC J1825.33026 and the SG, two of these showing evidence of gas stripped from them during infall. We estimate them to be currently falling onto the main cluster at an infall velocity of ~ 3000 km/s.

We explore the dependence of the scatter of the equation-equation measurements from the star forming regions on different physical parameters, including distance from the nucleus, star formation rate and total dust content. Finally, we compare the measured equation and equation between the individual star forming regions and the integrated galaxy light. We find a strong variation in equation between the kiloparsec scale and the larger galaxy scale not seen in equation. We conclude that the sight-line dependence of UV attenuation and the reddening of equation due to the light from older stellar populations could contribute to the equation-equation discrepancy.",2019,[],5

Sometimes molecular gas is detected in sufficient quantities to allow star formation, but the efficiency is much lower than in disk galaxies.

1903.10015,astro-ph,"The width of the broad emission lines in quasars is commonly characterized either by the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) or the square root of the second moment of the line profile (equation), and used as an indicator of the virial velocity of the broad-line region (BLR) in the estimation of black hole (BH) mass. We measure FWHM and equation for Hequation, Hequation and Mg II broad lines in both the mean and root-mean-square (rms) spectra of a large sample of quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping (SDSS-RM) project. We introduce a new quantitative recipe to measure equation that is reproducible, less susceptible to noise and blending in the wings, and scales with the intrinsic width of the line. We compare the four definitions of line width (FWHM and equation in mean and rms spectra, respectively) for each of the three broad lines and among different lines. There are strong correlations among different width definitions for each line, providing justification for using the line width measured in single-epoch spectroscopy as a virial velocity indicator. There are also strong correlations among different lines, suggesting alternative lines to Hequation can be used to estimate virial BH masses. We further investigate the correlations between virial BH masses using different line width definitions and the stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxies, and the dependence of line shape (characterized by the ratio FWHM/equation) on physical properties of the quasar. Our results provide further evidence that FWHM is more sensitive to the orientation of a flattened BLR geometry than equation, but the overall comparison between the virial BH mass and host stellar velocity dispersion does not provide conclusive evidence that one particular width definition is significantly better than the others.",2019,[],5
1903.03858,astro-ph,"We search for global rotation of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the galaxy cluster Abell 2107, where previous studies have detected rotational motion in the member galaxies with a high significance level. By fitting the centroid of the iron equation line complex at 6.7--6.9 keV rest frame in \sl Chandra ACIS-I spectra, we identify the possible rotation axis with the line that maximizes the difference between the emission-weighted spectroscopic redshift measured in the two halves defined by the line itself. Then, we measure the emission-weighted redshift in linear regions parallel to the preferred rotation axis, and find a significant gradient as a function of the projected distance from the rotation axis, compatible with a rotation pattern with maximum tangential velocity equation km/s at a radius equation kpc. This result, if interpreted in the framework of hydrostatic equilibrium, as suggested by the regular morphology of Abell 2107, would imply a large mass correction of the order of equation at equation kpc, which is incompatible with the cluster morphology itself. A more conservative interpretation may be provided by an unnoticed off-center, head-on collision between two comparable halos. Our analysis confirms the peculiar dynamical nature of the otherwise regular cluster Abell 2107, but is not able to resolve the rotation vs merger scenario, a science case that can be addressed by the next-generation X-ray facilities carrying X-ray bolometers onboard.",2019,[],5
1902.10263,astro-ph,"Jets are a ubiquitous part of the accretion process, seen in a wide variety of objects ranging from active galaxies (AGN) to X-ray binary stars and even newly formed stars. AGN jets are accelerated by the supermassive black hole of their host galaxy by a coupling between the magnetic field and inflowing material. They are the source for many exciting phenomena and can profoundly influence the larger galaxy and surrounding cluster.   This White Paper points out what advances can be achieved in the field by new technologies, concentrating on the zone where jets are accelerated to relativistic speeds and collimated. The ngVLA and new space VLBI missions will give higher angular resolution, sensitivity and fidelity in the radio, penetrating this zone for additional objects and allowing us to resolve fundamental questions over the physics of jet acceleration and collimation. Interferometry in other bands would allow us to probe directly flaring components.

1911.07267,astro-ph,"Classical theories for the stellar initial mass function (IMF) predict a peak mass which scales with the properties of the molecular cloud. In this work, we explore a new theory proposed by Lee & Hennebelle (2018). The idea is that the tidal field around first Larson cores prevents the formation of other collapsing clumps within a certain radius. The protostar can then freely accrete the gas within this radius. This leads to a peak mass of roughly equation, independent of the parent cloud properties. Using simple analytical arguments, we derive a collapse condition for clumps located close to a protostar. We then study the tidal field and the corresponding collapse condition using a series of numerical simulations. We find that the tidal field around protostars is indeed strong enough to prevent clumps from collapsing unless they have high enough densities. For each newly formed protostar, we determine the region in which tidal screening is dominant. We call this the tidal bubble. The mass within this bubble is our estimate for the final mass of the star. Using this formalism, we are able to construct a very good prediction for the final IMF in our simulations. Not only do we correctly predict the peak, but we are also able to reproduced the high and low mass end of the IMF. We conclude that tidal forces are important in determining the final mass of a star and might be the dominant effect in setting the peak mass of the IMF.",2019,[],5
1910.14235,astro-ph,"Feedback is indispensable in galaxy formation. However, lacking resolutions, cosmological simulations often use ad hoc feedback parameters. Conversely, small-box simulations, while better resolving the feedback, cannot capture gas evolution beyond the simulation domain. We aim to bridge the gap by implementing small-box results of supernovae-driven outflows into dark matter halo-scale simulations and studying their impact on large scales. Galactic outflows are multiphase, but small-box simulations show that the hot phase (Tequation 10equation K) carries the majority of energy and metals. We implement hot outflows in idealized simulations of the Milky Way halo, and examine how they impact the circumgalactic medium (CGM). In this paper, we discuss the case when the star formation surface density is low and therefore the emerging hot outflows are gravitationally bound by the halo. We find that outflows form a large-scale, metal-enriched atmosphere with fountain motions. As hot gas accumulates, the inner atmosphere becomes ""saturated"". Cool gas condenses, with a rate balancing the injection of the hot outflows. This balance leads to a universal density profile of the hot atmosphere, independent of mass outflow rate. The atmosphere has a radially-decreasing temperature, naturally producing the observed X-ray luminosity and column densities of O VI, O VII, O VIII. The self-regulated atmosphere has a baryon and a metal mass of equation and equation, respectively, small compared to the 'missing"" baryons and metals from the halo. We conjecture that the missing materials reside at even larger radii, ejected by more powerful outflows in the past.",2019,[],5
1902.02969,astro-ph,"This paper studies morphological properties of 103 green valley FIR active and 2609 non-active galaxies presented in Mahoro et al. 2017. The photometric data from the COSMOS survey were used, and the morphological parameters, such as Abraham and Conselice-Bershady concentration indices, Gini, M20 moment of light, and asymmetry, were analysed taking into account public catalogues. Furthermore, a visual classification of galaxies was performed. We found that the fraction of peculiar galaxies with clear signs of interactions and mergers is significantly higher in AGN (38%) than non-AGN (19%) green valley galaxies, while non-AGN galaxies from our sample are predominantly spirals (46%). We found that the largest fraction of our green valley galaxies is located on the main-sequence (MS) of star formation, independently on morphology, which is in contrast with most of previous studies carried out in optical. We also found that FIR AGN green valley galaxies have significantly higher star formation rates in all analysed morphological types. Therefore, our results suggest that interactions and mergers obtained in the high fraction of FIR AGN contribute significantly to high star formation rates observed in the selected sample, but are not the only mechanism responsible for enhancing star formation, and others such as AGN positive feedback could contribute as well. In future we will study in more details the possibility of AGN positive feedback through the spectroscopic analysis of public and our SALT data.",2019,[],5
1902.00437,astro-ph,"We study the formation of the 9:7 mean motion resonance in a system of two low-mass planets (equation) embedded in a gaseous protoplanetary disk employing a full 2D hydrodynamic treatment of the disk-planet interactions. Our aim is to determine the disk properties that favor a capture of two equal-mass super-Earths into this second-order resonance. For this purpose, we have performed a series of numerical hydrodynamic simulations of the system of two super-Earths migrating in disks with a variety of different initial parameters and found conditions for the permanent or temporary locking in the 9:7 resonance. We observe that capture occurs during the convergent migration of planets if their resonance angle at the moment of arrival at the resonance assumes values in a certain range (inside a window of capture). The width of such a window depends on the relative migration and circularization rates that are determined by the disk parameters. The window is wide if the relative migration rate is slow, and it becomes narrower as the relative migration rate increases. The window will be closed if the migration rate is sufficiently high, and the capture will not take place. We illustrate also how the 9:7 resonance window of capture is affected by the initial eccentricities and the initial orbits of the planets.",2019,[],5
1903.06130,astro-ph,"We aim to explore two exozodiacal dust production mechanisms, first re-investigating the Poynting-Robertson drag pile-up scenario, and then elaborating on the less explored, but promising exocometary dust delivery scenario. We developped a new versatile, numerical model that calculates the dust dynamics, with non orbit-averaged equations for the grains close to the star. The model includes dust sublimation and incorporates a radiative transfer code for direct comparison to the observations. We consider in this study four stellar types, three dust compositions, and we assume a parent belt at 50 au. We find that, in the case of the Poynting-Robertson drag pile-up scenario, it is impossible to produce long-lived submicron-sized grains close to the star. The inward drifting grains fill in the region between the parent belt and the sublimation distance, producing an unrealistically strong mid-infrared excess compared to the near-infrared excess. The dust pile-up at the sublimation radius is by far insufficient to boost the near-IR flux of the exozodi to the point where it dominates over the mid-infrared excess. In the case of the exocometary dust delivery scenario, we find that a narrow ring can form close to the sublimation zone, populated with large grains several tens to several hundred of micrometers in radius. Although not perfect, this scenario provides a better match to the observations, especially if the grains are carbon-rich. We also find that the required number of active exocomets to sustain the observed dust level is reasonable. We conclude that the hot exozodiacal dust detected by near-infrared interferometry is unlikely to result from inwards grains migration by Poynting-Robertson drag from a distant parent belt, but could instead have an exocometary origin.

1909.07165,astro-ph,"Context. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-long bursts uniquely detected at radio frequencies. FRB 131104 is the only case for which a equation-ray transient positionally and temporally consistent was claimed. This high-energy transient had a duration of equation~s and a 15-150~keV fluence equation erg equation. However, the association with the FRB is still debated. Aims. We aim at testing the systematic presence of an associated transient high-energy counterpart throughout a sample of the FRB population. Methods. We used an approach like that used in machine learning methodologies to accurately model the highly-variable Fermi/GBM instrumental background on a time interval comparable to the duration of the proposed equation-ray counterpart of FRB 131104. A possible equation-ray signal is then constrained considering sample average lightcurves. Results. We constrain the fluence of the possible equation-ray signal in the 8-1000 keV band down to equation (equation) erg cmequation for a 200-s (1-s) integration time. Furthermore, we found the radio-to-gamma fluence ratio to be equation Jy ms ergequation cmequation. Conclusions. Our fluence limits exclude equation of Fermi/GBM detected long gamma-ray bursts and equation of Fermi/GBM detected short gamma-ray bursts. In addition, our limits on the radio-to-gamma fluence ratio point to a different emission mechanism from that of magnetar giant flares. Finally, we exclude a equation-ray counterpart as fluent as the one possibly associated with FRB 131104 to be a common feature of FRBs.",2019,[],5
1905.00800,astro-ph,"Molecular oxygen has been the subject of many observational searches as chemical models predicted it to be a reservoir of oxygen. Although it has been detected in two regions of the interstellar medium, its rarity is a challenge for astrochemical models. In this paper, we have combined the physical conditions computed with smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations with our full gas-grain chemical model Nautilus, to study the predicted O2 abundance in interstellar material forming cold cores. We thus follow the chemical evolution of gas and ices in parcels of material from the diffuse interstellar conditions to the cold dense cores. Most of our predicted O2 abundances are below 1e-8 (with respect to the total proton density) and the predicted column densities in simulated cold cores is at maximum a few 1e14 cm-2, in agreement with the non detection limits. This low O2 abundance can be explained by the fact that, in a large fraction of the interstellar material, the atomic oxygen is depleted onto the grain surface (and hydrogenated to form H2O) before O2 can be formed in the gas-phase and protected from UV photo-dissociations. We could achieve this result only because we took into account the full history of the evolution of the physical conditions from the diffuse medium to the cold cores.",2019,[],5

During a stunted outburst, the primary eclipse is found to increase in depth but the residual brightness at mid-primary-eclipse remains nearly constant. By contrast, the secondary eclipse retains the same depth but the brightness at mid-secondary eclipse increases during outburst, following the orbital variations of the out-of-eclipse light. The eclipse ephemeris is statistically consistent with historical ephemerides and shows only marginal evidence for a period change.

1906.04208,astro-ph,"Observational cosmology has become an important laboratory for testing General Relativity, with searches for modified gravity forming a significant portion of the science case for existing and future surveys. In this paper, we illustrate how future measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies can be combined with large galaxy surveys to improve constraints on modified gravity using the technique of Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ) tomography. SZ tomography uses the correlations between the kinetic/polarized SZ contributions to the small-angular scale CMB and the distribution of structure measured in a galaxy redshift survey to reconstruct the remote dipole and quadrupole fields, e.g. the CMB dipole and quadrupole observed throughout the Universe. We compute the effect of a class of modifications of gravity on the remote dipole and quadrupole fields, illustrating that these observables combine a number of the desirable features of existing probes. We then perform a fisher forecast of constraints on a two-parameter class of modifications of gravity for next-generation CMB experiments and galaxy surveys. By incorporating information from the reconstructed remote dipole and quadrupole fields, we find that it is possible to improve the constraints on this model by a factor of equation beyond what is possible with a galaxy survey alone. We conclude that SZ tomography is a promising method for testing gravity with future cosmological datasets.",2019,[],5

In addition, we will be able to directly observe the effects of X-ray irradiation on circumstellar grain growth to compare with grain evolution models in both high- and low-UV environments. X-rays are native to stars at all phases of star formation and affect planet-forming disks especially through flares. Moreover, X-rays trace magnetic fields which weave through the flares, providing a unique, non-gravitational feedback mechanism between disk and star.

All of these were found either with the box least-squares algorithm or by visual inspection. Here we use our new transit least-squares (TLS) algorithm to search for additional planets around all K2 stars that are currently known to host at least one planet. We discover and statistically validate 17 new planets with radii ranging from about 0.7 Earth radii to roughly 2.2 Earth radii and a median radius of 1.18 Earth radii. EPIC201497682.03, with a radius of 0.692 (-0.048, 0.059) Earth radii, is the second smallest planet ever discovered with K2. The transit signatures of these 17 planets are typically 200 ppm deep (ranging from 100 ppm to 2000 ppm), and their orbital periods extend from about 0.7 d to 34 d with a median value of about 4 d. Fourteen of these 17 systems only had one known planet before, and they now join the growing number of multi-planet systems. Most stars in our sample have subsolar masses and radii. The small planetary radii in our sample are a direct result of the higher signal detection efficiency that TLS has compared to box-fitting algorithms in the shallow-transit regime.

1902.01830,astro-ph,"Cosmological information from forthcoming galaxy surveys, such as LSST and Euclid, will soon exceed that available from the CMB. Higher order correlation functions, like the bispectrum, will be indispensable for realising this potential. The interpretation of this data faces many challenges because gravitational collapse of matter is a complex non-linear process, typically modelled by computationally expensive N-body simulations. Proposed alternatives using fast dark matter codes (e.g. 2LPT or particle-mesh) are primarily evaluated on their ability to reproduce clustering statistics linked to the matter power spectrum. The accuracy of these codes can be tested in more detail by looking at higher-order statistics, and in this paper we will present an efficient and optimal methodology (MODAL-LSS) to reconstruct the full bispectrum of any 3D density field. We make quantitative comparisons between a number of fast dark matter codes and Gadget at redshift equation. This will serve as an important diagnostic tool for dark matter/halo mock catalogues and lays the foundation for realistic high precision analysis with the galaxy bispectrum. In particular, we show that the lack of small-scale power in the bispectrum of fast codes can be ameliorated by a simple `boosting' technique for the power spectrum. We also investigate the covariance of the MODAL-LSS bispectrum estimator, demonstrating the plateauing of non-Gaussian errors in contrast to simple Gaussian extrapolations.

The collisional-triple SN Ia progenitor model posits that SNe Ia result from head-on collisions of binary white dwarfs (WDs), driven by dynamical perturbations by the tertiary stars in mild-hierarchical triple systems. To reproduce the Galactic SN Ia rate, at least ~30-55 per cent of all WDs would need to be in triple systems of a specific architecture. We test this scenario by searching the Gaia DR2 database for the postulated progenitor triples. Within a volume out to 120 pc, we search around Gaia-resolved double WDs with projected separations up to 300 au, for physical tertiary companions at projected separations out to 9000 au. At 120 pc, Gaia can detect faint low-mass tertiaries down to the bottom of the main sequence and to the coolest WDs. Around 27 double WDs, we identify zero tertiaries at such separations, setting a 95 per cent confidence upper limit of 11 per cent on the fraction of binary WDs that are part of mild hierarchical triples of the kind required by the model.

However, co-natal stars should be present throughout the Galaxy, and their demographics can shed light on the clustered nature of star formation and the dynamical state of the disk. In previous work we presented a set of simulations of the Galactic disk that followed the clustered formation and dynamical evolution of 4 billion individual stars over the last 5 Gyr. The simulations predict that a high fraction of co-moving stars with physical and 3D velocity separation of equation pc and equation km sequation are co-natal.

We find that the distribution of relative velocities and separations of pairs in the data is in good agreement with the predictions from the simulation. We identify 111 co-moving pairs in the Solar neighborhood with reliable astrometric and spectroscopic measurements. These pairs show a strong preference for having similar metallicities when compared to random field pairs. We therefore conclude that these pairs were very likely born together.

Model spectra of the emission from a neutron star were calculated using the atmosphere code ATM24. In the next step, those models were fitted to a simulated spectra of the neutron star calculated for ATHENA's WFI detector, using the satellite calibration files. To simulate the spectra we assumed three different values of effective temperatures, surface gravities and gravitational redshifts. There cases are related to the three different neutron star masses and radii. This analysis allows us to demonstrate the precision of our method and demonstrate the need for a fast detector onboard of ATHENA. A large grid of theoretical spectra was calculated with various parameters and a hydrogen-helium-iron composition of solar proportion. These spectra were fitted to the simulated spectrum to estimate the precision of mass and radius determination. In each case, we obtained very precise mass and radius values with errors in the range 3--10% for mass and in the range 2--8% for radius within the 1-sigma confidence error. We show here that with the ATHENA WFI detector, such a determination could be used to constrain the equation of state of superdense neutron star matter.",2019,[],5
1905.11298,astro-ph,"Three of the seven rocky planets (e, f, and g) in TRAPPIST-1 system orbit in the habitable zone of the host star. Therefore, water can be in liquid state at their surface being essential for life. Recent studies suggest that these planets formed beyond the snow line in a water-rich region. The initial water reservoir can be lost during the planet formation due to the stellar activity of the infant low-mass star. However, a potential subsequent water delivery event, like the late heavy bombardment (LHB) in the Solar System, can replenish planetary water reservoirs. To study this water delivery process, we set up a simple model in which an additional 5 MEarth--50 MEarth planet is embedded in a water-rich asteroid belt beyond the snow line of TRAPPIST-1. Asteroids perturbed out from the chaotic zone of the putative planet can enter into the inner system and accreted by the known planets. Our main finding is that the larger is the orbital distance of planet, the higher is the amount of water delivered to the planet by an LHB-like event.",2019,[],5
1901.10785,astro-ph,"Observations show that transverse magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and flows are often simultaneously present in magnetic loops of the solar corona. The waves are resonantly damped in the Alfv\'en continuum because of plasma and/or magnetic field nonuniformity across the loop. The resonant damping is relevant in the context of coronal heating, since it provides a mechanism to cascade energy down to the dissipative scales. It has been theoretically shown that the presence of flow affects the waves propagation and damping, but most of the studies rely on the unjustified assumption that the transverse nonuniformity is confined to a boundary layer much thinner than the radius of the loop. Here we present a semi-analytic technique to explore the effect of flow on resonant MHD waves in coronal flux tubes with thick nonuniform boundaries. We extend a published method, which was originally developed for a static plasma, in order to incorporate the effect of flow. We allowed the flow velocity to continuously vary within the nonuniform boundary from the internal velocity to the external velocity. The analytic part of the method is based on expressing the wave perturbations in the thick nonuniform boundary of the loop as a Frobenius series that contains a singular term accounting for the Alfv\'en resonance, while the numerical part of the method consists of solving iteratively the transcendental dispersion relation together with the equation for the Alfv\'en resonance position. As an application of this method, we investigated the impact of flow on the phase velocity and resonant damping length of MHD kink waves. We consistently recover results in the thin boundary approximation obtained in previous studies. We have extended those results to the case of thick boundaries. We also explored the error associated with the use of the thin boundary approximation beyond its regime of applicability.",2019,[],5
1909.03079,astro-ph,"It is well known that the polarized continuum emission from magnetically aligned dust grains is determined to a large extent by local magnetic field structure. However, the observed significant anticorrelation between polarization fraction and column density may be strongly affected, perhaps even dominated by variations in grain alignment efficiency with local conditions, in contrast to standard assumptions of a spatially homogeneous grain alignment efficiency. Here we introduce a generic way to incorporate heterogeneous grain alignment into synthetic polarization observations of molecular clouds, through a simple model where the grain alignment efficiency depends on the local gas density as a power-law. We justify the model using results derived from radiative torque alignment theory. The effects of power-law heterogeneous alignment models on synthetic observations of simulated molecular clouds are presented. We find that the polarization fraction-column density correlation can be brought into agreement with observationally determined values through heterogeneous alignment, though there remains degeneracy with the relative strength of cloud-scale magnetized turbulence and the mean magnetic field orientation relative to the observer. We also find that the dispersion in polarization angles-polarization fraction correlation remains robustly correlated despite the simultaneous changes to both observables in the presence of heterogeneous alignment.",2019,[],5

We find a strong correlation between the line widths of the UV and optical \FeII\ emission lines, indicating that both \FeII\ emission features arise from similar distances in the broad line region (BLR). However, in detail we find differing trends, depending on the width of \FeII. While the velocity shifts and dispersions of the UV Fe II (\FeUV) and optical Fe II (\FeOPT) emission lines are comparable to each other for AGNs with relatively narrow \FeOPT\ line widths (i.e., FWHM < 3200 \kms; Group A), \FeOPT\ is broader than \FeUV\ for AGNs with relatively broad \FeOPT\ (i.e., FWHM > 3200 \kms; Group B). \FeII\ emission lines are on average narrower than \Hb\ and \MgII\ for Group A, indicating the \FeII\ emission region is further out in the BLR, while for Group B AGNs \FeOPT\ is comparable to \Hb\ and broader than \MgII. While \FeII\ emission lines are on average redshifted (equation \kms\ and equation, respectively for \FeUV\ and \FeOPT), indicating inflow, the sample as a whole shows a large range of velocity shifts, suggesting complex nature of gas kinematics.",2019,[],5
1908.01018,astro-ph,"L1521F is found to be forming multiple cores and it is cited as an example of the densest core with an embedded VeLLO in a highly dynamical environment. We present the core-scale magnetic fields (B-fields) in the near vicinity of the VeLLO L1521F-IRS using submm polarization measurements at 850equationm using JCMT POL-2. This is the first attempt to use high-sensitivity observations to map the sub-parsec scale B-fields in a core with a VeLLO. The B-fields are ordered and very well connected to the parsec-scale field geometry seen in our earlier optical polarization observations and the large-scale structure seen in Planck dust polarization. The core scale B-field strength estimated using Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi relation is equationG which is more than ten times of the value we obtained in the envelope (envelope in this paper is ""core envelope""). This indicates that B-fields are getting stronger on smaller scales. The magnetic energies are found to be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than non-thermal kinetic energies in the envelope and core. This suggests that magnetic fields are more important than turbulence in the energy budget of L1521F. The mass-to-flux ratio of 2.3equation0.7 suggests that the core is magnetically-supercritical. The degree of polarization is steadily decreasing towards the denser part of the core with a power law slope of -0.86.",2019,[],5
1907.03806,astro-ph,"In the framework of the hierarchical model the intra-cluster medium properties of galaxy clusters are tightly linked to structure formation, which makes X-ray surveys well suited for cosmological studies. To constrain cosmological parameters accurately by use of galaxy clusters in X-ray surveys, a better understanding of selection effects related to the detection method is needed. We aim at a better understanding of galaxy cluster morphologies to include corrections between the different core types and covariances with X-ray luminosities in selection functions. We stress the morphological deviations between a newly described surface brightness (SB) profile characterization and a commonly used single equation-model. We investigate a novel approach to describe SB profiles, where the excess cool-core emission in the galaxy cluster centres is modelled using wavelet decomposition. Morphological parameters and the residuals are compared to classical single equation-models. Using single equation-models to describe the ensemble of overall SB profiles leads on average to a non-zero bias (equation) in the outer part of the clusters, i.e. a equation systematic difference in the SB at large radii. In addition equation-models show a general trend towards underestimating the flux in the outskirts for smaller core radii. Fixing the equation parameter to equation doubles the bias and increases the residuals from a single equation-model up to more than equation. Modelling the core region in the fitting procedure reduces the impact of these two effects significantly. We find a positive scaling between shape parameters and temperature, as well as a negative correlation (equation) between extent and luminosity. Our non-parametric analysis of the self-similar scaled emission measure profiles indicates no systematic core-type differences of median profiles in the galaxy clusters outskirts.",2019,[],5
1906.10759,astro-ph,"The star formation main sequence (SFMS) is a tight relation between the galaxy star formation rate (SFR) and its total stellar mass (equation). Early-type galaxies (ETGs) are often considered as low-SFR outliers of this relation. We study, for the first time, the separated distribution in the SFR vs. equation of bulges and discs of 49 ETGs from the CALIFA survey. This is achieved using C2D, a new code to perform spectro-photometric decompositions of integral field spectroscopy datacubes. Our results reflect that: i) star formation always occurs in the disc component and not in bulges; ii) star-forming discs in our ETGs are compatible with the SFMS defined by star forming galaxies at equation; iii) the star formation is not confined to the outskirts of discs, but it is present at all radii (even where the bulge dominates the light); iv) for a given mass, bulges exhibit lower sSFR than discs at all radii; and v) we do not find a deficit of molecular gas in bulges with respect to discs for a given mass in our ETGs.

1908.03413,astro-ph,"We analyze 9 years of PASS 8 equation-LAT data in the 60equation500 MeV range and determine flux upper limits (UL) for 17 gamma-ray dark pulsars as a probe of axions produced by nucleon-nucleon Bremsstrahlung in the pulsar core. Using a previously published axion decay gamma-ray photon flux model for pulsars which relies on a high core temperature of 20 MeV, we improve the determination of the UL axion mass (equation), at 95 percent confidence level, to 9.6 equation 10equation eV, which is a factor of 8 improvement on previous results. We show that the axion emissivity (energy loss rate per volume) at realistic lower pulsar core temperatures of 4 MeV or less is reduced to such an extent that axion emissivity and the gamma-ray signal becomes negligible. We consider an alternative emission model based on energy loss rate per mass to allow equation to be constrained with equation-LAT observations. This model yields a plausible UL equation of 10equation eV for pulsar core temperature equation 0.1 MeV but knowledge of the extent of axion to photon conversion in the pulsar equation field would be required to make a precise UL axion mass determination. The peak of axion flux is likely to produce gamma-rays in the equation 1 MeV energy range and so future observations with medium energy gamma-ray missions, such as AMEGO and e-ASTROGAM, will be vital to further constrain UL equation.",2019,[],5
1906.10142,astro-ph,"We combine sophisticated high precision scattering experiments, together with results from the Millenium-II simulation, to compute the cosmic merger rate of bound compact object (CO) binaries dynamically interacting with supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). We consider binaries composed of white dwarfs (WDs), neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). The overall merger rates for WD-WD, NS-NS, BH-BH, BH-NS binaries and EBBH (eccentric binaries of black holes) from redshift equation are found to be equation(equation for Type Ia SNe), equation, equation, equation and equation , respectively, for a nominal CO binary fraction in the Galactic centre of 0.1. We calculate the distance (equation) distribution of the merger sites with respect to the host galaxies of the binaries. The distribution shows a wide range of distances up to equationMpc; this tail is produced by escaped hyper-velocity CO binaries. Due to the differences in the matter density of the surrounding environment, merger events with different equation are expected to display significantly different signatures in their EM counterparts. In particular, merger events (and especially NS-NS) producing a relativistic jet but occurring in the intergalactic medium will have very weak afterglow radiation relative to their prompt emission. These events, which we call 'off-center', can only be produced from a close encounter between CO binaries and SMBHBs; hence the detection of such merger events would indicate the existence of nearby SMBHBs, and in particular with high mass ratio, produced in the aftermath of a major galaxy merger.",2019,[],5
1905.02468,astro-ph,"In this paper we present new optical observations of the galaxy NGC 185 intended to reveal the status of supernova remnants (SNRs) in this dwarf companion of the Andromeda galaxy. Previously, it was reported that this galaxy hosts one SNR. Our deep photometric study with the 2m telescope at Rozhen National Astronomical Observatory using narrow-band Hequation and [SII] filters revealed complex structure of the interstellar medium in the center of the galaxy. To confirm the classification and to study the kinematics of the detected nebulae, we carried out spectroscopic observations using the SCORPIO multi-mode spectrograph at the 6m telescope at the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Science, both in low- and high-resolution modes. We also searched the archival X-ray and radio data for counterparts of the candidate SNRs identified by our optical observations. Our observations imply the presence of one more SNR, one possible HII region previously cataloged as part of an SNR, and the presence of an additional source of shock ionization in one low-brightness PN. We detected enhanced [SII]/Halpha and [NII]/Halpha line ratios, as well as relatively high (up to 90 km sequation) expansion velocities of the two observed nebulae, motivating their classification as SNRs (with diameters of 45 pc and 50 pc), confirmed by both photometric and spectral observations. The estimated electron density of emission nebulae is 30 - 200 cmequation.

1909.02248,astro-ph,"Blazhko stars from the extended equation time series of RRab stars in the globular cluster, M3, are analysed. This is the largest sample of Blazhko stars with full details of their Blazhko properties in a homogeneous stellar system. Blazhko periods and light-curve solutions are determined/estimated for 83 fundamental-mode variables. The lack of phase modulation in Oosterhoff-type~II stars and the diminishing relative strength of the modulation in long-period Oosterhoff-type~I stars are the regular tendencies found between the pulsation and modulation properties of Blazko stars. Similarly to previous results, no modulation of the longest-period stars is detected. The onset of the modulation in a previously regular RRab star, and the similar distribution of modulated and non-modulated stars imply that the modulation is a temporal property of RRL stars, which may occur at any time in any RRab star except the coolest ones. Comparing the modulation periods in M3 and in other samples of Blazhko stars, the mean logequation value is found to depend on the metallicity of the system. The separation of the temperature- and radius-change induced variations supports our previous finding that the photometric radius variation does not show any modulation. The pulsation-averaged mean brightness and temperature of Blazhko stars are found to be larger in the large-amplitude phase of the modulation than in the small-amplitude phase. The larger the amplitude of the modulation, the larger changes of the mean parameters are detected.",2019,[],5
1903.00749,astro-ph,"The Juno Orbiter is measuring the three-dimensional gravity field perturbation of Jupiter induced by its rapid rotation, zonal flows, and tidal response to its major natural satellites. This paper aims to provide the contributions to the tesseral harmonics coefficients Cnm, Snm, and the Love numbers knm to be expected from static tidal response in the gravity field of rotating Jupiter. For that purpose, we apply the method of Concentric Maclaurin Ellipsoids (CMS). As we are interested in the variation of the tidal potential with the longitudes of the moons, we take into account the simultaneous presence of the satellites Io, Europa, and Ganymede. We assume co-planar, circular orbits with normals parallel to Jupiter's spin axis. The planet-centered longitude of Io in the three-moon case is arbitrarily assumed varphi = 0. Under these assumptions we find maximum amplitudes and fluctuations of 3.5 times 10-8 - 15% for C22. For the Love numbers, largest variation of 10% to 20% is seen in k42 and k62, whereas the values k2, k33, and k44 fall into narrow ranges of 0.1% uncertainty or less. In particular, we find k2=k2,Io(1 - 0.02%) where k2,Io=0.5897 is the static tidal response to lone Io. Our obtained gravity field perturbation leads to a maximum equatorial shape deformation of up to 28m. We suggest that should Juno measurements of the knm deviate from those values, it may be due to dynamic or dissipative effects on Jupiter's tidal response. Finally, an analytic expression is provided to calculate the tesseral harmonics contribution from static tidal response for any configuration of the satellites.",2019,[],5
1912.07874,astro-ph,"The isotopes equationFe and equationAl originate from massive stars and their supernovae, reflecting ongoing nucleosynthesis in the Galaxy. We studied the gamma-ray emission from these isotopes at characteristic energies 1173, 1332, and 1809 keV with over 15 years of SPI data, finding a line flux in equationFe combined lines of equation ph cmequation sequation and the equationAl line flux of equation ph cmequation sequation above the background and continuum emission for the whole sky. Based on the exponential-disk grid maps, we characterise the emission extent of equationAl to find scale parameters equation kpc and equation kpc, however the equationFe lines are too weak to spatially constrain the emission. Based on a point source model test across the Galactic plane, the equationFe emission would not be consistent with a single strong point source in the Galactic center or somewhere else, providing a hint for a diffuse nature. We carried out comparisons of emission morphology maps using different candidate-source tracers for both equationAl and equationFe emissions, and suggests that the equationFe emission is more likely to be concentrated towards the Galactic plane. We determine the equationFe/equationAl equation-ray flux ratio at equation , when using a parameterized spatial morphology model. Across the range of plausible morphologies, it appears possible that equationAl and equationFe are distributed differently in the Galaxy. Using the best fitting maps for each of the elements, we constrain flux ratios in the range 0.2--0.4. We discuss its implications for massive star models and their nucleosynthesis.",2019,[],5
1911.05717,astro-ph,"Optimal analyses of many signals in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) require map-level extraction of individual components in the microwave sky, rather than measurements at the power spectrum level alone. To date, nearly all map-level component separation in CMB analyses has been performed exclusively using satellite data. In this paper, we implement a component separation method based on the internal linear combination (ILC) approach which we have designed to optimally account for the anisotropic noise (in the 2D Fourier domain) often found in ground-based CMB experiments. Using this method, we combine multi-frequency data from the Planck satellite and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarimeter (ACTPol) to construct the first wide-area, arcminute-resolution component-separated maps (covering approximately 2100 sq. deg.) of the CMB temperature anisotropy and the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect sourced by the inverse-Compton scattering of CMB photons off hot, ionized gas. Our ILC pipeline allows for explicit deprojection of various contaminating signals, including a modified blackbody approximation of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) spectral energy distribution. The cleaned CMB maps will be a useful resource for CMB lensing reconstruction, kinematic SZ cross-correlations, and primordial non-Gaussianity studies. The tSZ maps will be used to study the pressure profiles of galaxies, groups, and clusters through cross-correlations with halo catalogs, with dust contamination controlled via CIB deprojection.

1908.03663,astro-ph,"Measurements of the Hubble constant, and more generally measurements of the expansion rate and distances over the interval equation, appear to be inconsistent with the predictions of the standard cosmological model (equationCDM) given observations of cosmic microwave background temperature and polarization anisotropies. Here we consider a variety of types of departures from equationCDM that could, in principle, restore concordance among these datasets, and we explain why we find almost all of them unlikely to be successful. We single out the set of solutions that increase the expansion rate in the decade of scale factor expansion just prior to recombination as the least unlikely. These solutions are themselves tightly constrained by their impact on photon diffusion and on the gravitational driving of acoustic oscillations of the modes that begin oscillating during this epoch -- modes that project on to angular scales that are very well measured. We point out that a general feature of such solutions is a residual to fits to equationCDM, like the one observed in Planck power spectra. This residual drives the modestly significant inferences of angular-scale dependence to the matter density and anomalously high lensing power, puzzling aspects of a data set that is otherwise extremely well fit by equationCDM.",2019,[],5

In this study, we investigate its radio structures using archival data obtained using the Karl G.~Jansky very large array (VLA) and the very long baseline array (VLBA). The new VLA images reveal an outermost radio emission separated by 9.1 arcsec. Its resolved structure and steep spectrum suggest a terminal shock in a radio lobe energized by the jet from the PMN J09480022 nucleus. This large-scale radio component is found at almost the same position angle as that of the pc-scale jet, indicating a stable jet direction up to ~1 Mpc. Its apparent one-sidedness implies a moderate advancing speed (equation). The kinematic age of 1 x 107 year of the jet activity is consistent with the expected NLS1 phase of ~107 year in the AGN lifetime. The VLBA image reveals the jet structure at distances ranging from r=0.82 milliarcsec to 3.5 milliarcsec, corresponding to approximately 100 pc, where superluminal motions were found. The jet width profile (equation) and flux-density profile (equation) depending on the distance equation along the jet suggest that the jet kinetic energy is converted into internal energy in this region.

1903.08665,astro-ph,"We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the unusual Type Ia supernova ASASSN-18tb, including a series of SALT spectra obtained over the course of nearly six months and the first observations of a supernova by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We confirm a previous observation by Kollmeier et al. (2019) showing that ASASSN-18tb is the first relatively normal Type Ia supernova to exhibit clear broad (equation km sequation) Hequation emission in its nebular phase spectra. We find that this event is best explained as a sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosion with equation. Despite the strong Hequation signature at late times, we find that the early rise of the supernova shows no evidence for deviations from a single-component power-law and is best fit with a moderately shallow power-law of index equation. We find that the Hequation luminosity remains approximately constant after its initial detection at phase 37 d, and that the Hequation velocity evolution does not trace that of the Fe~IIIequation emission. These suggest that the Hequation emission arises from circumstellar medium (CSM) rather than swept up material from a non-degenerate companion. However, ASASSN-18tb is strikingly different from other known CSM-interacting Type Ia supernovae in a number of significant ways. Those objects typically show an Hequation luminosity two orders of magnitude higher than what is seen in ASASSN-18tb, pushing them away from the empirical light-curve relations that define ""normal"" Type Ia supernovae. Conversely, ASASSN-18tb exhibits a fairly typical light curve and luminosity for an underluminous or transitional SN Ia, with equation mag. Moreover, ASASSN-18tb is the only SN Ia showing Hequation from CSM interaction to be discovered in an early-type galaxy.",2019,[],5

1907.07708,astro-ph,"Extragalactic peaked-spectrum radio sources are thought to be the progenitors of larger, radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN). Synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) has often been identified as the cause of their spectral peak. The identification of new megahertz-peaked spectrum sources from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey provides an opportunity to test how radio sources with spectral peaks below 1 GHz fit within this evolutionary picture. We observed six peaked-spectrum sources selected from the GLEAM survey, three that have spectral characteristics which violate SSA and three that have spectral peaks below 230 MHz, with the Very Long Baseline Array at 1.55 and 4.96 GHz. We present milliarcsecond resolution images of each source and constrain their morphology, linear size, luminosity, and magnetic field strength. Of the sources that are resolved by our study, the sources that violate SSA appear to be compact doubles, while the sources with peak frequencies below 230 MHz have core-jet features. We find that all of our sources are smaller than expected from SSA by factors of >20. We also find that component magnetic field strengths calculated from SSA are likely inaccurate, differing by factors of >5 from equipartition estimates. The calculated equipartition magnetic field strengths more closely resemble estimates from previously studied gigahertz-peaked spectrum sources. Exploring a model of the interaction between jets and the interstellar medium, we demonstrate that free-free absorption (FFA) can accurately describe the linear sizes and peak frequencies of our sources. Our findings support the theory that there is a fraction of peaked-spectrum sources whose spectral peaks are best modelled by FFA, implying our understanding of the early stages of radio AGN is incomplete.",2019,[],5

After extensive tests that characterise several intrinsic and numerical aspects of the simulations, we describe some applications used for current and future time domain surveys and for the study of extremely variable sources (e.g., ""changing look"" or flaring AGN). Specifically, we define a simulation setup which reproduces the AGN variability observed in the PTF/iPTF survey, and use it to forward model longer light curves of the kind that may be observed within the LSST main survey. Thanks to our effcient implementations, these simulations are able to cover for example over 1 Myr with a roughly weekly cadence.

Although this is a very idealized situation, the resulting model preserves the phenomenology of Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and, in some situations, can be described as a perfect fluid, without introducing large errors in both cosmological background and first-order perturbations. The perfect fluid description of RRG model was already used to study the warmness of dark matter, massive neutrinos and interaction of baryons and photons before recombination, showing very good agreement with previous works based on the full Einstein-Boltzmann system of equations. In order to understand these results and construct a more general and formal framework for RRG, we develop a theoretical description of first-order cosmological perturbations of RRG, based on a distribution function which encodes the simplifying assumption that all particles have the same momentum magnitude. The full set of Einstein-Boltzmann equations for RRG distribution are derived and quantities beyond the perfect fluid approximation are studied. Using RRG to describe warm dark matter, we show that, for particles with equation, the perfect fluid approximation is valid on scales equation, for most of the universe evolution. We also determine initial conditions for RRG in the early universe and study the evolution of potential in a toy model of universe composed only by RRG.",2019,[],5
1911.04891,astro-ph,"In this paper we study the universality of the results of SQUEzE, a software package to classify quasar spectra and estimate their redshifts. The code is presented in \citePerez-Rafols2019. We test the results against changes on signal-to-noise, spectral resolution, wavelength coverage, and quasar brightness. We find that SQUEzE levels of performance (quantified with purity and completeness) are stable to spectra that have a noise dispersion 4 times that of our standard test sample, BOSS. We also find that the performance remains unchanged if pixels of width 25\AA are considered, and decreases by equation for pixels of width 100\AA. We see no effect when analyzing subsets of different quasar brightness, and we establish that the blue part (up to 7000\AA) of the spectra is sufficient for the classification. Finally, we compare our suite of tests with samples of spectra expected from WEAVE-QSO and DESI, and narrow-band imaging from J-PAS. We conclude that SQUEzE will perform similarly when confronted with the demands of these future surveys as when applied to current BOSS (and eBOSS) data.   \it Keywords: cosmology: observations - quasar: emission lines - quasar: absorption lines",2019,[],5
1903.06163,astro-ph,"We present a novel X-ray assembly of functionally related instrument blocks intended to measure solar flare and active region (AR) spectra from within the Russian instrument complex KORTES, to be mounted aboard the International Space Station (ISS). SolpeX consists of three blocks: fast-rotating multiple flat crystal Bragg spectrometer, pin-hole X-ray spectral imager and Bragg polarimeter. This combination of measuring blocks will offer an opportunity to detect/measure possible X-ray polarization in soft X-ray emission lines/continuum and record spectra of solar flares, in particular during their impulsive phases. Polarized Bremsstrahlung and line emission may arise from presence of directed particle beams colliding with denser regions of flares. As a result of evaporation, the X-ray spectral-components are expected to be Doppler shifted, which will also be measured.   In this paper, we present details of the construction of three SolpeX blocks and discuss their functionality. Delivery of KORTES with SolpeX to ISS is expected in 2020/2021.",2019,[],5
1911.04793,astro-ph,"We performed observations of the Sco-Cen F star HD 117214 aiming at a search for planetary companions and the characterization of the debris disk structure. HD 117214 was observed with the SPHERE subsystems IRDIS, IFS and ZIMPOL at optical and near-IR wavelengths using angular and polarimetric differential imaging techniques. This provided the first images of scattered light from the debris disk with a spatial resolution reaching 25 mas and an inner working angle equation. With the observations with IRDIS and IFS we derive detection limits for substellar companions. The geometrical parameters of the detected disk are constrained by fitting 3D models for the scattering of an optically thin dust disk. Investigating the possible origin of the disk gap, we introduced putative planets therein and modeled the planet-disk and planet-planet dynamical interactions. The obtained planetary architectures are compared with the detection limit curves. The debris disk has an axisymmetric ring structure with a radius of equation or equation au and an inclination of equation and exhibits a equation (equation au) wide inner cavity. From the polarimetric data, we derive a polarized flux contrast for the disk of equation in the RI band. The fractional scattered polarized flux of the disk is eight times smaller than the fractional infrared flux excess. This ratio is similar to the one obtained for the debris disk HIP 79977 indicating that dust radiation properties are not very different between these two disks. Inside the disk cavity we achieve the high sensitivity limits on planetary companions with a mass down to equation at projected radial separations between equation and equation. We can exclude the stellar companions at a radial separation larger than 75 mas from the star.",2019,[],5
1910.05994,astro-ph,"We study the parameter estimation bias induced by intrinsic alignments on a Euclid-like weak lensing survey. For the intrinsic alignment signal we assume a composite alignment model for elliptical and spiral galaxies using tidal shearing and tidal torquing as the alignment generating mechanism, respectively. The parameter estimation bias is carried out analytically with a Gaussian bias model and through running Monte-Carlo-Markov-chains on synthetic data including the alignment signal with a likelihood only including the cosmic shear signal. In particular, we study the impact of equation and equation alignment terms individually as well as the more realistic situation where both types of alignment are present, and investigate the scaling of the estimation biases with varying strength of the alignment signal. Our results show that intrinsic alignments can cause substantial biases in cosmological parameters even if the coupling of galaxies to the ambient large is small. Especially equation-contributions strongly bias key cosmological parameters such as the dark energy equation of state. We also correct the analytic expression for the Gaussian bias model and find that the biases induced by intrinsic alignments are not accurately recovered by the simple analytic model.",2019,[],5

We also present a computational implementation of this model, which is developed as a new plug-in of Stellarium, a free and open-source planetarium software.

1901.05644,astro-ph,"We study tidal disruption events of rotating stars by a supermassive black hole in a galactic nucleus by using a smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code. We compare mass infall rates of tidal-disruption debris of a non-rotating and of a rotating star when they come close to the supermassive black hole. Remarkably the mass distribution of debris bound to the black hole as a function of specific energy shows clear difference between rotating and non-rotating stars, even if the stellar rotation is far from the break-up limit. The debris of a star whose initial spin is parallel to the orbital angular momentum has a mass distribution which extends to lower energy than that of non-rotating star. The debris of a star with anti-parallel spin has a larger energy compared with a non-rotating counterpart. As a result, debris from a star with anti-parallel spin is bound more loosely to the black hole and the mass-infall rate rises later in time, while that of a star with a parallel spin is tightly bound and falls back to the black hole earlier. The different rising timescales of mass-infall rate may affect the early phase of flares due to the tidal disruptions.   In the Appendix we study the disruptions by using a uniform-density ellipsoid model which approximately takes into account the effect of strong gravity of the black hole. We find the mass infall rate reaches its maximum earlier for strong gravity cases because the debris is trapped in a deeper potential well of the black hole.",2019,[],5
1909.13300,astro-ph,"To extract the information that the Mg II NUV spectra (observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph; IRIS), carries about the chromosphere during solar flares, and to validate models of energy transport via model-data comparison, forward modelling is required. The assumption of statistical equilibrium is typically used to obtain the atomic level populations from snapshots of flare atmospheres, due to computational necessity. However it is possible that relying on statistical equilibrium could lead to spurious results. We compare solving the atomic level populations via statistical equilibrium versus a non-equilibrium time-dependent approach. This was achieved using flare simulations from RADYN alongside the minority species version, MSRADYN, from which the time-dependent Mg II atomic level populations and radiation transfer were computed in complete frequency redistribution. The impacts on the emergent profiles, lightcurves, line ratios, and formation heights are discussed. In summary we note that non-equilibrium effects during flares are typically important only in the initial stages and for a short period following the cessation of the energy injection. An analysis of the timescales of ionisation equilibrium reveals that for most of the duration of the flare, when the temperatures and densities are sufficiently enhanced, the relaxation timescales are short (equation s), so that the equilibrium solution is an adequate approximation. These effects vary with the size of the flare, however. In weaker flares effects can be more pronounced. We recommend that non-equilibrium effects be considered when possible, but that statistical equilibrium is sufficient at most stages of the flare.",2019,[],5
1907.07551,astro-ph,"Neutron stars are strongly magnetized rotating compact objects. Therefore they also produce huge electric fields accelerating particles to ultra-relativistic energies. The simplest magnetic topology is a dipole traditionally located at the stellar centre. In this paper, we reinvestigate the consequences of an off-centred rotating magnetic dipole, showing accurate magnetic field line geometries, the associated spin-down luminosity as well as the corresponding electromagnetic kick and torque imprinted to the neutron star. Results are obtained by time dependent numerical simulations of Maxwell equations in vacuum using pseudo-spectral methods. We compare our results to known analytical expressions available to lowest order in the parameter equation, where equation is the displacement of the dipole from the stellar centre and equation the neutron star radius. We found good agreement between our numerical computations and our analytical approximations even for well off-centred dipoles having large displacements with a sizeable fraction of the radius, i.e. equation. An explanation for binary neutron star eccentricity distribution functions is given with an emphasize on highly eccentric systems as an alternative scenario to traditional binary formation.",2019,[],5
1901.04593,astro-ph,"We perform ideal MHD high resolution AMR simulations with driven turbulence and self-gravity and find that long filamentary molecular clouds are formed at the converging locations of large-scale turbulence flows and the filaments are bounded by gravity. The magnetic field helps shape and reinforce the long filamentary structures. The main filamentary cloud has a length of ~4.4 pc. Instead of a monolithic cylindrical structure, the main cloud is shown to be a collection of fiber/web-like sub-structures similar to filamentary clouds such as L1495. Unless the line-of-sight is close to the mean field direction, the large-scale magnetic field and striations in the simulation are found roughly perpendicular to the long axis of the main cloud, similar to 1495. This provides strong support for a large-scale moderately strong magnetic field surrounding L1495. We find that the projection effect from observations can lead to incorrect interpretations of the true three-dimensional physical shape, size, and velocity structure of the clouds. Helical magnetic field structures found around filamentary clouds that are interpreted from Zeeman observations can be explained by a simple bending of the magnetic field that pierces through the cloud. We demonstrate that two dark clouds form a T-shape configuration which are strikingly similar to the Infrared dark cloud SDC13 leading to the interpretation that SDC13 results from a collision of two long filamentary clouds. We show that a moderately strong magnetic field (MA ~ 1) is crucial for maintaining a long and slender filamentary cloud for a long period of time ~0.5 million years.",2019,[],5
1907.00071,astro-ph,"We propose a new tomographic estimator for the gravitational lensing potential, based on a combination of intensity mapping (IM) and galaxy number counts. The estimator can be written schematically as IMequationgalaxy equation galaxyequationIM; this combination allows to greatly reduce the contamination by density-density correlations, thus isolating the lensing signal. As a pure cross-correlation estimator, it is additionally less susceptible to systematic effects. We show that the new estimator strongly suppresses cosmic variance and consequently improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the detection of lensing, especially on linear scales and intermediate redshifts. For cosmic variance dominated surveys the SNR of our estimator is a factor 30 larger than the SNR obtained from the correlation of galaxy number counts only. Shot noise and interferometer noise reduce the SNR. For the specific example of DES cross-correlated with HIRAX, the SNR is around 4, whereas for Euclid cross-correlated with HIRAX it reaches 52. This corresponds to an improvement of a factor 4-5 compared to the SNR from DES alone. For Euclid cross-correlated with HIRAX the improvement with respect to Euclid alone strongly depends on the redshift. We find that the improvement is particularly important for redshifts below 1.6, where it reaches 5. This makes our estimator especially valuable to test dark energy and modified gravity, that are expected to leave an impact at low and intermediate redshifts.",2019,[],5
1905.00576,astro-ph,"We present the first radio/submillimeter detection of monodeuterated methane (CHequationD) in Titan's atmosphere, using archival data from of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The equation and equation transitions at 465.235 and 465.250 GHz (equation mm) were measured at significance levels of equation and equation, respectively. These two lines were modeled using the Non-linear optimal Estimator for MultivariatE spectral analySIS (NEMESIS) radiative transfer code to determine the disk-averaged CHequationD volume mixing ratio = equation in Titan's stratosphere (at altitudes equation km). By comparison with the CHequation vertical abundance profile measured by Cassini-Huygens mass spectrometry, the resulting value for D/H in CHequation is equation. This is consistent with previous ground-based and in-situ measurements from the Cassini-Huygens mission, though slightly lower than the average of the previous values. Additional CHequationD observations at higher spatial resolution will be required to determine a value truly comparable with the Cassini-Huygens CHequation measurements, by measuring CHequationD with ALMA close to Titan's equator. In the post-Cassini era, spatially resolved observations of CHequationD with ALMA will enable the latitudinal distribution of methane to be determined, making this an important molecule for further studies.",2019,[],5
1909.10533,astro-ph,"The deuterium fractionation of water can serve as a tracer for the chemical and physical evolution of water during star formation and can constrain the origin of water in Solar System bodies. We determine the HDO/HequationO ratio in the inner warm gas toward three low-mass Class 0 protostars selected to be in isolated cores, i.e., not associated with any cloud complexes. Previous sources for which the HDO/HequationO ratio have been established were all part of larger star-forming complexes. Targeting these isolated protostars allows comparison of the water chemistry in isolated and clustered regions to determine the influence of local cloud environment. We present ALMA observations of the HDO equation-equation and equation-equation transitions at 225.897 GHz and 241.562 GHz along with the HequationO equation-equation transition at 203.407 GHz. The high angular resolution (0\farcs3-1\farcs3) allow the study of the inner warm envelope gas. Model-independent estimates for the HDO/HequationO ratios are obtained and compared with previous determinations in the warm gas toward low-mass protostars. We detect the targeted water transitions toward the three sources with S/N > 5. We determine the HDO/HequationO ratio toward L483, B335 and BHR71-IRS1 to be (equation)equation, (equation)equation, and (equation)equation, respectively, assuming equation K. The degree of water deuteration of these isolated protostars are a factor of 2-4 higher relative to Class 0 protostars that are members of known nearby clustered star-forming regions. The results indicate that the water deuterium fractionation is influenced by the local cloud environment. This effect can be explained by variations in either collapse timescales or temperatures, which depends on local cloud dynamics and could provide a new method to decipher the history of young stars.",2019,[],5
1903.06962,astro-ph,"We present an ALMA survey of dust continuum emission in a sample of 70 galaxies in the redshift range z=2-5 selected from the CANDELS GOODS-S field. Multi-Epoch Abundance Matching (MEAM) is used to define potential progenitors of a z = 0 galaxy of stellar mass 1.5 1011 Msun. Gas masses are derived from the 850um luminosity. Ancillary data from the CANDELS GOODS-S survey are used to derive the gas mass fractions. The results at z<=3 are mostly in accord with expectations: The detection rates are 75% for the z=2 redshift bin, 50% for the z=3 bin and 0% for z>=4. The average gas mass fraction for the detected z=2 galaxies is fgas = 0.55/-0.12 and fgas = 0.62/-0.15 for the z=3 sample. This agrees with expectations for galaxies on the star-forming main sequence, and shows that gas fractions have decreased at a roughly constant rate from z=3 to z=0. Stacked images of the galaxies not detected with ALMA give upper limits to fgas of <0.08 and <0.15, for the z=2 and z=3 redshift bins. None of our galaxies in the z=4 and z=5 sample are detected and the upper limit from stacked images, corrected for low metallicity, is fgas<0.66. We do not think that lower gas-phase metallicities can entirely explain the lower dust luminosities. We briefly consider the possibility of accretion of very low-metallicity gas to explain the absence of detectable dust emission in our galaxies at z>4.",2019,[],5
1910.07345,astro-ph,"Volatile molecules are critical to terrestrial planetary habitability, yet difficult to observe directly where planets form at the midplanes of protoplanetary disks. It is unclear whether the inner 1 AU of disks are volatile-poor or if this region is resupplied with ice-rich dust from colder disk regions. Dust traps at radial pressure maxima bounding disk gaps can cut off the inner disk from such volatile reservoirs. However, the trap retention efficiency and atomic composition of trapped dust have not been measured.   We present a new technique to measure the absolute atomic abundances in gas accreting onto T Tauri stars and infer the bulk atomic composition and distribution of midplane solids retained in the disk around the young star TW Hya. We identify line emission from gas-phase material inside the dust sublimation rim of TW Hya. Gaussian decomposition of the strongest H Paschen lines isolates the inner disk hydrogen emission. We measure several key elemental abundances, relative to hydrogen, using a chemical photoionization model and infer dust retention in the disk. With a 1D transport model, we determine approximate radial locations and retention efficiencies of dust traps for different elements. Volatile and refractory elements are depleted from TW Hya's hot gas by factors of ~102 and up to 105, respectively. Dust traps beyond the CO and N2 snowline cumulatively sequester 96% of the total dust, while the trap at 2 AU retains 3% of the initial dust mass. The high depletions of Si, Mg, and Ca are explained by a third trap at 0.3 AU. TW Hya has a significant volatile reservoir rich in C- and N-ices in its outer ring structure. However, the lack of C resupply may leave the terrestrial planet-forming region dry and carbon-poor. Any planets that form within the silicate dust trap at 0.3 AU may resemble Earth in terms of the degree of their volatile depletion.",2019,[],5
1902.05440,astro-ph,"In this paper, we describe Fourier-based Wave Front Sensors (WFS) as linear integral operators, characterized by their Kernel. In a first part, we derive the dependency of this quantity with respect to the WFS's optical parameters: pupil geometry, filtering mask, tip/tilt modulation. In a second part we focus the study on the special case of convolutional Kernels. The assumptions required to be in such a regime are described. We then show that these convolutional kernels allow to drastically simplify the WFS's model by summarizing its behavior in a concise and comprehensive quantity called the WFS's Impulse Response. We explain in particular how it allows to compute the sensor's sensitivity with respect to the spatial frequencies. Such an approach therefore provides a fast diagnostic tool to compare and optimize Fourier-based WFSs. In a third part, we develop the impact of the residual phases on the sensor's impulse response, and show that the convolutional model remains valid.

1912.05429,astro-ph,"The distribution of spin direction of ~6.4*104 spiral galaxies with spectra was examined. The analysis shows a statistically significant cosmological-scale asymmetry between galaxies with opposite spin direction. The data also reveals that the asymmetry changes with the direction of observation, and with the redshift. The redshift dependence shows that the distribution of the spin direction of galaxies becomes more homogeneous as the redshift gets higher. The data also show photometric differences between galaxies with opposite spin patterns. When normalizing the data by the redshift, the photometric asymmetry is eliminated. However, when normalizing the data by the magnitude, statistically significant differences in the redshift remain. These evidence suggest a violation of the cosmological isotropy and homogeneity assumptions. Fitting the distribution of the galaxy spin directions to a quadrupole alignment provides fitness with statistical significance >5 sigma, which grows to >8 sigma when just galaxies with equation are used. The data analysis process is fully automatic, and it is based on deterministic and symmetric algorithms with defined rules.

We find that atmospheric spectral features, including biosignatures like O2 in combination with a reduced gas like CH4 for oxic atmospheres, as well as climate indicators like CO2 and H2O for all atmospheres, show absorption features in the spectra of Proxima b and Trappist-1e models. However for some features like oxygen, high-resolution observations will be critical to identify them in a planet's reflected flux.

The companion has a minimum mass of 60.4/-2.2 MJ and might be a brown dwarf. Its expected semi-major axis of ~243 mas makes it a suitable target for further characterization with high-contrast imaging, in particular to measure its inclination, mass, and spectrum and thus definitely establish its substellar nature. Aims. We aim to further characterize the orbit, atmosphere, and physical nature of HD72946B. Methods. We present high-contrast imaging data in the near-infrared with the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE) instrument. We also use proper motion measurements of the star from Hipparcos and Gaia. Results. The SPHERE data reveal a point source with a contrast of ~9 mag at a projected separation of ~235 mas. No other point sources are detected in the field of view. By jointly fitting the RV, imaging, and proper motion data, we constrain all the orbital parameters of HD72946B and assess a dynamical mass of 72.4/-1.6 MJ and a semi-major axis of 6.45equation au. Empirical comparison of its IFS spectrum to template dwarfs indicates a spectral type of L5.0/-1.5. The J-H3 color is close to the expectations of the DUSTY models and suggests a cloudy atmosphere. Comparison with atmospheric models of the spectrophotometry suggests an effective temperature of ~1700 K.

We improve a technique we introduced earlier, which is based on galaxy color and luminosity, and is insensitive to details of the star formation history, to include the normalization. Assuming a power-law dependence of the supernova rate with time, equation, we find a power-law index equation and a normalization equation, corresponding to a number of type Ia supernovae integrated over a Hubble time of equation. We also implement a method used by Maoz and collaborators, which is based on star formation history reconstruction, and find that this gives a consistent result for the slope, but a lower, marginally inconsistent normalization.

1904.08327,astro-ph,"Some of the white dwarfs exhibit among the strongest magnetic fields in the universe. Many of these degenerate magnetic stars are also rotating very slowly. Among these objects, Grw70equation\,8247, with its century-long suspected rotation period and its 400\,MG magnetic field, stands as a particularly interesting object. Surprisingly, for this star, the first white dwarf in which a magnetic field was discovered, no spectropolarimetric observations have been discussed in the literature in the last 40 years. Here we present two sets of linear and circular polarisation spectra taken in 2015 and 2018, and we compare them with spectropolarimetric data obtained in the 1970s. Polarisation shows variability over a time interval of four decades, but some subtle changes may have been detected even over a three year time interval. Using the variation of the polarisation position angle as a proxy for the rotation of the magnetic axis in the plane of the sky, we conclude that the star's rotation period probably lies in the range of equation to equation years. Our data analysis is accompanied by a description of our various calibrations and tests of the ISIS instrument at the William Herschel Telescope that may be of general interest for linear spectropolarimetric measurements.

1912.07007,astro-ph,"Ultraviolet over-ionisation of iron atoms in the solar atmosphere leads to deviations in their level populations from the Saha-Boltzmann statistics. This causes their line profiles to form in Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) conditions. While inverting such profiles to determine atmospheric parameters, the NLTE effects are often neglected and deviations from LTE are compensated for by tweaking other quantities. We investigate how the routinely employed LTE inversion of iron lines formed in NLTE under- or over-estimates atmospheric quantities such as temperature (T), line-of-sight velocity (vLOS), magnetic field strength (B) and inclination (gamma) while the previous papers have focused mainly on T. We synthesize the Stokes profiles of Fe I 6301.5 A and 6302.5 A lines in both LTE and NLTE using a snapshot of a 3D MHD simulation. The profiles are then inverted in LTE. By considering the atmosphere inferred from inversion of LTE profiles to be the fiducial model, we compare atmosphere from the inversion of NLTE profiles with it. Any differences observed are attributed to NLTE effects. Neglecting the NLTE effects introduces errors in the inverted atmosphere. While the errors in T can go up to 13%, in vLOS and B the errors can be as high as 50% or more. We find these errors to be present at all three inversion nodes. Importantly, they survive degradation from spatial averaging of the profiles. We give an overview of how the neglect of NLTE effects influences the values of T, vLOS, B and gamma determined by inverting Fe I 6300 A line pair, as observed, e.g., by Hinode. Errors are found at the sites of granules, intergranular lanes, magnetic elements, basically in every region susceptible to NLTE effects. For an accurate determination of atmospheric quantities and their stratification, it is therefore important to take account of NLTE effects.",2019,[],5
1907.02328,astro-ph,"We show that peculiar velocities of Type Ia supernovae can be used to derive constraints on the sum of neutrino masses, equation, and dark energy equation of state, equation, from measurements of the magnitude-redshift relation, complementary to galaxy redshift and weak lensing surveys. Light from a supernova propagates through a perturbed Universe so the luminosity distance is modified from its homogeneous prediction. This modification is proportional to the matter density fluctuation and its time derivative due to gravitational lensing and peculiar velocity respectively. At low redshifts, the peculiar velocity signal dominates while at high redshifts lensing does. We show that using lensing and peculiar velocity of supernovae from the upcoming surveys WFIRST and ZTF, without other observations, we can constrain equation eV, equation, and equation (equation CL) in the equation-equation-equation parameter space, where all the other cosmological parameters are fixed.

We also identified 20 stellar objects, which showed not only a significant variability of the equivalent width, but which also change their apparent evolutionary stage.   The analysis of data obtained over a wide wavelength range (from X-ray to mid-infrared) has shown that Ha activity and the measure of its variability are in good agreement with the activity of stellar objects measured with its other parameters, such as X-ray radiation and the mass accretion rate. The EW(Ha) differs not only between objects at different evolutionary stages, but also between variable and non-variable objects. The variables in the CTT and WTT samples are more active than non-variables although they have almost the same evolutionary age. Another distinct difference between these variables and non-variables is their average masses. The variables from both CTT and WTT samples are noticeably more massive than non-variables. Our data confirm the assumption made for other star formation regions, that the decay of accretion activity occurs more slowly for more massive CTT objects. Apparently, a similar trend is also present in WTT objects, which are at a later stage of evolution. The variability of the stellar objects, which change their evolutionary classes, at least in a fraction of them, is due to the fact that they are close binaries, which affects and modulates their Ha emission activity.",2019,[],5
1902.08326,astro-ph,"We present a systematic study of the 3.0 um H2O ice and the 3.4 um aliphatic carbon absorption features toward 48 local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) using spectra obtained by the AKARI Infrared Camera to investigate the UV environment in their star-forming regions. All the ULIRGs in our sample exhibit a ratio of optical depth of H2O ice to silicate dust (tau3.0/tau9.7) that is lower than that in the Taurus dark cloud. This implies that ULIRGs cannot be described as an ensemble of low-mass star-forming regions and that a significant amount of high-mass star-forming regions contribute to star-forming clouds in local ULIRGs. The results also show that the ratios of optical depth of aliphatic carbon to silicate dust, tau3.4/tau9.7, exhibit diverse values. We investigate two effects that can affect this ratio: the geometric temperature gradient (which increases the ratio) and the intense UV environment (which decreases it). The geometric temperature gradient is typically considered as a sign of active galactic nuclei (AGN). ULIRGs with AGN signs (optical classification, NIR color, and a PAH emission strength of 3.3 um) indeed tend to exhibit a large tau3.4/tau9.7 ratio. However, we find that the presence of buried AGN is not the only cause of the geometric temperature gradient, because the enhancement of the ratio is also evident in pure starburst-like ULIRGs without these AGN signs. Regarding the intense UV environment in star-forming regions, the correlation between the aliphatic carbon ratio and the ratio of the [C II] 158 um line luminosity to the far-infrared luminosity (L[CII]/LFIR), which represents the UV environment in photodissociation regions, implies that the intense UV environment causes the decrease of the aliphatic carbon ratio. We find that an intense UV environment (G/nH > 3) in star-forming regions is needed for the aliphatic carbon ratio to be suppressed.",2019,[],5
1910.08530,astro-ph,"Lunar rocks are severely depleted in moderately volatile elements such as Rb, K, and Zn relative to Earth. Identifying the cause of this depletion is important for understanding how the Earth-Moon system evolved in the aftermath of the Moon-forming giant impact. We measured the Rb isotopic compositions of lunar and terrestrial rocks to understand why moderately volatile elements are depleted in the Moon. Combining our new measurements with previous data reveals that the Moon has an 87Rb/85Rb ratio higher than Earth by 0.16 permil. This isotopic composition is consistent with evaporation of Rb into a vapor medium that was ~99 percent saturated. Evaporation under this saturation can also explain the previously documented isotopic fractionations of K, Ga, Cu and Zn of lunar rocks relative to Earth. We show that a possible setting for achieving the same saturation upon evaporation of elements with such diverse volatilities is through viscous drainage of a partially vaporized protolunar disk onto Earth. In the framework of an alpha-disk model, the alpha-viscosity needed to explain the ~99% saturation calculated here is 0.001 to 0.01, which is consistent with a vapor disk where viscosity is controlled by magnetorotational instability.",2019,[],5
1904.07905,astro-ph,"Context. Accurate model predictions including the physics of baryons are required to make the most of the upcoming large cosmological surveys devoted to gravitational lensing. The advent of hydrodynamical cosmological simulations enables such predictions on sufficiently sizeable volumes. Aims. Lensing quantities (deflection, shear, convergence) and their statistics (convergence power spectrum, shear correlation functions, galaxy-galaxy lensing) are computed in the past lightcone built in the Horizon-AGN hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, which implements our best knowledge on baryonic physics at the galaxy scale in order to mimic galaxy populations over cosmic time. Methods. Lensing quantities are generated over a one square degree field of view by performing multiple-lens plane ray-tracing through the lightcone, taking full advantage of the 1 kpc resolution and splitting the line of sight over 500 planes all the way to redshift z~7. Two methods are explored (standard projection of particles with adaptive smoothing, and integration of the acceleration field) to assert a good implementation. The focus is on small scales where baryons matter most. Results. Standard cosmic shear statistics are impacted at the 10% level by the baryonic component for angular scales below a few arcmin. The galaxy-galaxy lensing signal, or galaxy-shear correlation function, is consistent with measurements for the redshift z~0.5 massive galaxy population. At higher redshift z>1, the impact of magnification bias on this correlation is relevant for separations greater than 1 Mpc. Conclusions. This work is pivotal for all current and upcoming weak lensing surveys and represents a first step towards building a full end-to-end generation of lensed mock images from large cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.",2019,[],5
1911.02439,astro-ph,"We report the discovery and the analysis of the short (tE < 5 days) planetary microlensing event, OGLE-2015-BLG-1771. The event was discovered by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE), and the planetary anomaly (at I ~ 19) was captured by The Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet). The event has three surviving planetary models that explain the observed light curves, with planet-host mass ratio q \~ 5.4 * 10-3, 4.5 * 10-3 and 4.5 * 10-2, respectively. The first model is the best-fit model, while the second model is disfavored by letterletter2 ~ 3. The last model is strongly disfavored by letterletter2 ~ 15 but not ruled out. A Bayesian analysis using a Galactic model indicates that the first two models are probably composed of a Saturn-mass planet orbiting a late M dwarf, while the third one could consist of a super-Jovian planet and a mid-mass brown dwarf.

1901.10574,astro-ph,"This paper is in response to a technical paper, entitled ""Evidence for a New Component of High-Energy Solar Gamma-Ray Production"" (Linden, et al., 2018). An article in Scientific American entitled ""The Sun Is Spitting Out Strange Patterns of Gamma Rays-and No One Knows Why"" is a discussion of Linden's paper. It may be summarized as follows: The Sun has been observed to be emitting gamma ray bursts. The weaker gamma rays tend to be less than 50 GeV, emitted during the most active energetic period of the solar cycle and towards the poles. The gamma-ray emission is most intense during Solar Minimum, reaching >100 GeV and those emissions are near the equator: ""Most strikingly, although 6 gamma rays above 100 GeV are observed during the 1.4 years of solar minimum, none are observed during the next 7.8 years (Linden, et al., 2018)."" Pease and Glenn, in the conclusion of a recent paper, suggested that solar cycles are regulated by planetary orbital positions, influencing the Sun through transfer of gravitational or electromagnetic forces, or both (Pease & Glenn, 2016). This paper will describe a working hypothesis that points strongly to electromagnetic connections between Jupiter, Saturn, and the Sun during Solar Minimum which contribute to the high gamma-ray energy observed being emitted by the Sun. The hypothesis further suggests that the electromagnetic connections between the Sun and Jupiter, Saturn, and other planets with magnetospheres, namely Neptune, Earth, and Uranus, are responsible over billions of years for modulating a dual electromagnetic field resonance internal to the Sun. These major periodic cycles are known as the 11-year Schwabe and 22-year Hale solar cycles.",2019,[],5

1904.09581,astro-ph,"During the dawn of chemistry when the temperature of the young Universe had fallen below equation4000 K, the ions of the light elements produced in Big Bang nucleosynthesis recombined in reverse order of their ionization potential. With its higher ionization potentials, Heequation (54.5 eV) and Heequation (24.6 eV) combined first with free electrons to form the first neutral atom, prior to the recombination of hydrogen (13.6 eV). At that time, in this metal-free and low-density environment, neutral helium atoms formed the Universe's first molecular bond in the helium hydride ion HeHequation, by radiative association with protons (He  Hequation equation HeHequation  hequation). As recombination progressed, the destruction of HeHequation (HeHequation  H equation He  Hequation) created a first path to the formation of molecular hydrogen, marking the beginning of the Molecular Age. Despite its unquestioned importance for the evolution of the early Universe, the HeHequation molecule has so far escaped unequivocal detection in interstellar space. In the laboratory, the ion was discovered as long ago as 1925, but only in the late seventies was the possibility that HeHequation might exist in local astrophysical plasmas discussed. In particular, the conditions in planetary nebulae were shown to be suitable for the production of potentially detectable HeHequation column densities: the hard radiation field from the central hot white dwarf creates overlapping Stromgren spheres, where HeHequation is predicted to form, primarily by radiative association of Heequation and H. With the GREAT spectrometer onboard SOFIA, the HeHequation rotational ground-state transition at equation149.1 equationm is now accessible.

1905.06935,astro-ph,"We present a method for deriving the electron density of ionized gas using the ratio of the intensity of the [NII] 205um line to that of Hydrogen radio recombination lines (RRL). We use this method to derive electron densities of 21 velocity components in 11 lines of sight through the Galaxy, including the Galactic center. We observed, at high--spectral resolution, the [NII] 205um line with the Herschel/HIFI and SOFIA/GREAT instruments and the radio recombination lines with the Green Bank Telescope and the NASA Deep Space Network Deep Space Station 43 (DSS--43) telescope. We find typical electron densities between 6 to 170 cm-3, which are consistent with those derived at low spectral resolution using the [NII] 205um/122um line ratio with Herschel/PACS on a larger sample of sight lines in the Galactic plane. By matching the electron densities derived from the [NII] 205um/RRL intensity ratio and the [NII] 122um/205um intensity ratio, we derive the nitrogen fractional abundance for most of the velocity components. We investigate the dependence of the N/H ratio with Galactocentric distance in the inner Galaxy (Rgal<6 kpc, which is inaccessible in optical studies due to dust extinction. We find that the distribution of nitrogen abundances in the inner galaxy derived from our data has a slope that is consistent to that found in the outer Galaxy in optical studies. This result is inconsistent with some suggestions of a flatter distribution of the nitrogen abundance in the inner galaxy.",2019,[],5
1904.04261,astro-ph,"We present 25 cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies in the `MOdelling Star cluster population Assembly In Cosmological Simulations within EAGLE' (E-MOSAICS) project. E-MOSAICS couples a detailed physical model for the formation, evolution, and disruption of star clusters to the EAGLE galaxy formation simulations. This enables following the co-formation and co-evolution of galaxies and their star cluster populations, thus realising the long-standing promise of using globular clusters (GCs) as tracers of galaxy formation and assembly. The simulations show that the age-metallicity distributions of GC populations exhibit strong galaxy-to-galaxy variations, resulting from differences in their evolutionary histories. We develop a formalism for systematically constraining the assembly histories of galaxies using GC age-metallicity distributions. These distributions are characterised through 13 metrics that we correlate with 30 quantities describing galaxy formation and assembly (e.g. halo properties, formation/assembly redshifts, stellar mass assembly time-scales, galaxy merger statistics), resulting in 20 statistically (highly) significant correlations. The GC age-metallicity distribution is a sensitive probe of the mass growth, metal enrichment, and minor merger history of the host galaxy. No such relation is found between GCs and major mergers, which play a sub-dominant role in GC formation for Milky Way-mass galaxies. Finally, we show how the GC age-metallicity distribution enables the reconstruction of the host galaxy's merger tree, allowing us to identify all progenitors with masses equation Mequation for redshifts equation. These results demonstrate that cosmological simulations of the co-formation and co-evolution of GCs and their host galaxies successfully unlock the potential of GCs as quantitative tracers of galaxy formation and assembly.",2019,[],5
1908.04429,astro-ph,"We present the first measurements of [Fe/H] and [equation/Fe] abundances, obtained using spectral synthesis modeling, for red giant branch stars in M31's giant stellar stream. The spectroscopic observations, obtained at a projected distance of 17 kpc from M31's center, yielded 61 stars with [Fe/H] measurements, including 21 stars with [equation/Fe] measurements, from 112 targets identified as M31 stars. The [Fe/H] measurements confirm the expectation from photometric metallicity estimates that stars in this region of M31's halo are relatively metal-rich compared to stars in the MW's inner halo: more than half the stars in the field, including those not associated with kinematically identified substructure, have [Fe/H] abundances equation. The stars in this field are equation-enhanced at lower metallicities, while [equation/Fe] decreases with increasing [Fe/H] above metallicities of [Fe/H] equation. Three kinematical components have been previously identified in this field: the giant stellar stream, a second kinematically cold feature of unknown origin, and M31's kinematically hot halo. We compare probabilistic [Fe/H] and [equation/Fe] distribution functions for each of the components. The giant stellar stream and the second kinematically cold feature have very similar abundance distributions, while the halo component is more metal-poor. Although the current sample sizes are small, a comparison of the abundances of stars in the giant stellar stream field with abundances of M31 halo and dSph stars from the literature indicate that the progenitor of the stream was likely more massive, and experienced a higher efficiency of star formation, than M31's existing dSphs or the dEs NGC147 and NGC185.",2019,[],5
1909.03960,astro-ph,"AGNs are believed to be the source of very energetic cosmic rays which, in turn, produce gamma rays throughout the interactions with matter. Therefore, the study of their very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray spectra is fundamental to understand the cosmic-ray acceleration mechanisms in these objects. Blazars are the most common type of AGNs populating gamma-ray catalogs, among these sources BL-Lacs present featureless or very weak emission/absorption lines spectra. Given that the extragalactic VHE gamma-ray catalog is poorly populated (about 70 blazars), having a redshift estimation of every single source is important for the study of cosmic rays origin. In this work we use EBL absorption as a tool to estimate KUV 00311-1938 redshift by comparing HE gamma-ray observations with modeled EBL absorbed flux points. KUV 00311-1938 is a very interesting BL-Lac; a priori it can be one of the most distant blazars since it has an estimated redshift in the range 0.5 to 1.54. Assuming that there is no spectral cutoff, we consider the intrinsic VHE spectrum to be the extrapolation of the Fermi-LAT spectrum and model the intergalactic absorption by using the main current EBL models. Comparing these results with the VHE measured point by H.E.S.S., we give an estimate for the redshift of the blazar within observation errors.",2019,[],5

1903.00020,astro-ph,"Supermassive stars (SMSs) are candidates for being progenitors of supermassive quasars at high redshifts. However, their formation process requires strong mechanisms that would be able to extract the angular momentum of the gas that the SMSs accrete. We investigate under which conditions the magnetic coupling between an accreting SMS and its winds can remove enough angular momentum for accretion to proceed from a Keplerian disc. We numerically computed the rotational properties of accreting SMSs that rotate at the equation-limit and estimated the magnetic field that is required to maintain the rotation velocity at this limit using prescriptions from magnetohydrodynamical simulations of stellar winds. We find that a magnetic field of 10 kG at the stellar surface is required to satisfy the constraints on stellar rotation from the equation-limit. Magnetic coupling between the envelope of SMSs and their winds could allow for SMS formation by accretion from a Keplerian disc, provided the magnetic field is at the upper end of present-day observed stellar fields. Such fields are consistent with primordial origins.",2019,[],5
1906.09454,astro-ph,"The escape process of particles accelerated at supernova remnant (SNR) shocks is one of the poorly understood aspects of the shock acceleration theory. Here we adopt a phenomenological approach to study the particle escape and its impact on the gamma-ray spectrum resulting from hadronic collisions both inside and outside of a middle-aged SNR. Under the assumption that in the spatial region immediately outside of the remnant the diffusion coefficient is suppressed with respect to the average Galactic one, we show that a significant fraction of particles are still located inside the SNR long time after their nominal release from the acceleration region. This fact results into a gamma-ray spectrum that resembles a broken power law, similar to those observed in several middle-aged SNRs. Above the break, the spectral steepening is determined by the diffusion coefficient outside of the SNR and by the time dependence of maximum energy. Consequently, the comparison between the model prediction and actual data will contribute to determining these two quantities, the former being particularly relevant within the predictions of the gamma-ray emission from the halo of escaping particles around SNRs which could be detected with future Cherenkov telescope facilities. We also calculate the spectrum of run-away particles injected into the Galaxy by an individual remnant. Assuming that the acceleration stops before the SNR enters the snowplow phase, we show that the released spectrum can be a featureless power law only if the accelerated spectrum has a slope alpha > 4.",2019,[],5

1901.02831,astro-ph,"Context: Seasonal variations and climate stability of a planet are very sensitive to the planet obliquity and its evolution. This is of particular interest for the emergence and sustainability of land-based life, but orbital and rotational parameters of exoplanets are still poorly constrained. Numerical explorations usually realised in this situation are thus in heavy contrast with the uncertain nature of the available data.   Aims: We aim to provide an analytical formulation of the long-term spin-axis dynamics of exoplanets, linking it directly to physical and dynamical parameters, but still giving precise quantitative results if the parameters are well known. Together with bounds for the poorly constrained parameters of exoplanets, this analysis is designed to allow a quick and straightforward exploration of the spin-axis dynamics.   Methods: The long-term orbital solution is decomposed in quasi-periodic series and the spin-axis Hamiltonian is expanded in powers of eccentricity and inclination. Chaotic zones are measured by the resonance overlap criterion. Bounds for the poorly known parameters of exoplanets are obtained from physical grounds (rotational breakup) and dynamical considerations (equipartition of AMD).   Results: This method gives accurate results when the orbital evolution is well known. The chaotic zones for planets of the Solar System can be retrieved in details from simple analytical formulas. For less constrained planetary systems, the maximal extent of the chaotic regions can be computed, requiring only the mass, the semi-major axis and the eccentricity of the planets present in the system. Additionally, some estimated bounds of the precession constant allow to classify which observed exoplanets are necessarily out of major spin-orbit secular resonances (unless the precession rate is affected by the presence of massive satellites).",2019,[],5

Barium stars, having an enhanced carbon abundance, exhibit the ""Bond-Neff effect""--a broad depression in their energy distributions at ~4000 A, recently confirmed to be due to the CH molecule.

Most CDRGs lie in a fairly tight clump in the CMD, indicating initial masses in the range ~2 to 3.5 Msun, if they have evolved as single stars. It is unclear whether they are stars that have just reached the base of the red-giant branch and the first dredge-up of CN-processed material, or are more highly evolved helium-burning stars in the red-giant clump. About 10% of CDRGs have higher masses of ~4 to 4.5 Msun, and exhibit unusually high rotational velocities.

Despite decades of research, joint observations of EUV and Moreton-Ramsey waves remain rare, complicating efforts to quantify the connection between these phenomena. We present observations of four homologous global waves originating from the same active region between 28-30 March 2014 and observed using both EUV and H-alpha data. Each global EUV wave was observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory, with the associated Moreton-Ramsey waves identified using the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) network. All of the global waves exhibit high initial velocity (e.g., 842-1388 km sequation in the 193A passband) and strong deceleration (e.g., -1437 - -782 m sequation in the 193A passband) in each of the EUV passbands studied, with the EUV wave kinematics exceeding those of the Moreton-Ramsey wave. The density compression ratio of each global wave was estimated using both differential emission measure and intensity variation techniques, with both indicating that the observed waves were weakly shocked with a fast magnetosonic Mach number slightly greater than one. This suggests that, according to current models, the global coronal waves were not strong enough to produce Moreton-Ramsey waves, indicating an alternative explanation for these observations. Instead, we conclude that the evolution of the global waves was restricted by the surrounding coronal magnetic field, in each case producing a downward-angled wavefront propagating towards the north solar pole which perturbed the chromosphere and was observed as a Moreton-Ramsey wave.",2019,[],5

This DLA was known to be associated with a galaxy group of dynamical mass Mgroup ~3e12 Msun, but its physical origin remained ambiguous. New wide-field integral field observations revealed a giant nebula detected in [OII], Hletter, [OIII], H\alpha, and [NII] emission, with the line-emitting gas following closely the motions of group galaxies. One of the denser streams passes directly in front of the QSO with kinematics consistent with the absorption profiles recorded in the QSO echelle spectra. The emission morphology, kinematics, and line ratios of the nebula suggest that shocks and turbulent mixing layers, produced as a result of stripped gaseous streams moving at supersonic speed across the ambient hot medium, contribute significantly to the ionization of the gas. While the DLA may not be associated with any specific detected member of the group, both the kinematic and dust properties are consistent with the DLA originating in streams of gas stripped from sub-L* group members at <~25 pkpc from the QSO sightline. This study demonstrates that gas stripping in low-mass galaxy groups is effective in releasing metal-enriched gas from star-forming regions, producing absorption systems in QSO spectra, and that combining absorption and emission-line observations provides an exciting new opportunity for studying gas and galaxy co-evolution.",2019,[],5
1907.00805,astro-ph,"The radius of the L chondrite parent body, its formation time, and its evolution history are determined by fitting theoretical models to empirical data of radioisotopic chronometers for L chondrites. A simplified evolution model for the L chondrite parent body is constructed considering sintering of the initially porous material, temperature dependent heat conductivity, and an insulating regolith layer. Such models are fitted to thermochronological data of five meteorites for which precise data for the Hf-W and U-Pb-Pb thermochronometers have been published. A set of parameters for the L chondrite parent body is found that yields excellent agreement (within error bounds) between a thermal evolution model and thermochonological data. Empirical cooling rate data also agree with the model results within error bounds such that there is no conflict between cooling rate data and the onion-shell model. Two models are found to be compatible with the presently available empirical data: One model with a radius of 115 km and a formation time of 1.89 Ma after CAI formation, another model with 160 km radius and formation time of 1.835 Ma. The central temperature of the smaller body remains well below the Ni,Fe-FeS eutectic melting temperature and is consistent with the apparent non-existence of primitive achondrites related to the L chondrites. For the bigger model incipient melting in the central core region is predicted which opens the possibility that primitive achondrites related to L chondrites could be found.",2019,[],5
1903.07626,astro-ph,"By utilizing large-scale graph analytic tools implemented in the modern Big Data platform, Apache Spark, we investigate the topological structure of gravitational clustering in five different universes produced by cosmological equation-body simulations with varying parameters: (1) a WMAP 5-year compatible equationCDM cosmology, (2) two different dark energy equation of state variants, and (3) two different cosmic matter density variants. For the Big Data calculations, we use a custom build of stand-alone Spark/Hadoop cluster at Korea Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS) and Dataproc Compute Engine in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with the sample size ranging from 7 millions to 200 millions. We find that among the many possible graph-topological measures, three simple ones: (1) the average of number of neighbors (the so-called average vertex degree) equation, (2) closed-to-connected triple fraction (the so-called transitivity) equation, and (3) the cumulative number density equation of subcomponents with connected component size equation, can effectively discriminate among the five model universes. Since these graph-topological measures are in direct relation with the usual equation-points correlation functions of the cosmic density field, graph-topological statistics powered by Big Data computational infrastructure opens a new, intuitive, and computationally efficient window into the dark Universe.",2019,[],5
1902.09804,astro-ph,"Stars formed in clusters can encounter other stars at close distances. In typical open clusters in the Solar neighbourhood containing hundreds or thousands of member stars, ten to twenty per cent of Solar-mass member stars are expected to encounter another star at distances closer than 100 au. These close encounters strongly perturb the planetary systems, directly causing ejection of planets or their capture by the intruding star, as well as exciting the orbits. Using extensive equation-body simulations, we study such fly-by encounters between two Solar System analogues, each with four giant planets from Jupiter to Neptune. We quantify the rates of loss and capture immediately after the encounter, e.g., the Neptune analogue is lost in one in four encounters within 100 au, and captured by the flying-by star in one in twelve encounters. We then perform long-term (up to 1 Gyr) simulations investigating the ensuing post-encounter evolution. We show that large numbers of planets are removed from systems due to planet--planet interactions and that captured planets further enhance the system instability. While encounters can initially leave a planetary system containing more planets by inserting additional ones, the long-term instability causes a net reduction in planet number. A captured planet ends up on a retrograde orbit in half of the runs in which it survives for 1 Gyr; also, a planet bound to its original host star but flipped during the encounter may survive. Thus, encounters between planetary systems are a channel to create counter-rotating planets, This would happen in around 1% of systems, and such planets are potentially detectable through astrometry or direct imaging.",2019,[],5
1912.05884,astro-ph,"In this paper we propose a new mechanism that could explain the survival of hydrogen atmospheres on some hot super-Earths. We argue that on close-orbiting tidally-locked super-Earths the tidal forces with the orbital and rotational centrifugal forces can partially confine the atmosphere on the nightside. Assuming a super terran body with an atmosphere dominated by volcanic species and a large hydrogen component, the heavier molecules can be shown to be confined within latitudes of equation whilst the volatile hydrogen is not. Because of this disparity the hydrogen has to slowly diffuse out into the dayside where XUV irradiation destroys it. For this mechanism to take effect it is necessary for the exoplanet to become tidally locked before losing the totality of its hydrogen envelop. Consequently, for super-Earths with this proposed configuration it is possible to solve the tidal-locking and mass-loss timescales in order to constrain their formation `birth' masses. Our model predicts that 55 Cancri e formed with a day-length between approximately equation hours and an initial mass less than equation hence allowing it to become tidally locked before the complete destruction of its atmosphere. For comparison, CoRoT-7b, an exoplanet with very similar properties to 55 Cancri e but lacking an atmosphere, formed with a day-length significantly different from equation hours whilst also having an initial mass smaller than equation",2019,[],5
1901.07741,astro-ph,"Coronal loops in active regions are the subjects of intensive investigation, but the important diffuse 'unresolved' emission in which they are embedded has received relatively little attention. Here we measure the densities and emission measure (EM) distributions of a sample of background-foreground regions surrounding warm (2 MK) coronal loops, and introduce two new aspects to the analysis. First, we infer the EM distributions only from temperatures that contribute to the same background emission. Second, we measure the background emission co-spatially with the loops so that the results are truly representative of the immediate loop environment. The second aspect also allows us to take advantage of the presence of embedded loops to infer information about the (unresolvable) magnetic field in the background. We find that about half the regions in our sample have narrow but not quite isothermal EM distributions with a peak temperature of 1.4--2 MK. The other half have broad EM distributions (Gaussian width equation3equation10equation K), and the width of the EM appears to be correlated with peak temperature. Densities in the diffuse background are equation (n/cmequation) = 8.5-9.0. Significantly, these densities and temperatures imply that the co-spatial background is broadly comptabile with static equilibrium theory (RTV scaling laws) provided the unresolved field length is comparable to the embedded loop length. For this agreement to break down, the field length in most cases would have to be substantially longer than the loop length, a factor of 2--3 on average, which for our sample approaches the dimensions of only the largest active regions.",2019,[],5
1903.01597,astro-ph,"Explaining the internal distribution and motions of stars and gas in galaxies is a key aspect in understanding their evolution. In previous work we identified five well resolved galaxies with atypical kinematics from a cosmological simulation; two had kinematically distinct cores (KDCs), and three had counter-rotating gas and stars (CRGD). In this paper, we show that i) the KDC galaxies have flattening of stellar [O/Fe] at large galacto-centric radii due to the minor mergers that gave rise to the KDCs, and ii) the CRGD galaxies have an abrupt transition in the gas metallicity maps, from high metallicity in the centre to very low metallicity further out. These galaxies are embedded in dark matter filaments where there is a ready supply of near-pristine gas to cause this effect. The non-linear increase in gas metallicity is also seen in the radial profiles, but when the metallicity gradients are measured, the difference is buried in the scatter of the relation. We also find that all five galaxies are fairly compact, with small effective radii given their stellar masses. This is because they have not experienced major mergers that kinematically heat the stars, and would have destroyed their unusual kinematics. In order to detect these signatures of minor mergers or accretion, the galaxy scaling relations or radial metallicity profiles are not enough, and it is necessary to obtain the 2D maps with integral field spectroscopy observations.",2019,[],5
1901.06187,astro-ph,"Asteroseismic analysis of solar-like stars allows us to determine physical parameters such as stellar mass, with a higher precision compared to most other methods. Even in a well-studied cluster such as the Hyades, the masses of the red giant stars are not well known, and previous mass estimates are based on model calculations (isochrones). The four known red giants in the Hyades are assumed to be clump (core-helium-burning) stars based on their positions in colour-magnitude diagrams, however asteroseismology offers an opportunity to test this assumption. Using asteroseismic techniques combined with other methods, we aim to derive physical parameters and the evolutionary stage for the planet hosting star epsilon Tau, which is one of the four red giants located in the Hyades. We analysed time-series data from both ground and space to perform the asteroseismic analysis. By combining high signal-to-noise (S/N) radial-velocity data from the ground-based SONG network with continuous space-based data from the revised Kepler mission K2, we derive and characterize 27 individual oscillation modes for epsilon Tau, along with global oscillation parameters such as the large frequency separation and the ratio between the amplitude of the oscillations measured in radial velocity and intensity as a function of frequency. The latter has been measured previously for only two stars, the Sun and Procyon. Combining the seismic analysis with interferometric and spectroscopic measurements, we derive physical parameters for epsilon Tau, and discuss its evolutionary status.",2019,[],5
1909.01454,astro-ph,"We have conducted a highly sensitive census of the evolved-star population in the metal-poor dwarf galaxy Leo P and detected four asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star candidates. Leo P is one of the best examples of a nearby analog of high-redshift galaxies because of its primitive metal content (2% of the solar value), proximity, and isolated nature, ensuring a less complicated history. Using medium-band optical photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we have classified the AGB candidates by their chemical type. We have identified one oxygen-rich source which appears to be dusty in both the HST and Spitzer observations. Its brightness, however, suggests it may be a planetary nebula or post-AGB object. We have also identified three carbon-rich candidates, one of which may be dusty. Follow-up observations are needed to confirm the nature of these sources and to study the composition of any dust that they produce. If dust is confirmed, these stars would likely be among the most metal-poor examples of dust-producing stars known and will provide valuable insight into our understanding of dust formation at high redshift.",2019,[],5

We demonstrate how model independent statistical methods, specifically Gaussian process regression, can remove bias in the reconstruction of equation, and can be combined model independently with supernova distances. This allows stringent tests of both equation and equationCDM, and can detect unrecognized systematics. We also quantify the redshift systematic control necessary for the use of dark sirens, showing that it must approach spectroscopic precision to avoid significant bias.",2019,[],5
1912.01681,astro-ph,"Symbiotic binary AG~Draconis (AG~Dra) has an well-established outburst behavior based on an extensive observational history. Usually, the system undergoes a 9--15~yr period of quiescence with a constant average energy emitted, during which the system's orbital period of equation550~d can be seen at shorter wavelengths (particularly in the U-band) as well as a shorter period of equation355~d thought to be due to pulsations of the cool component. After a quiescent period, the marker of an active period is usually a major (cool) outburst of up to equation~mag, followed by a series of minor (hot) outbursts repeating at a period of approximately 1~yr. However, in 2016 April after a 9-year period of quiescence AG~Dra exhibited unusual behavior: it began an active phase with a minor outburst followed by two more minor outbursts repeating at an interval of equation1~yr. We present R-band observations of AG~Dra's 2018 April minor outburst and an analysis of the outburst mechanism and reports on the system's activity levels following the time of its next expected outburst. By considering the brightening and cooling times, the scale of the outburst, and its temperature evolution we have determined that this outburst was of disk instability nature.",2019,[],5
1907.02083,astro-ph,"Observations with modern instruments such as Herschel reveal that stars form clustered inside filamentary arms of ~1 pc length embedded in Giant Molecular Clouds. On smaller scales (~1000 au), observations of, e.g., IRAS 16293--2422 show signs of filamentary `bridge' structures connecting young protostars in their birth environment. We investigate the formation of a deeply embedded triple protostellar system, and characterize its connection to the filamentary structure present on GMC scales. Using the magnetohydrodynamical code RAMSES, we carry out zoom-in simulations of low-mass star formation starting from Giant-Molecular-Cloud-scales. Colliding flows of gas in the filamentary arms induce the formation of two protostellar companions at distances of ~1000 au from the primary. After their birth, the stellar companions quickly (~10 kyr) approach and orbit the primary on eccentric orbits with separations of ~100 au. The colliding flows induce transient structures lasting for up to a few 10 kyr connecting two forming protostellar objects that are kinematically quiescent along the line-of-sight. Colliding flows compress the gas and trigger the formation of stellar companions via turbulent fragmentation. Our results suggest that protostellar companions form with a wide separation of ~1000 au. Smaller separations (~100 au or less) are a consequence of subsequent migration and capturing. Associated with the formation phase of the companion, the turbulent environment induces arc- and bridge-like structures. These bridges can become kinematically quiescent, when the velocity components of the colliding flows eliminate each other. However, the gas in bridges still contributes to stellar accretion later. Our results demonstrate: bridge-like structures are a transient phenomenon of stellar multiple formation.",2019,[],5

1902.07561,astro-ph,"Active galactic nuclei are the most luminous persistent (non-transient, even if often variable) objects in the Universe. They are bright in the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Blazars are a special class where the jets point nearly to our line of sight. Because of this special geometry and the bulk relativistic motion of the plasma in the jet, their radiation is enhanced by relativistic beaming. The majority of extragalactic objects detected in gamma-rays are blazars. However, finding their counterparts in other wavebands could be challenging. Here we present the results of our 5-GHz European VLBI Network (EVN) observation of the radio source J13312932, a candidate blazar found while searching for possible gamma-ray emission from the stellar binary system DG CVn (Loh et al. 2017).

1902.07195,astro-ph,"The innermost parts of powerful jets in active galactic nuclei are surrounded by dense, high-velocity clouds from the broad-line region, which may penetrate into the jet and lead to the formation of a strong shock. Such jet-cloud interactions are expected to have measurable effects on the equation-ray emission from blazars. We characterise the dynamics of a typical cloud-jet interaction scenario, and the evolution of its radiative output in the 0.1-30~GeV energy range, to assess to what extent these interactions can contribute to the equation-ray emission in blazars. We use semi-analytical descriptions of the jet-cloud dynamics, taking into account the expansion of the cloud inside the jet and its acceleration. Assuming that electrons are accelerated in the interaction and making use of the hydrodynamical information, we then compute the high-energy radiation from the cloud, including the absorption of equation-rays in the ambient photon field through pair creation. Jet-cloud interactions can lead to significant equation-ray fluxes in blazars with a broad-line region, in particular when the cloud expansion and acceleration inside the jet are taken into account. This is caused by 1) the increased shocked area in the jet, which leads to an increase in the energy budget for the non-thermal emission; 2) a more efficient inverse Compton cooling with the boosted photon field of the broad-line region; and 3) an increased observer luminosity due to Doppler boosting effects. For typical broad-line region parameters, either (i) jet-cloud interactions contribute significantly to the persistent equation-ray emission from blazars or (ii) the broad-line region is far from spherical or the fraction of energy deposited in non-thermal electrons is small.",2019,[],5
1904.12036,astro-ph,"We analyze the statistics of pulse arrival times in fast radio burst (FRB) 121102 and demonstrate that they are remarkably similar to statistics of magnetar high-energy short bursts. Motivated by this correspondence, we propose that repeating FRBs are generated during short bursts in the closed field line zone of magnetar magnetospheres via a pulsar-like emission mechanism. Crustal slippage events dislocate field line foot points, initiating intense particle acceleration and pair production, giving rise to coherent radio emission similar to that generated near pulsar polar caps. We argue that the energetics of FRB 121102 can be readily accounted for if the efficiency of the conversion of Poynting flux into coherent radio emission is equation, values consistent with empirical efficiencies of radio emission in pulsars and radio-loud magnetars. Such a mechanism could operate only in magnetars with preexisting low twist of the magnetosphere, so that the charge density in the closed zone is initially insufficient to screen the electric field provoked by the wiggling of magnetic field lines and is low enough to let equation GHz radio emission escape the magnetosphere, which can explain the absence of FRBs from known magnetars. The pair cascades crowd the closed flux tubes with plasma, screening the accelerating electric field, thus limiting the radio pulse duration to equation ms. Within the framework of our model, the current dataset of the polarization angle variation in FRB 121102 suggests a magnetic obliquity equation and viewing angle equation with respect to the spin axis equation.",2019,[],5
1904.07747,astro-ph,"We report on the results of deep and wide-field (1.1 degequation) narrow-band observations with Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) of a field around a hyperluminous QSO (HLQSO), HS15491919, residing in a protocluster at equation, to map the large-scale structure of Lyequation emitters (LAEs). One HSC pointing enables us to detect 3490 LAEs and 76 extended Lyequation blobs (LABs), probing diverse environments from voids to protoclusters. The HLQSO is found to be near the center of the protocluster, which corresponds to the intersection of equation100 cMpc-scale structures of LAEs. LABs are basically distributed along the large-scale structure, with larger ones particularly clustered around the HLQSO, confirming a previously noted tendency of LABs to prefer denser environments. Moreover, the shapes of LABs near the HLQSO appear to be aligned with the large-scale structure. Finally, a deep Lyequation image reveals a diffuse Lyequation nebula along a filamentary structure with no luminous UV/sub-mm counterpart.

1909.00366,astro-ph,"We investigated the evolution of the background expansion and the growth rate of the matter density fluctuations in the scalar field equationCDM Ratra-Peebles model. We constrained the model parameter equation and the matter density parameter equation using the recent measurements of the growth rate of the matter density fluctuations and baryon acoustic oscillation peak position. In addition, we studied a number of the equationCDM scalar field models in order to determine whether or not it would be possible to discriminate them from the equationCDM model using predicted data for the future Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) observations. For this purpose, we carried out the statistical Bayesian analysis, and computed Bayes coefficients, as well as Akaike and Bayesian information criteria. We found that projected DESI results could provide compelling when comparing most equationCDM models with the equationCDM model. We also conducted the MCMC analysis and obtained the constraints on the parameters of the scalar field models, comparing the observational data for: the universe expansion rate, the angular diameter distance and the growth rate function, with the corresponding data generated for the equationCDM model.

1907.05263,astro-ph,"Over the last decade, the continuing decline in the cost of digital computing technology has brought about a dramatic transformation in how digital instrumentation for radio astronomy is developed and operated. In most cases, it is now possible to interface consumer computing hardware, e.g. inexpensive graphics processing units and storage devices, directly to the raw data streams produced by radio telescopes. Such systems bring with them myriad benefits: straightforward upgrade paths, cost savings through leveraging an economy of scale, and a lowered barrier to entry for scientists and engineers seeking to add new instrument capabilities. Additionally, the typical data-interconnect technology used with general-purpose computing hardware -- Ethernet -- naturally permits multiple subscribers to a single raw data stream. This allows multiple science programs to be conducted in parallel. When combined with broad bandwidths and wide primary fields of view, radio telescopes become capable of achieving many science goals simultaneously. Moreover, because many science programs are not strongly dependent on observing cadence and direction (e.g. searches for extraterrestrial intelligence and radio transient surveys), these so-called ""commensal"" observing programs can dramatically increase the scientific productivity and discovery potential of an observatory. In this whitepaper, we detail a project to add an Ethernet-based commensal observing mode to the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), and discuss how this mode could be leveraged to conduct a powerful program to constrain the distribution of advanced life in the universe through a search for radio emission indicative of technology.

By analytically solving the improved Einstein-Boltzmann equation to include all perturbative contributions from the DM productions, we observe an amplified perturbative resonance that takes place between DM density perturbation and scalar modes of metric perturbation. As this perturbative resonance does not affect the tensor modes, it results in a suppression of the tensor-to-scalar ratio of metric perturbation equation. Then by using a typical reheating model to specify cosmic background, we establish an explicit relation between DM particle mass equation and equation. As equation will be further constrained in the coming round of primordial gravitational wave detections, equation would be constrained accordingly.",2019,[],5
1908.03534,astro-ph,"On 2014 March 29, an intense solar flare classified as X1.0 occurred in the active region 12017. Several associated phenomena accompanied this event, among them a fast-filament eruption, large-scale propagating disturbances in the corona and the chromosphere including a Moreton wave, and a coronal mass ejection. This flare was successfully detected in multiwavelength imaging in H-alpha line by the Flare Monitoring Telescope (FMT) at Ica University, Peru. We present a detailed study of the Moreton wave associated with the flare in question. Special attention is paid to the Doppler characteristics inferred from the FMT wing (H-alphaequation~\AA) observations, which are used to examine the downward/upward motion of the plasma in the chromosphere. Our findings reveal that the downward motion of the chromospheric material at the front of the Moreton wave attains a maximum velocity of 4 km/s, whereas the propagation speed ranges between 640 and 859 km/s. Furthermore, utilizing the weak shock approximation in conjunction with the velocity amplitude of the chromospheric motion induced by the Moreton wave, we derive the Mach number of the incident shock in the corona. We also performed the temperature-emission measure analysis of the coronal wave based on the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) observations, which allowed us to derive the compression ratio, and to estimate the Alfv\'en and fast-mode Mach numbers of the order of 1.06-1.28 and 1.05-1.27.

We present forecasted constraints from forthcoming and next-generation radio surveys. We show that, while SKA might be capable of a detection for some cases, the most promising opportunity to detect dark matter in the 21 cm intensity mapping signal is with a futuristic radio array on the lunar far-side, with the potential to detect a signal many orders of magnitude weaker than current or maximal constraints from other probes.",2019,[],5
1905.07921,astro-ph,"Empirical correlations between stellar parameters such as rotation or radius and magnetic activity diagnostics require estimates of the effective temperatures and the stellar radii. The aim of this study is to propose simple methods that can be applied to large samples of stars in order to derive estimates of the stellar parameters.   Good empirical correlations between Red/Infra-Red colours (e.g. (R-I)equation) and effective temperatures have been well established for a long time (e.g. Veeder 1974, Bessell 1979, Leggett 1992). The more recent (R-I)equation colour-equation correlation using the data of Mann et al. (2015: hereafter M15) and Boyajian et al. (2012: hereafter B12) shows that this colour can be applied as a temperature estimate for large samples of stars. We find that the mean scatter in equation relative to the (R-I)equation-equation relationship of B12 and M15 data is only equation44.6~K for K dwarfs and equation39.4~K for M dwarfs. These figures are small and show that the (R-I)equation colour can be used as a first guess effective temperature estimator for K and M dwarfs.   We derive effective temperatures for about 1910 K and M dwarfs using the calibration of (R-I)equation colour-equation from B12 and M15 data.

1910.00808,astro-ph,"Large galaxies grow through the accumulation of dwarf galaxies. In principle it is possible to trace this growth history using the properties of a galaxy's stellar halo. Previous investigations of the galaxy M31 (Andromeda) have shown that outside a radius of 25 kpc the population of halo globular clusters is rotating in alignment with the stellar disk, as are more centrally located clusters. The M31 halo also contains coherent stellar substructures, along with a smoothly distributed stellar component. Many of the globular clusters outside 25 kpc are associated with the most prominent substructures, while others are part of the smooth halo. Here we report a new analysis of the kinematics of these globular clusters. We find that the two distinct populations are rotating with perpendicular orientations. The rotation axis for the population associated with the smooth halo is aligned with the rotation axis for the plane of dwarf galaxies that encircles M31.

The 21-cm background emerging during the cosmological Dark Ages, the era between hydrogen recombination and the formation of the first luminous sources (likely at z ~ 30), is difficult to measure but provides several powerful advantages for these purposes: in addition to the lack of astrophysical contamination, it will allow probes of very small scale structure over a very large volume. Additionally, the 21-cm background is sensitive to the thermal state of the intergalactic hydrogen and therefore probes any exotic processes (including, e.g., dark matter scattering or decay and primordial black holes) during that era. After astrophysical sources have formed, cosmological information can be separated from astrophysical effects on the 21-cm background through methods such as redshift space distortions, joint modeling, and by searching for indirect effects on the astrophysical sources themselves.",2019,[],5

The models have all an analytical solution, and thus allow to understand easily the dependence of the strain on the star's main physical quantities, such as radius, mass and crust thickness. In the first 'historical' model the star is assumed to be comprised of a fluid core and an elastic crust with the same density. We compare the response of stars with different masses and equations of state to a decreasing centrifugal force, finding smaller deformations for heavier stars: the strain angle is peaked at the equator and turns out to be a decreasing function of the mass.We introduce a second, more refined, model in which the core and the crust have different densities and the gravitational potential of the deformed body is self-consistently accounted for. Also in this case the strain angle is a decreasing function of the stellar mass, but its maximum value is at the poles and is always larger than the corresponding one in the one-density model by a factor of two. Finally, within the present analytic approach, it is possible to estimate easily the impact of the Cowling approximation: neglecting the perturbations of the gravitational potential, the strain angle is 40\% of the one obtained with the complete model.",2019,[],5
1907.04026,astro-ph,"We test the recently proposed (Mediavilla et al. 2018) black hole mass scaling relationship based on the redshift with respect to the quasar's rest frame of the Fe IIIequation2039-2113 line blend. To this end, we fit this feature in the spectra of a well suited sample of quasars, observed with X-shooter at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), whose masses have been independently estimated using the virial theorem. For the quasars of this sample we consistently confirm the redshift of the Fe IIIequation2039-2113 blend and find that it correlates with the squared widths of Hequation, Hequation and Mg II, which are commonly used as a measure of equation to determine masses from the virial theorem. The average differences between virial and Fe IIIequation2039-2113 redshift based masses are 0.18equation dex, 0.18equation dex and 0.14equation dex, when the full widths at half maximum (FWHM) of the Hequation, Hequation and MgII lines are, respectively, used. The difference is reduced to 0.10equation dex when the standard deviation, equation, of the MgII line is used, instead. We also study the high S/N composite quasar spectra of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), finding that the Fe IIIequation2039-2113 redshifts and Mg II squared widths, equation, match very well the correlation found for the individual quasar spectra observed with X-shooter. This correlation is expected if the redshift is gravitational.",2019,[],5
1906.05844,astro-ph,"Planets in the ""Habitable Zones"" around M-type stars are important targets for characterization in future observations. Due to tidal-locking in synchronous spin-orbit rotations, the planets tend to have a hot dayside and a cold nightside. On the cold nightside, water vapor transferred from the dayside can be frozen in (""cold trap"") or the major atmospheric constituent could also condense (""atmospheric collapse"") if the atmosphere is so thin that the heat re-distribution is not efficient, in the case of a single M-type star. Motivated by the abundance of binary star systems, we investigate the effects of irradiation from a G-type companion star on the climate of a tidally locked planet around an M-type star using the 2D energy balance model. We find that the irradiation from the G-type star is more effective at warming up the nightside of the planet than the dayside. This contributes to the prevention of the irreversible trapping of water and atmosphere on the cold nightside, broadening the parameter space where tidally locked planets can maintain surface liquid water. Tidally locked ocean planets with < ~ 0.3 bar atmospheres or land planets with < ~ 3 bar atmospheres can realize temperate climate with surface liquid water when they are also irradiated by a companion star with a separation of 1 - 4 au. We also demonstrate that planets with given properties can be in the Earth-like temperate climate regime or in a completely frozen state under the same total irradiation.",2019,[],5
1904.07888,astro-ph,"We use the extended and updated OGLE Collection of Variable Stars to thoroughly analyze distribution of RR Lyrae stars in the Magellanic Bridge. We use photometric metallicities to derive absolute Wesenheit magnitude and then individual distance of each RR Lyr star. We confirm results from our earlier study showing that RR Lyr stars are present in between the Magellanic Clouds, though their three-dimensional distribution rather resembles two extended overlapping structures than a strict bridge-like connection. The contours do connect in the southern parts of the Bridge, albeit on a too low level to state that there exists an evident connection. To test the sample numerically, we use multi-Gaussian fitting and conclude that there is no additional population or overdensity located in the Bridge. We also try to reproduce results on putative RR Lyr Magellanic Bridge stream by selecting RR Lyr candidates from Gaia Data Release 1. We show that we are not able to obtain the evident connection of the Clouds without many spurious sources in the sample, as the cuts are not able to remove artifacts and not eliminate the evident connection at the same time. Moreover, for the first time we present the Gaia Data Release 2 RR Lyr stars in the Magellanic Bridge area and show that their distribution matches our results.",2019,[],5
1911.08910,astro-ph,"The structures of plasma flows in close binary systems whose accretors have strong intrinsic magnetic fields are studied. A close binary system with the parameters of a typical polar is considered. The results of three dimensional numerical simulations of the material flow from the donor into the accretor Roche lobe are presented. Special attention is given to the flow structure in the vicinity of the inner Lagrangian point, where the accretion flow is formed. The interaction of the accretion flow material from the envelope of the donor with the magnetic field of the accretor results in the formation of a hierarchical structure of the magnetosphere, because less dense areas of the accretion flow are captured by the magnetic field of the white dwarf earlier than more dense regions. Taking into account this kind of magnetosphere structure can affect analysis results and interpretation of the observations.",2019,[],5
1905.13661,astro-ph,"Using telescopes at the Canary Island observatories, we conducted the long-term observational programme 128-MULTIPLE-16/15B (LP15), a large and complete optical follow-up campaign of all the unidentified PSZ2 sources in the northern sky (Dec>-15 deg) and no correspondence in the first Planck catalogue PSZ1. We perform this optical validation of SZ clusters in order to contribute to the characterization of the actual purity and completeness of full Our validation procedure combines this optical information with SZ emission as traced by the publicly available Planck Compton y-maps. The clusters counterparts are classified according to redshift, velocity dispersion and richness of the clusters. This paper presents the detailed study of 106 objects out of the LP15 sample, corresponding to all the observations carried out during the first year of the programme. We confirmed the optical counterpart for 41 new PSZ2 sources, being 31 of them validated using also velocity dispersion based on our spectroscopic information. This is the largest dataset of newly confirmed PSZ2 sources without any previous optical information. All the confirmed counterparts are rich structures (i.e. they show high velocity dispersion), and are well aligned with the nominal Planck coordinates (~70% of them are located at less than 3 arcmin distance). In total, 65 SZ sources are classified as unconfirmed, being 57 of them due to the absence of an optical over-density, and 8 of them due to a weak association with the observed SZ decrement. Most of the sources with no optical counterpart are located at low galactic latitudes and present strong galactic cirrus in the optical images, being the dust contamination the most probable explanation for their inclusion in the PSZ2 catalogue.",2019,[],5
1907.06655,astro-ph,"Theoretical studies suggest that a giant planet around the young star MWC 758 could be responsible for driving the spiral features in its circumstellar disk. Here, we present a deep imaging campaign with the Large Binocular Telescope with the primary goal of imaging the predicted planet. We present images of the disk in two epochs in the equation filter (3.8 equation) and a third epoch in the equation filter (4.8 equation). The two prominent spiral arms are detected in each observation, which constitute the first images of the disk at equation, and the deepest yet in equation (equation12.1 exterior to the disk at 5equation significance). We report the detection of a S/Nequation3.9 source near the end of the Sourthern arm, and, from the source's detection at a consistent position and brightness during multiple epochs, we establish a equation90% confidence-level that the source is of astrophysical origin. We discuss the possibilities that this feature may be a) an unresolved disk feature, and b) a giant planet responsible for the spiral arms, with several arguments pointing in favor of the latter scenario. We present additional detection limits on companions exterior to the spiral arms, which suggest that a equation4 Mequation planet exterior to the spiral arms could have escaped detection. Finally, we do not detect the companion candidate interior to the spiral arms reported recently by Reggiani et al. (2018), although forward modelling suggests that such a source would have likely been detected.",2019,[],5
1911.04366,astro-ph,"We report the discovery of TOI 263.01 (TIC 120916706), a transiting substellar object (R = 0.87 RJup) orbiting a faint M3.5~V dwarf (V=18.97) on a 0.56~d orbit. We set out to determine the nature of the TESS planet candidate TOI 263.01 using ground-based multicolour transit photometry. The host star is faint, which makes RV confirmation challenging, but the large transit depth makes the candidate suitable for validation through multicolour photometry. Our analysis combines three transits observed simultaneously in r', i', and zs bands using the MuSCAT2 multicolour imager, three LCOGT-observed transit light curves in g, r', and i' bands, a TESS light curve from Sector 3, and a low-resolution spectrum for stellar characterisation observed with the ALFOSC spectrograph. We model the light curves with PyTransit using a transit model that includes a physics-based light contamination component that allows us to estimate the contamination from unresolved sources from the multicolour photometry. This allows us to derive the true planet-star radius ratio marginalised over the contamination allowed by the photometry, and, combined with the stellar radius, gives us a reliable estimate of the object's absolute radius. The ground-based photometry excludes contamination from unresolved sources with a significant colour difference to TOI 263. Further, contamination from sources of same stellar type as the host is constrained to levels where the true radius ratio posterior has a median of 0.217. The median radius ratio corresponds to an absolute planet radius of 0.87 RJup, which confirms the substellar nature of the planet candidate. The object is either a giant planet or a brown dwarf (BD) located deep inside the so-called ""brown dwarf desert"". Both possibilities offer a challenge to current planet/BD formation models and makes 263.01 an object deserving of in-depth follow-up studies.",2019,[],5
1906.03084,astro-ph,"The occurrence of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the gas phase at low temperature in the dense phases of the ISM suggests that a non-thermal desorption mechanism is at work because otherwise, COMs should condense within a short timescale onto dust grains. Vacuum ultraviolet photodesorption has been shown to be much less efficient for complex organic molecules, such as methanol, because mostly photoproducts are ejected. The induced photolysis competes with photodesorption for large COMs, considerably lowering the efficiency to desorb intact molecules. We investigate the sputtering efficiency of complex organic molecules that are observed either in the ice mantles of interstellar dense clouds directly by infrared spectroscopy (CH3OH), or that are observed in the gas phase by millimeter telescopes (CH3COOCH3) and that could be released from interstellar grain surfaces. We irradiated ice films containing complex organic molecules (methanol and methyl acetate) and water with swift heavy ions in the electronic sputtering regime. We monitored the infrared spectra of the film as well as the species released to the gas phase with a mass spectrometer. We demonstrate that when methanol or methyl acetate is embedded in a water-ice mantle exposed to cosmic rays, a large portion is sputtered as an intact molecule, with a sputtering yield close to that of the main water-ice matrix. This must be even more true for more volatile ice matrices, such as those that are embedded in carbon monoxide. Cosmic rays penetrating deep into dense clouds provide an efficient mechanism to desorb complex organic molecules. Compared to VUV photons induced by the interaction of cosmic rays, a large portion desorb as intact molecules with a proportion corresponding to the time-dependent bulk composition of the ice mantle, the latter evolving with time as a function of fluence due to the radiolysis of the bulk.",2019,[],5
1906.01623,astro-ph,"We study the spin alignment of galaxies and halos with respect to filaments and walls of the cosmic web, identified with DisPerSE, using the SIMBA simulation from z=0-2. Massive halos' spins are oriented perpendicularly to their closest filament's axis and walls, while low mass halos tend to have their spins parallel to filaments and in the plane of walls. A similar mass-dependent spin flip is found for galaxies, albeit with a weaker signal particularly at low mass and low-z, suggesting that galaxies' spins retain memory of their larger-scale environment. Low-z star-forming and rotation-dominated galaxies tend to have spins parallel to nearby filaments, while quiescent and dispersion-dominated galaxies show preferentially perpendicular orientation; the star formation trend can be fully explained by the stellar mass correlation, but the morphology trend cannot. There is a strong dependence on HI mass, such that high-HI galaxies tend to have parallel spins while low-HI galaxies are perpendicular, which persists even when matching samples in stellar mass, suggesting that HI content traces anisotropic infall more faithfully than the stellar component. Finally, at fixed stellar mass, the strength of spin alignments correlates with the filament's density, with parallel alignment for galaxies in high density environments. These findings are consistent with conditional tidal torque theory, and highlight a significant correlation between galactic spin and the larger scale tides that are important e.g. for interpreting weak lensing studies. SIMBA allows us to rule out numerical grid locking as the cause of previously-seen low mass alignment.",2019,[],5

With Zeeman-Doppler Imaging, we reconstruct the surface brightness and magnetic field of V410 Tau, and show that the star is heavily spotted and possesses a ~550 G relatively toroidal magnetic field.   We find that V410 Tau features a weak level of surface differential rotation between the equator and pole ~5 times weaker than the solar differential rotation. The spectropolarimetric data exhibit intrinsic variability, beyond differential rotation, which points towards a dynamo-generated field rather than a fossil field. Long-term variations in the photometric data suggest that spots appear at increasing latitudes over the span of our dataset, implying that, if V410 Tau has a magnetic cycle, it would have a period of more than 8 years.   Having derived raw radial velocities (RVs) from our spectra, we filter out the stellar activity jitter, modeled either from our Doppler maps or using Gaussian Process Regression. Thus filtered, our RVs exclude the presence of a hot Jupiter-mass companion below ~0.1 au, which is suggestive that hot Jupiter formation may be inhibited by the early depletion of the circumstellar disc, which for V410 Tau may have been caused by the close (few tens of au) M dwarf stellar companion.",2019,[],5
1908.09396,astro-ph,"We report the discovery of a secondary pair of radio lobes in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 2639 with polarization-sensitive observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). The presence of these lobes, which are aligned nearly perpendicular to the known set of radio lobes observed in the east-west direction, has not been reported previously in the literature. The in-band rotation measure image shows gradients in both the lobes indicative of organised magnetic field structures on kpc-scales. The magnetic field structure is aligned with the jet/lobe direction in both the lobes. Based on the settled optical morphology of the host galaxy, it is likely that a minor merger that did not disrupt the host galaxy structure is responsible for the observed features in NGC 2639. This also explains the near 90equation change in the jet direction; the current jet direction being the result of a new accretion disk formed by the minor merger, whose direction was a result of the angular momentum of the inflowing merger gas.",2019,[],5
1912.03986,astro-ph,"We present updated constraints on the variation of the fine structure constant, equation, and effective electron rest mass, equation, during the cosmological recombination era. These two fundamental constants directly affect the ionization history at redshift equation and thus modify the temperature and polarisation anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) measured precisely with \it Planck . The constraints on equation tighten slightly due to improved \it Planck 2018 polarisation data but otherwise remain similar to previous CMB analysis. However, a comparison with the 2015 constraints reveals a mildly discordant behaviour for equation, which from CMB data alone is found below its local value. Adding baryon acoustic oscillation data brings equation back to the fiducial value, equation, and also drives the Hubble parameter to equation [in units of equation]. Further adding supernova data yields equation with equation. We perform several comparative analyses using the latest cosmological recombination calculations to further understand the various effects. Our results indicate that a single-parameter extension allowing for a slightly increased value of equation (equation above equation) could play a role in the Hubble tension.",2019,[],5

Here we develop a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) relaxation method that reconstructs the solar atmospheric (chromospheric and coronal) magnetic field as a non-force-free magnetic field (NFFF) in magnetohydrostatic equilibrium where the Lorentz, pressure gradient, and gravitational forces are balanced. The system of basic equations for the MHD relaxation method is derived, and mathematical properties of the system are investigated.

Two-dimensional numerical experiments that include the pressure gradient and gravitational forces are also demonstrated.",2019,[],5
1909.04583,astro-ph,"We simulate the evolution of binary systems with a massive primary star of 15Mo where we introduce an enhanced mass loss due to jets that the secondary star might launch, and find that in many cases the enhanced mass loss brings the binary system to experience the grazing envelope evolution (GEE) and form a progenitor of Type IIb supernova (SN IIb). The jets, the Roche lobe overflow (RLOF), and a final stellar wind remove most of the hydrogen-rich envelope, leaving a blue-compact SN IIb progenitor. In many cases without this jet-driven mass loss the system enters a common envelope evolution (CEE) and does not form a SN IIb progenitor. We use the stellar evolutionary code MESA binary and mimic the jet-driven mass loss with a simple prescription and some free parameters. Our results show that the jet-driven mass loss, that some systems have during the GEE, increases the parameter space for stellar binary systems to form SN IIb progenitors. We estimate that the binary evolution channel with GEE contributes about a quarter of all SNe IIb, about equal to the contribution of each of the other three channels, binary evolution without a GEE, fatal CEE (where the secondary star merges with the core of the giant primary star), and the single star channel.",2019,[],5

For the maximum redshift of equation, the ten-year upper limit of luminosity is equation erg sequation. We utilize these upper limits to constrain the FRB progenitor and central engine. For the rotation-powered young magnetar model, the upper limits can pose constraints on the allowed parameter space for the initial rotational period and surface magnetic field of the magnetar. We also place significant constraints on the kinetic energy of a relativistic external shock wave, ruling out the possibility that there existed a gamma-ray burst (GRB) beaming towards earth during the past ten years as the progenitor of the repeater. The case of an off-beam GRB is also constrained if the viewing angle is not much greater than the jet opening angle.

1909.13107,astro-ph,"Context. Polarimetric imaging is one of the most effective techniques for high-contrast imaging and characterization of protoplanetary disks, and has the potential to be instrumental in characterizing exoplanets. VLT/SPHERE contains the InfraRed Dual-band Imager and Spectrograph (IRDIS) with a dual-beam polarimetric imaging (DPI) mode, which offers the capability to obtain linear polarization images at high contrast and resolution. Aims. We aim to provide an overview of IRDIS/DPI and study its optical design to improve observing strategies and data reduction. Methods. For H-band observations of TW Hya, we compare two data reduction methods that correct for instrumental polarization effects in different ways: a minimization of the noise image, and a polarimetric-model-based correction method that we present in Paper II of this study. Results. We use observations of TW Hya to illustrate the data reduction. In the images of the protoplanetary disk around this star we detect variability in the polarized intensity and angle of linear polarization with pointing-dependent instrument configuration. We explain these variations as instrumental polarization effects and correct for these effects using our model-based correction method. Conclusions. IRDIS/DPI has proven to be a very successful and productive high-contrast polarimetric imaging system. However, the instrument performance depends on the specific instrument configuration. We suggest adjustments to future observing strategies to optimize polarimetric efficiency in field tracking mode by avoiding unfavourable derotator angles. We recommend reducing on-sky data with the pipeline called IRDAP that includes the model-based correction method (described in Paper II) to optimally account for the remaining telescope and instrumental polarization effects and to retrieve the true polarization state of the incident light.",2019,[],5

This RF-only capability is predicated on novel techniques for Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) identification and mitigation with an analysis efficiency of 45\% for shower-driven events with a Signal-to-noise ratio equation 5 against the galactic background noise power of individual antennas. This technique enables more efficient detection of cosmic rays over a wider range of zenith angles than possible via triggers from in-situ particle detectors and can be easily adapted by neutrino experiments relying on RF-only detection.

High-time resolution recordings in different filters have been acquired for several occultations taken from January 2016 through January 2018 with Aqueye at the Copernicus telescope and Iqueye at the Galileo telescope in Asiago, Italy. Light curves with different time bins were calculated in post-processing and analyzed using a least-square model-dependent method.

A disappearance of Alf Tau shows an angular diameter in good agreement with literature values. The other stars were found to be unresolved, at the milliarcsecond level. We discuss the unique properties of Aqueye and Iqueye for this kind of observations, namely the simultaneous measurement in up to four different filters thanks to pupil splitting, and the unprecedented time resolution well exceeding the microsecond level.

1905.11335,astro-ph,"The central region of a circumstellar disk is difficult to resolve in global numerical simulations of collapsing cloud cores, but its effect on the evolution of the entire disk can be significant. We use numerical hydrodynamics simulations to model the long-term evolution of self-gravitating and viscous circumstellar disks in the thin-disk limit. Simulations start from the gravitational collapse of prestellar cores of 0.5--1.0~equation and both gaseous and dusty subsystems were considered, including a model for dust growth. The inner unresolved 1.0 au of the disk is replaced with a central ""smart"" cell (CSC) -- a simplified model that simulates physical processes that may occur in this region. We found that the mass transport rate through the CSC has an appreciable effect on the evolution of the entire disk. Models with slow mass transport form more massive and warmer disks and they are more susceptible to gravitational instability and fragmentation, including a newly identified episodic mode of disk fragmentation in the T Tauri phase of disk evolution. Models with slow mass transport through the CSC feature episodic accretion and luminosity bursts in the early evolution, while models with fast transport are characterized by a steadily declining accretion rate with low-amplitude flickering. Dust grows to a larger, decimeter size in the slow transport models and efficiently drifts in the CSC, where it accumulates reaching the limit when streaming instability becomes operational. We argue that gravitational instability, together with streaming instability likely operating in the inner disk regions, constitute two concurrent planet-forming mechanisms, which may explain the observed diversity of exoplanetary orbits (Abridged).",2019,[],5
1904.05894,astro-ph,"The strong observed clustering of equation quasars indicates they are hosted by massive (equation) dark matter halos. Assuming quasars and galaxies trace the same large-scale structures, this should also manifest as strong clustering of galaxies around quasars. Previous work on high-redshift quasar environments, mostly focused at equation, have failed to find convincing evidence for these overdensities. Here we conduct a survey for Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) in the environs of 17 quasars at equation probing scales of equation. We measure an average LAE overdensity around quasars of 1.4 for our full sample, which we quantify by fitting the quasar-LAE cross-correlation function. We find consistency with a power-law shape with correlation length of equation for a fixed slope of equation. We also measure the LAE auto-correlation length and find equation\,cMpc (equation), which is equation times higher than the value measured in blank fields. Taken together our results clearly indicate that LAEs are significantly clustered around equation quasars. We compare the observed clustering with the expectation from a deterministic bias model, whereby LAEs and quasars probe the same underlying dark matter overdensities, and find that our measurements fall short of the predicted overdensities by a factor of 2.1. We discuss possible explanations for this discrepancy including large-scale quenching or the presence of excess dust in galaxies near quasars.

1906.01382,astro-ph,"There remain many open questions relating to the depletion of elements into dust, e.g., exactly how are C and O incorporated into dust in dense clouds and, in particular, what drives the disappearance of oxygen in the denser interstellar medium? This work is, in part, an attempt to explain the apparently anomalous incorporation of O atoms into dust in dense clouds. We re-visit the question of the depletion of the elements incorporated into the carbonaceous component of interstellar dust, i.e., C, H, O, N and S, in the light of recent analyses of the organics in comets, meteorites and interplanetary dust particles. We find that oxygen could be combined with ~ 10 to 20 % of the carbon in the dust in dense regions in the form of a difficult to observe, organic carbonate, which could explain the unaccounted for 170-255 ppm oxygen depletion. We conclude that, while C, O and N atoms are depleted into an amorphous a-C:H:O:N phase, we posit that a significant fraction of C and O atoms could be sequestered into an organic carbonate, which provides a viable solution to the oxygen depletion problem.

Our objects, originally discovered through a wide-field optical survey with the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP), have the lowest luminosities (-25.5< M1450<-23.1 mag) of the z>5.8 quasars with measured black hole masses. From single-epoch mass measurements based on MgII2798, we find a wide range in black hole masses, from MBH=107.6 to 109.3 Msun. The Eddington ratios Lbol/LEdd range from 0.16 to 1.1, but the majority of the HSC quasars are powered by MBH=109 Msun supermassive black holes (SMBHs) accreting at sub-Eddington rates. The Eddington ratio distribution of the HSC quasars is inclined to lower accretion rates than those of Willott et al. (2010a), who measured the black hole masses for similarly faint z=6 quasars. This suggests that the global Eddington ratio distribution is wider than has previously been thought. The presence of MBH=109 Msun SMBHs at z=6 cannot be explained with constant sub-Eddington accretion from stellar remnant seed black holes. Therefore, we may be witnessing the first buildup of the most massive black holes in the first billion years of the universe, the accretion activity of which is transforming from active growth to a quiescent phase.

1903.08657,astro-ph,"We present an updated model of the cosmic ionizing background from the UV to the X-rays. Relative to our previous model (Faucher-Giguere et al. 2009), the new model provides a better match to a large number of up-to-date empirical constraints, including: 1) new galaxy and AGN luminosity functions; 2) stellar spectra including binary stars; 3) obscured and unobscured AGN; 4) a measurement of the non-ionizing UV background; 5) measurements of the intergalactic HI and HeII photoionization rates at z~0-6; 6) the local X-ray background; and 7) improved measurements of the intergalactic opacity. In this model, AGN dominate the HI ionizing background at z<~3 and star-forming galaxies dominate it at higher redshifts. Combined with the steeply declining AGN luminosity function beyond z~2, the slow evolution of the HI ionization rate inferred from the high-redshift HI Lya forest requires an escape fraction from star-forming galaxies that increases with redshift (a population-averaged escape fraction of ~1% suffices to ionize the intergalactic medium at z=3 when including the contribution from AGN). We provide effective photoionization and photoheating rates calibrated to match the Planck 2018 reionization optical depth and recent constraints from the HeII Lya forest in hydrodynamic simulations.",2019,[],5
1912.00560,astro-ph,"Optical periodicity QSOs found by transient surveys are suggested to be sub-parsec supermassive binary black holes (BBHs). An intriguing interpretation for the periodicity of some of those QSOs is that the continuum is radiated from the accretion disk associated with the BBH secondary component and modulated by the periodical rotation of the secondary via Doppler-boost effect. Close to edge-on orbital orientation can lead to more significant Doppler-boost effect and thus are preferred for these systems, which is distinct from those normal type-1 QSOs with more or less face-on orientations. Therefore, the profiles of broad lines emitted from these Doppler-modulated systems may be significantly different from other systems that are not Doppler-modulated. We investigate the properties of the broad emission lines of optical-periodicity QSOs, including both a sample of QSOs that can be interpreted by the Doppler-modulated effects and a sample that cannot. We find that there is no obvious difference in the profiles and other properties of various (stacked) broad emission lines of these two samples, though a simple broad line region model would suggest significant differences. Our finding raises a challenge to the Doppler boost hypothesis for some of those BBHs candidates with optical periodicity.",2019,[],5
1902.08635,astro-ph,"We present an unprecedented, deep study of the primordial low-mass X-ray binary population in an isolated, lower-metallicity environment. We perform followup observations of previously-identified X-ray binary candidates in the Sculptor Dwarf Galaxy by combining a second Chandra observation with Spitzer and Gemini photometry, as well as Gemini spectroscopy of selected targets. Of the original nine bright X-ray sources identified, we are able to classify all but one as quasars, active galactic nuclei, or background galaxies. We further discover four new X-ray sources in the second-epoch Chandra observation. Three of these new sources are background sources and one is a foreground flaring star. We have found that Sculptor is effectively devoid of X-ray sources above a few 1e34 erg/s. If Sculptor is able to retain primordial binaries at a similar rate to globular clusters, this implies that bright X-ray binaries observed in globular clusters in the present epoch are all formed dynamically.",2019,[],5
1905.03844,astro-ph,"The detection of gas in debris disks raises the question of whether this gas is a remnant from the primordial protoplanetary phase, or released by the collision of secondary bodies. In this paper we analyze ALMA observations at 1-1.5"" resolution of three debris disks where the equationCO(2-1) rotational line was detected: HD131835, HD138813, and HD156623. We apply the iterative Lucy-Richardson deconvolution technique to the problem of circumstellar disks to derive disk geometries and surface brightness distributions of the gas. The derived disk parameters are used as input for thermochemical models to test both primordial and cometary scenarios for the origin of the gas. We favor a secondary origin for the gas in these disks and find that the CO gas masses (equation Mequation) require production rates (equation Mequation~yrequation) similar to those estimated for the bona-fide gas rich debris disk equation Pic.",2019,[],5
2001.00049,astro-ph,"With the first observations of debris disks as well as proposed planets around white dwarfs, the question of how rocky planets around such stellar remnants can be characterized and probed for signs of life becomes tangible. White dwarfs are similar in size to Earth and have relatively stable environments for billions of years after initial cooling, making them intriguing targets for exoplanet searches and terrestrial planet atmospheric characterization. Their small size and the resulting large planet transit signal allows observations with next generation telescopes to probe the atmosphere of such rocky planets, if they exist. We model high-resolution transmission spectra for planets orbiting white dwarfs from as they cool from 6,000-4,000 K, for i) planets receiving equivalent irradiation to modern Earth, and ii) planets orbiting at the distance around a cooling white dwarf which allows for the longest continuous time in the habitable zone.

1912.06377,astro-ph,"We use the moving-mesh code AREPO to investigate the effects of different levels of rotation and turbulence on the fragmentation of primordial gas and the formation of Population III stars. We consider 9 different combinations of turbulence and rotation and carry out 5 different realizations of each setup, yielding one of the largest sets of simulations of Population III star formation ever performed. We find that fragmentation in Population III star-forming systems is a highly chaotic process and show that the outcomes of individual realizations of the same initial conditions often vary significantly. However, some general trends are apparent. Increasing the turbulent energy promotes fragmentation, while increasing the rotational energy inhibits fragmentation. Within the 1000 yr period that we simulate, runs including turbulence yield flat protostellar mass functions while purely rotational runs show a more top-heavy distribution. The masses of the individual protostars are distributed over a wide range from a few equation to several tens of equation. The total mass growth rate of the stellar systems remains high throughout the simulations and depends only weakly on the degree of rotation and turbulence. Mergers between protostars are common, but predictions of the merger fraction are highly sensitive to the criterion used to decide whether two protostars should merge. Previous studies of Population III star formation have often considered only one realization per set of initial conditions. However, our results demonstrate that robust trends can only be reliably identified by considering averages over a larger sample of runs.",2019,[],5
1908.07496,astro-ph,"The cosmological reionization can be studied in the radio through the tomographic view offered by the redshifted 21-cm line and the integrated information carried out by the diffuse free-free emission, coupled to the Comptonization distortion, relevant at higher frequencies. Current predictions span a wide range of possibilities, while the recent EDGES observations disagree with the standard models and call, if confirmed, for non-standard physical processes and/or for an early population of extragalactic sources producing a remarkable background at high redshifts almost consistent with the ARCADE 2 claim of a significant excess of CMB absolute temperature at low frequency. These signatures can be observed in global signal and fluctuations, from very large to small angular scales. The observer peculiar motion with respect to a reference frame in rest with respect to the CMB produces boosting effects in various observable quantities, remarkable at low multipoles, and particularly in the dipole, with frequency spectral behaviours depending on the monopole emission spectrum. We present a novel investigation at radio frequencies, aimed at predicting the imprints expected in the redshifted 21-cm line signal and in the diffuse free-free emission plus the Comptonization distortion for several models. Furthermore, we consider the same type of signal but expected from the cosmological radio background determining the offset for 21-cm line. The combination of these signals and their relevance in the various frequency ranges are studied. This approach, linking monopole and anisotropy analyses, can be applied on wide sky coverage surveys as well as to sets of sky patches. Relying only on the quality of interfrequency and relative data calibration, it in principle by-passes the need for precise absolute calibration, a critical point of current and future radio interferometric facilities.",2019,[],5
1905.00617,astro-ph,"The inter-line comparison between high- and low-ionization emission lines has yielded a wealth of information on the quasar broad line region (BLR) structure and dynamics, including perhaps the earliest unambiguous evidence in favor of a disk  wind structure in radio-quiet quasars. We carried out an analysis of the CIV 1549 and Hbeta line profiles of 28 Hamburg-ESO high luminosity quasars and of 48 low-z, low luminosity sources in order to test whether the high-ionization line CIV 1549 width could be correlated with Hbeta and be used as a virial broadening estimator. We analyze intermediate- to high-S/N, moderate resolution optical and NIR spectra covering the redshifted CIV and Hequation over a broad range of luminosity log L ~ 44 - 48.5 [erg/s] and redshift (0 - 3), following an approach based on the quasar main sequence. The present analysis indicates that the line width of CIV 1549 is not immediately offering a virial broadening estimator equivalent to Hequation. At the same time a virialized part of the BLR appears to be preserved even at the highest luminosities. We suggest a correction to FWHM(CIV) for Eddington ratio (using the CIV blueshift as a proxy) and luminosity effects that can be applied over more than four dex in luminosity. Great care should be used in estimating high-L black hole masses from CIV 1549 line width. However, once corrected FWHM(CIV) values are used, a CIV-based scaling law can yield unbiased MBH values with respect to the ones based on Hequation with sample standard deviation ~ 0.3 dex.",2019,[],5
1912.06659,astro-ph,"We explore the high spectral resolution X-ray data towards the quasar 3C273 to search for signals of hot (equation K) X-ray-absorbing gas co-located with two established intergalactic FUV OVI absorbers. We analyze the soft X-ray band grating data of all XMM-Newton and Chandra instruments to search for the hot phase absorption lines at the FUV predicted redshifts. The viability of potential line detections is examined by adopting the constraints of a physically justified absorption model. The WHIM hypothesis is investigated with a complementary 3D galaxy distribution analysis, and by comparison of the measurement results to the WHIM properties in the EAGLE cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation. At FUV redshift z=0.09017, we measured signals of two hot ion species, OVIII and NeIX, with a equation combined significance level. Considering the line features in all instruments collectively and assuming collisional equilibrium for absorbing gas, we were able to constrain the temperature (equation keV) and the column density (equation cmequation) of the absorber. Thermal analysis indicates that FUV and X-ray absorption relate to different phases, with estimated temperatures equation and equation K, which match the EAGLE predictions for WHIM at the FUV/X-ray measured equation-ranges. We detected a large scale galactic filament crossing the sightline at the redshift of the absorption, linking the absorption to this structure. This study provides insights into co-existing warm and hot gas within a WHIM filament and estimates the ratio of the hot and warm phases. Because the hot phase is thermally distinct from the OVI gas, the estimated baryon content of the absorber is increased, conveying the promise of X-ray follow-up studies of FUV detected WHIM in refining the picture of the missing baryons.",2019,[],5
1912.09192,astro-ph,"We examine the surface brightnesses of Saturn's smaller satellites using a photometric model that explicitly accounts for their elongated shapes and thus facilitates comparisons among different moons. Analyses of Cassini imaging data with this model reveals that the moons Aegaeon, Methone and Pallene are darker than one would expect given trends previously observed among the nearby mid-sized satellites. On the other hand, the trojan moons Calypso and Helene have substantially brighter surfaces than their co-orbital companions Tethys and Dione. These observations are inconsistent with the moons' surface brightnesses being entirely controlled by the local flux of E-ring particles, and therefore strongly imply that other phenomena are affecting their surface properties. The darkness of Aegaeon, Methone and Pallene is correlated with the fluxes of high-energy protons, implying that high-energy radiation is responsible for darkening these small moons. Meanwhile, Prometheus and Pandora appear to be brightened by their interactions with nearby dusty F ring, implying that enhanced dust fluxes are most likely responsible for Calypso's and Helene's excess brightness. However, there are no obvious structures in the E ring that would preferentially brighten these two moons, so there must either be something subtle in the E-ring particles' orbital properties that leads to asymmetries in the relevant fluxes, or something happened recently to temporarily increase these moons' brightnesses.",2019,[],5
1903.11069,astro-ph,"We investigate the baryon content of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) within the virial radius of equation haloes at z ~ 3, by modelling the surface brightness profile of the giant Lyequation nebulae recently discovered by MUSE around bright QSOs at this redshift. We initially assume fluorescent emission from cold photo-ionized gas confined by the pressure of a hot halo. Acceptable CGM baryon fractions (equal or smaller than the cosmological value) require that the cold gas occupies equation 1% of the volume, but is about as massive as the hot gas. CGM baryon fractions as low as 30% of the cosmic value, as predicted by some strongly ejective feedback models at this redshift, are not easy to reconcile with observations, under our assumptions, unless both the QSO-hosting haloes at equation are more massive than recent BOSS estimates based on clustering and the photo-ionized gas is colder than expected in a standard QSO ionizing radiation field. We also consider the option that the emission is dominated by photons scattered from the QSO broad line region. In this scenario, a very stringent lower limit to the baryon fraction can be obtained under the extreme assumption of optically thin scattering. We infer in this case a baryon fraction of at least 70% of the cosmic value, for fiducial parameters. Lower values require halo masses or gas temperatures different than expected, or that some mechanism keeps the cold gas systematically over-pressured with respect to the ambient medium.",2019,[],5

We find that 65% of sources in our sample show a disc density significantly higher than 1e15 cm-3, which was assumed in previous reflection-based spectral analyses. The best-fit disc densities show an anti-correlation with black hole mass and mass accretion rate. High density disc reflection model can successfully explain the soft excess emission and significantly reduce inferred iron abundances.

This represents the first detection of polarized millimeter emission in a equation-ray burst. We show that the optical and X-ray observations between equation days and equation days are consistent with a fast cooling forward shock expanding into a wind environment. However, the optical observations at equation days, as well as the radio and millimeter observations arise from a separate component, which we interpret as emission from the reverse-shocked ejecta. Using the measured linear polarization, we constrain the coherence scale of tangled magnetic fields in the ejecta to an angular size of equation radian, while the rotation of the polarization angle rules out the presence of large scale, ordered axisymmetric magnetic fields, and in particular a large scale toroidal field, in the jet.",2019,[],5

The inferred low mass ratio and location in the equation diagram suggest that GWAC\,181211A is a WZ sge-type dwarf novae candidate.

1904.01021,astro-ph,"Large spectroscopic surveys of the Milky Way have revealed that a small population of stars in the halo have light element abundances comparable to those found in globular clusters. The favoured explanation for the peculiar abundances of these stars is that they originated inside a globular cluster and were subsequently lost. Using orbit calculations we assess the likelihood that an existing sample of 57 field stars with globular cluster-like CN band strength originated in any of the currently known Milky Way globular clusters. Using Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Gaia data, we determine orbits and integrals of motion of our sample of field stars, and use these values and metallicity to identify likely matches to globular clusters. The pivot hypothesis is that had these stars been stripped from such objects, they would have remained on very similar orbits. We find that ~ 70% of the sample of field stars have orbital properties consistent with the halo of the Milky Way; however, only 20 stars have likely orbital associations with an existing globular cluster. The remaining ~ 30% of the sample have orbits that place them in the outer Galactic disc. No cluster of similar metallicity is known on analogous disc orbits. The orbital properties of the halo stars seem to be compatible with the globular cluster escapee scenario. The stars in the outer disc are particularly surprising and deserve further investigation to establish their nature.",2019,[],5
1910.12054,astro-ph,"M dwarfs host most of the exoplanets in the local Milky Way. Some of these planets, ranging from sub-Earths to super-Jupiters, orbit in their stars' habitable zones (HZs), although many likely possess surface environments that preclude habitability. Moreover, exomoons around these planets could harbor life for long timescales and thus may also be targets for biosignature surveys. Here we investigate the potential habitability, stability, and detectability of exomoons around exoplanets orbiting M dwarfs. We first compile an updated list of known M-dwarf exoplanet hosts, comprising 109 stars and 205 planets. For each M dwarf, we compute and update precise luminosities with the Virtual Observatory spectral energy distribution Analyzer and Gaia DR2 parallaxes to determine inner and outer boundaries of their HZs. For each planet, we retrieve (or, when necessary, homogeneously estimate) their masses and radii, calculate the long-term dynamical stability of hypothetical moons, and identify those planets that can support habitable moons.

1902.02708,astro-ph,"We present the largest survey of spectrally resolved mid-infrared water emission to date, with spectra for 11 disks obtained with the Michelle and TEXES spectrographs on Gemini North. Water emission is detected in 6 of 8 disks around classical T Tauri stars. Water emission is not detected in the transitional disks SR 24 N and SR 24 S, in spite of SR 24 S having pre-transitional disk properties like DoAr 44, which does show water emission (Salyk et al. 2015). With R~100,000, the TEXES water spectra have the highest spectral resolution possible at this time, and allow for detailed lineshape analysis. We find that the mid-IR water emission lines are similar to the ""narrow component"" in CO rovibrational emission (Banzatti & Pontoppidan 2015), consistent with disk radii of a few AU. The emission lines are either single peaked, or consistent with a double peak. Single-peaked emission lines cannot be produced with a Keplerian disk model, and may suggest that water participates in the disk winds proposed to explain single-peaked CO emission lines (Bast et al. 2011, Pontoppidan et al. 2011). Double-peaked emission lines can be used to determine the radius at which the line emission luminosity drops off. For HL Tau, the lower limit on this measured dropoff radius is consistent with the 13 AU dark ring (ALMA partnership et al. 2015). We also report variable line/continuum ratios from the disks around DR Tau and RW Aur, which we attribute to continuum changes and line flux changes, respectively. The reduction in RW Aur line flux corresponds with an observed dimming at visible wavelengths (Rodriguez et al. 2013).",2019,[],5
1902.01749,astro-ph,"(Abridged) The CASA software suite, can now reduce very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) data with the recent addition of a fringe fitter. Here, we present the Radboud PIpeline for the Calibration of high Angular Resolution Data (rPICARD), which is an open-source VLBI calibration and imaging pipeline built on top of the CASA framework. The pipeline is capable of reducing data from different VLBI arrays. It can be run non-interactively after only a few non-default input parameters are set and delivers high-quality calibrated data. CPU scalability based on a message-passing interface (MPI) implementation ensures that large bandwidth data from future arrays can be processed within reasonable computing times. Phase calibration is done with a Schwab-Cotton fringe fit algorithm. For the calibration of residual atmospheric effects, optimal solution intervals are determined based on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the data for each scan. Different solution intervals can be set for different antennas in the same scan to increase the number of detections in the low S/N regime. These novel techniques allow rPICARD to calibrate data from different arrays, including high-frequency and low-sensitivity arrays. The amplitude calibration is based on standard telescope metadata, and a robust algorithm can solve for atmospheric opacity attenuation in the high-frequency regime. Standard CASA tasks are used for CLEAN imaging and self-calibration. In this work we demonstrate the capabilities of rPICARD by calibrating and imaging 7 mm VLBA data of the central radio source in the M87 galaxy. The reconstructed jet image reveals a complex collimation profile and edge-brightened structure. A potential counter-jet is detected that has 10 % of the brightness of the approaching jet.

1912.10471,astro-ph,"In a cosmological setting, the disc of a galaxy is expected to continuously experience gravitational torques and perturbations from a variety of sources, which can cause the disc to wobble, flare and warp.

Our Milky Way presents a unique case study for galactic warps, thanks to the detailed knowledge of its stellar distribution and kinematics. Using a simple model of how the warp's orientation is changing with time, we here measure the precession rate of the Milky Way's warp using 12 million giant stars from Gaia Data Release 2, finding that it is precessing at equation km/s/kpc in the direction of Galactic rotation, about one third the angular velocity at the Sun's position in the Galaxy.

1912.02133,astro-ph,"We present a detailed analysis of a confined filament eruption and jet associated with a C1.5 class solar flare. Multi-wavelength observations from GONG and SDO reveal the filament forming over several days following the emergence and then partial cancellation of a minority polarity spot within a decaying bipolar active region. The emergence is also associated with the formation of a 3D null point separatrix that surrounds the minority polarity. The filament eruption occurs concurrent with brightenings adjacent to and below the filament, suggestive of breakout and flare reconnection, respectively. The erupting filament material becomes partially transferred into a strong outflow jet (~ 60 km/s) along coronal loops, becoming guided back towards the surface. Utilising high resolution Hequation observations from SST/CRISP, we construct velocity maps of the outflows demonstrating their highly structured but broadly helical nature. We contrast the observations with a 3D MHD simulation of a breakout jet in a closed-field background and find close qualitative agreement. We conclude that the suggested model provides an intuitive mechanism for transferring twist/helicity in confined filament eruptions, thus validating the applicability of the breakout model not only to jets and coronal mass ejections but also to confined eruptions and flares.",2019,[],5

To present the new novel statistical clustering tool 'INDICATE' which assesses and quantifies the degree of spatial clustering of each object in a dataset, discuss its applications as a tracer of morphological stellar features in star forming regions, and to look for these features in the Carina Nebula (NGC 3372).   Results. We successfully recover known stellar structure of the Carina Nebula, including the 5 young star clusters in this region. Four sub-clusters contain no, or very few, stars with a degree of association above random which suggests they may be fluctuations in the field rather than real clusters. In addition we find: (1) Stars in the NW and SE regions have significantly different clustering tendencies, which is reflective of differences in the apparent star formation activity in these regions. Further study is required to ascertain the physical origin of the difference; (2) The different clustering properties between these two regions are even more pronounced for OB stars; (3) There are no signatures of classical mass segregation present in the SE region - massive stars here are not spatially concentrated together above random; (4) Stellar concentrations are more frequent around massive stars than typical for the general population, particularly in the Tr14 cluster; (5) There is a relation between the concentration of OB stars and the concentration of (lower mass) stars around OB stars in the centrally concentrated Tr14 and Tr15, but no such relation exists in Tr16. We conclude this is due to the highly sub-structured nature of Tr16.   Conclusions.

1911.12434,astro-ph,"Knowledge of the midplane temperature of protoplanetary disks is one of the key ingredients in theories of dust growth and planet formation. However, direct measurement of this quantity is complicated, and often depends on the fitting of complex models to the data. In this paper we demonstrate a method to directly measure the midplane gas temperature from an optically thick molecular line, if the disk is moderately inclined. The only model assumption that enters is that the line is very optically thick, also in the midplane region where we wish to measure the temperature. Freeze-out of the molecule onto dust grains could thwart this. However, in regions that are expected to be warm enough to avoid freeze-out, this method should work. We apply the method to the CO 2-1 line channel maps of the disk around HD 163296. We find that the midplane temperature between 100 and 400 au drops only mildly from 25 K down to 18 K. While we see no direct evidence of the midplane being optically thin due to strong CO depletion by freeze-out, we cannot rule it out either. The fact that the inferred temperatures are close to the expected CO freeze-out temperature could be an indication of this. Incidently, for the disk around HD 163296 we also find dynamic evidence for a rather abrupt outer edge of the disk, suggestive of outside-in photoevaporation or truncation by an unseen companion.",2019,[],5
1909.10817,astro-ph,"Existing models of galaxy formation have not yet explained striking correlations between structure and star-formation activity in galaxies, notably the sloped and moving boundaries that divide star-forming from quenched galaxies in key structural diagrams. This paper uses these and other relations to 'reverse-engineer' the quenching process for central galaxies. The basic idea is that star-forming galaxies with larger radii (at a given stellar mass) have lower black-hole masses due to lower central densities. Galaxies cross into the green valley when the cumulative effective energy radiated by their black hole equals equation their halo-gas binding energy. Since larger-radii galaxies have smaller black holes, one finds they must evolve to higher stellar masses in order to meet this halo-energy criterion, which explains the sloping boundaries. A possible cause of radii differences among star-forming galaxies is halo concentration. The evolutionary tracks of star-forming galaxies are nearly parallel to the green-valley boundaries, and it is mainly the sideways motions of these boundaries with cosmic time that cause galaxies to quench. BH-scaling laws for star-forming, quenched, and green-valley galaxies are different, and most BH mass growth takes place in the green valley. Implications include: the radii of star-forming galaxies are an important second parameter in shaping their black holes; black holes are connected to their halos but in different ways for star-forming, quenched, and green-valley galaxies; and the same BH-halo quenching mechanism has been in place since equation. We conclude with a discussion of black hole-galaxy co-evolution, the origin and interpretation of BH scaling laws.",2019,[],5
1911.09685,astro-ph,"We characterize equation W UMa type (EW) contact binaries, including equation new discoveries, using ASAS-SN equation-band all-sky light curves along with archival data from Gaia, 2MASS, AllWISE, LAMOST, GALAH, RAVE, and APOGEE. There is a clean break in the EW period-luminosity relation at equation, separating the longer period early-type (A sub-type) EW binaries from the shorter period, late-type (W sub-type) systems. The two populations are even more cleanly separated in the space of period and effective temperature, by equation. Early-type and late-type EW binaries follow opposite trends in equation with orbital period. For longer periods, early-type EW binaries are cooler, while late-type systems are hotter. We derive period-luminosity relationships (PLRs) in the equation, equation, Gaia DR2 equation, equation, equation, equation and equation bands for the late-type and early-type EW binaries separated both by period and effective temperature, and by period alone. The dichotomy of contact binaries is almost certainly related to the Kraft break and the related changes in envelope structure, winds and angular momentum loss.",2019,[],5
1911.07911,astro-ph,"We constrain the evolution of the brightest cluster galaxy plus intracluster light (BCGICL) using an ensemble of 42 galaxy groups and clusters that span redshifts of z = 0.05-1.75 and masses of equation Mequation Specifically, we measure the relationship between the BCGICL stellar mass equation and equation at projected radii 10 < r < 100 kpc for three different epochs. At intermediate redshift (z = 0.40), where we have the best data, we find equation. Fixing the exponent of this power law for all redshifts, we constrain the normalization of this relation to be equation times higher at z = 0.40 than at high redshift (z = 1.55). We find no change in the relation from intermediate to low redshift (z = 0.10). In other words, for fixed equation, equation at 10 < r < 100 kpc increases from z = 1.55 to z = 0.40 and not significantly thereafter. Theoretical models predict that the physical mass growth of the cluster from z = 1.5 to z = 0 within equation is a factor of 1.4, excluding evolution due to definition of equation. We find that equation within the central 100 kpc increases by a factor of 3.8 over the same period. Thus, the growth of equation in this central region is more than a factor of two greater than the physical mass growth of the cluster as a whole. Furthermore, the concentration of the BCGICL stellar mass, defined by the ratio of stellar mass within 10 kpc to the total stellar mass within 100 kpc, decreases with increasing equation at all redshift. We interpret this result as evidence for inside-out growth of the BCGICL over the past ten Gyrs, with stellar mass assembly occuring at larger radii at later times.",2019,[],5
1902.00292,astro-ph,"We study processes occurring after a sudden heating of the chromosphere at the flare arcade footpoints which is assumed to be caused by particle beams. For the numerical simulations we adopt a 2-D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, in which we solve a full set of the time-dependent MHD equations by means of the FLASH code, using the Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) method. In the initial state we consider a model of the solar atmosphere with densities according to the VAL-C model and the magnetic field arcade having the X-point structure above, where the magnetic reconnection is assumed. We found that the sudden pulse-beam heating of the chromosphere at the flare arcade footpoints generates magnetohydrodynamic shocks, one propagating upwards and the second one propagating downwards in the solar atmosphere. The downward moving shock is reflected at deep and dense atmospheric layers and triggers oscillations of these layers. These oscillations generate the upwards moving magnetohydrodynamic waves that can influence the above located magnetic reconnection in a quasi-periodic way. Because these processes require a sudden heating in very localized regions in the chromosphere therefore they can be also associated with seismic waves.",2019,[],5
1903.11910,astro-ph,"The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) is a next-generation observatory for high energy gamma rays and cosmic rays with wide field of view. It will detect gamma rays with high sensitivity in the energy range from 300 GeV to 1 PeV. Therefore, it is promising for LHAASO to search for the high-energy gamma rays induced by dark matter (DM) self-annihilation in dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies (dSphs), which are ideal objects for the DM indirect detection. In this work, we investigate the LHAASO sensitivity to DM self-annihilation signatures for 19 dSphs and take the uncertainties on the spatial DM distribution of dSphs into account. We perform a joint likelihood analysis for the 19 dSphs and find that the LHAASO sensitivity to the DM annihilation cross section will reach equation cmequation sequation at the mass scale above TeV for several annihilation modes, which is larger than the canonical thermal relic cross section by a factor of 10 to 100.",2019,[],5
1908.08703,astro-ph,"A small subset of young stellar objects (YSOs) exhibit ""see-saw"" temporal variations in their mid-infrared SED; as the flux short-ward of a fulcrum wavelength (equation) increases the flux long-wards of this wavelength decreases (and vice-versa) over timescales of weeks to years. While previous studies have shown that an opaque, axisymmetric occulter of variable height can cause this behaviour in the SED of these objects, the conditions under which a single equation occurs have not previously been determined, nor the factors determining its value. Using radiative transfer modelling, we conduct a parametric study of the exemplar of this class, LRLL 31 to explore this phenomenon, and confirm that the cause of this flux variation is likely due to the change in height of the optically thick inner rim of the accretion disc at the dust sublimation radius, or some other phenomenon which results in a similar appearance. We also determine that a fulcrum wavelength only occurs for high inclinations, where the line of sight intersects the accretion disc. Accepting that the disc of LRLL 31 is highly inclined, the inner rim radius, radial and vertical density profiles are independently varied to gauge what effect this had on equation and its position relative to the silicate feature near equationm. While equation is a function of each of these parameters, it is found to be most strongly dependent on the vertical density exponent equation. All other factors being held constant, only for flatter discs (equation) did we find a equation beyond the silicate feature.",2019,[],5

1907.07656,astro-ph,"We report the discovery of the fifth self-lensing binary in which a low-mass white dwarf (WD) gravitationally magnifies its 15th magnitude G-star companion, KIC 8145411, during eclipses. The system was identified from a pair of such self-lensing events in the Kepler photometry, and was followed up with the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES) on the 1.5m telescope at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory and the High-Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) on the Subaru 8.2m telescope. A joint analysis of the TRES radial velocities, the HDS spectrum, and the Kepler photometry of the primary star determines the WD mass equation, orbital semi-major axis equation, and orbital eccentricity equation. Because such extremely low-mass WDs cannot be formed in isolation within the age of the Galaxy, their formation is believed to involve binary interactions that truncated evolution of the WD progenitor. However, the observed orbit of the KIC 8145411 system is at least ten times wider than required for this scenario to work. The presence of this system in the Kepler sample, along with its similarities to field blue straggler binaries presumably containing WDs, may suggest that some 10% of post-AGB binaries with Sun-like primaries contain such anomalous WDs.",2019,[],5
1907.10675,astro-ph,"Context. One of the keys to understanding the origin of the Ap stars and their significance in the general context of stellar astrophysics is the consideration of the most extreme properties displayed by some of them. In that context, HD 965 is particularly interesting, as it combines some of the most pronounced chemical peculiarities with one of the longest rotation periods known.   Aims. We characterise the variations of the magnetic field of the Ap star HD 965 and derive constraints about its structure.   Methods. We combine published measurements of the mean longitudinal field <Bz> of HD 965 with new determinations of this field moment from circular spectropolarimetry obtained at the 6-m telescope BTA of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. For the mean magnetic field modulus <B>, literature data are complemented by the analysis of ESO archive spectra.   Results. We present the first determination of the rotation period of HD 965, P = (16.5/-0.5) y. HD 965 is only the third Ap star with a period longer than 10 years for which magnetic field measurements have been obtained over more than a full cycle. The variation curve of <Bz> is well approximated by a cosine wave. <B> does not show any significant variation. The observed behaviour of these field moments is well represented by a simple model consisting of the superposition of collinear dipole, quadrupole and octupole. The distribution of neodymium over the surface of HD 965 is highly non-uniform. The element appears concentrated around the magnetic poles, especially the negative one.   Conclusions. The shape of the longitudinal magnetic variation curve of HD 965 indicates that its magnetic field is essentially symmetric about an axis passing through the centre of the star. Overall, as far as its magnetic field is concerned, HD 965 appears similar to the bulk of the long-period Ap stars.",2019,[],5

In the classification of variability classes of GRS 1915105, at the start of the observation period the source was in class omega and at the end the variability was that of class mu: both classes are characterized by the absence of hard intervals and correspond to disk-dominated spectra. After normalization to take into account time variations of the spectral properties as measured by X-ray hardness, the QPO centroid frequency is observed to vary along the hardness-intensity diagram, increasing with hardness. We also measure phase lags that indicate that HFQPO variability at high energies lags that at lower energies and detect systematic variations with the position on the hardness-intensity diagram. This is the first time that (small) variations of the HFQPO frequency and lags are observed to correlate with other properties of the source. We discuss the results in the framework of existing models, although the small (7%) variability observed is too small to draw firm conclusions.",2019,[],5
1910.02355,astro-ph,"A large number of studies have responded to the growing body of confirmed terrestrial habitable zone exoplanets by presenting models of various possible climates. However, the impact of the partial pressure of background gases such as Nequation has been poorly-explored, despite the abundance of Nequation in Earth's atmosphere and the lack of constraints on its typical abundance in terrestrial planet atmospheres. We use PlaSim, a fast 3D climate model, to simulate many hundreds of climates with varying Nequation partial pressures, insolations, and surface characteristics to identify the impact of the background gas partial pressure on the climate. We find that the climate's response is nonlinear and highly sensitive to the background gas partial pressure. We identify pressure broadening of COequation and HequationO absorption lines, amplification of warming or cooling by the water vapor greenhouse positive feedback, heat transport efficiency, and cooling through Rayleigh scattering as the dominant competing mechanisms that determine the equilibrium climate for a given Nequation partial pressure. Finally, we show that different amounts of Nequation should have a significant effect on broadband reflected light observations of terrestrial exoplanets.",2019,[],5
1906.00060,astro-ph,"This paper is the third of a series in which we investigate the discrimination between Gaussian (G) and Non-Gaussian (NG) clusters, based on the velocity distribution of the member galaxies. We study a sample of 177 groups from the Yang catalog in the redshift interval of 0.03 equation z equation 0.1 and masses equation 10equation. Examining the projected stellar mass density distributions of G and NG groups we find strong evidence of a higher infall rate in the outskirts of NG groups over the G ones. There is a 61\% excess of faint galaxies in NGs when contrasted with G groups, when integrating equation. The study of the Star Formation History (SFH) of ellipticals and spirals in the three main regions of the Projected Phase Space (PPS) reveals also that the star formation in faint spirals of NG groups is significantly different from their counterpart in the G groups. The assembled mass for Faint spirals varies from 59\% at 12.7 Gyr to 75\% at 8.0 Gyr, while in G systems this variation is from 82\% to 91\%. This finding may also be interpreted as a higher infall rate of gas rich systems in NG groups. This accretion process through the filaments, disturbing the velocity distribution and modifying not only the stellar population of the incoming galaxies but also their SFH, should be seriously considered in modelling galaxy evolution.",2019,[],5
1905.12641,astro-ph,"The observed characteristics of globular cluster (GC) systems, such as metallicity distributions, are commonly used to place constraints on galaxy formation models. However, obtaining reliable metallicity values is particularly difficult because of our limited means to obtain high quality spectroscopy of extragalactic GCs. Often, `color--metallicity relations' are invoked to convert easier-to-obtain photometric measurements into metallicities, but there is no consensus on what form these relations should take. In this paper we make use of multiple photometric datasets and iron metallicity values derived from applying full-spectrum stellar population synthesis models to deep Keck/LRIS spectra of 177 GCs centrally located around M87 to obtain a new color--metallicity relation. Our new relation differs substantially from previous relations in the blue, and we present evidence that the M87 relation differs from that of the Milky Way GCs, suggesting environmental dependence of GC properties. We use our color--metallicity relation to derive a new GC metallicity-host galaxy luminosity relation for red and blue GCs and find a shallower relation for the blue GCs than what previous work has found and that the metal-poor GCs are more enriched than what was previously found. This could indicate that the progenitor satellite galaxies that now make up the stellar halos of early-type galaxies are more massive and formed later than previously thought, or that the properties of metal-poor GCs are less dependent on their present-day host, indicating a common origin.",2019,[],5
1902.10488,astro-ph,"The large dark cores of common dwarf galaxies are unexplained by the standard heavy particle interpretation of dark matter.   This puzzle is exacerbated by the discovery of a very large but barely visible, dark matter dominated galaxy Antlia II orbiting the Milky Way, uncovered by tracking star motions with the \t Gaia satellite. Although Antlia II has a low mass, its visible radius is more than double any known dwarf galaxy, with an unprecedentedly low density core. We show that Antlia II favors dark matter as a Bose-Einstein condensate, for which the ground state is a stable soliton with a core radius given by the de Broglie wavelength. The lower the galaxy mass, the larger the de Broglie wavelength, so the least massive galaxies should have the widest soliton cores of lowest density. An ultra-light boson of equation eV, accounts well for the large size and slowly moving stars within Antlia II, and agrees with boson mass estimates derived from the denser cores of more massive dwarf galaxies. For this very light boson, Antlia II is close to the lower limiting Jeans scale for galaxy formation permitted by the Uncertainty Principle, so other examples are expected but none significantly larger in size. This simple explanation for the puzzling dark cores of dwarf galaxies implies dark matter as an ultra-light boson, such as an axion generic in String Theory.",2019,[],5

Our analytic solutions allow to easily disentangle the diverse role of the main physical processes regulating galaxy formation, to quickly explore the related parameter space, and to make transparent predictions on spatially-averaged quantities.

1901.09488,astro-ph,"We use the full-sky ray-tracing weak lensing simulations to generate 2268 mock catalogues for the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey first-year shear catalogue. Our mock catalogues take into account various effects as in the real data: the survey footprints, inhomogeneous angular distribution of source galaxies, statistical uncertainties in photometric redshift (photo-equation) estimate, variations in the lensing weight, and the statistical noise in galaxy shape measurements including both intrinsic shapes and the measurement errors. We then utilize our mock catalogues to evaluate statistical uncertainties expected in measurements of cosmic shear two-point correlations equation with tomographic redshift information for the HSC survey. We develop a quasi-analytical formula for the Gaussian sample variance properly taking into account the number of source pairs in the survey footprints. The standard Gaussian formula significantly overestimates or underestimates the mock results by equation level. We also show that different photo-equation catalogues or the six disconnected fields, rather than a consecutive geometry, cause variations in the covariance by equation. The mock catalogues enable us to study the chi-square distribution for equation. We find the wider distribution than that naively expected for the distribution with the degrees-of-freedom of data vector used. Finally, we propose a method to include non-zero multiplicative bias in mock shape catalogue and show the non-zero multiplicative bias can change the effective shape noise in cosmic shear analyses. Our results suggest an importance of estimating an accurate form of the likelihood function (and therefore the covariance) for robust cosmological parameter inference from the precise measurements.",2019,[],5
1902.05956,astro-ph,"In the standard picture for low-mass star formation, a dense molecular cloud undergoes gravitational collapse to form a protostellar system consisting of a new central star, a circumstellar disk, and a surrounding envelope of remaining material. The mass distribution of the system evolves as matter accretes from the large-scale envelope through the disk and onto the protostar. While this general picture is supported by simulations and indirect observational measurements, the specific timescales related to disk growth and envelope dissipation remain poorly constrained. In this paper we conduct a rigorous test of a method introduced by J\orgensen et al. (2009) to obtain mass measurements of disks and envelopes around embedded protostars with observations that do not resolve the disk (resolution of equation1000\,AU). Using unresolved data from the recent Mass Assembly of Stellar Systems and their Evolution with the SMA (MASSES) survey, we derive disk and envelope mass estimates for equation protostellar systems in the Perseus molecular cloud. We compare our results to independent disk mass measurements from the VLA Nascent Disk and Multiplicity (VANDAM) survey and find a strong linear correlation, suggesting that accurate disk masses can be measured from unresolved observations. Then, leveraging the size of the MASSES sample, we find no significant trend in protostellar mass distribution as a function of age, as approximated from bolometric temperatures. These results may indicate that the disk mass of a protostar is set near the onset of the Class 0 protostellar stage and remains roughly constant throughout the Class I protostellar stage.",2019,[],5

We present the results of a new large Lithium survey in red giant stars and combine it with surveys from the literature to probe the impact of rotation-induced mixing and thermohaline double-diffusive instability along stellar evolution. We determined the surface Li abundance for a sample of 829 giant stars with accurate Gaia parallaxes for a large sub-sample (810 stars) complemented with accurate Hipparcos parallaxes (19 stars). The spectra of our sample of northern and southern giant stars were obtained in three ground-based observatories (OHP, ESO-La Silla, Mc Donald). We determined the atmospheric parameters (Teff, log(g), [Fe/H]), and the Li abundance. We used Gaia parallaxes and photometry to determine the luminosity of our objects and we estimated the mass and evolution status of each sample star with a maximum-likelihood technique using stellar evolution models computed with the STAREVOL code. We compared the observed Li behaviour with predictions from stellar models, including rotation and thermohaline mixing. The same approach was used for stars from selected Li surveys from the literature. Rotation-induced mixing accounts nicely for the lithium behaviour in stars warmer than about 4200K, independently of the mass domain. For stars with masses lower than 2Msun thermohaline mixing leads to further Li depletion below the Teff of the RGB bump (about 4000K), and on the early AGB, as observed. Depending on the definition we adopt, we find between 0.8 and 2.2% of Li-rich giants in our new sample. Gaia puts a new spin on the understanding of mixing processes in stars, and our study confirms the importance of rotation-induced processes and of thermohaline mixing. However asteroseismology is required to definitively pinpoint the actual evolution status of Li-rich giants.",2019,[],5

The slope and intercept of the relation are consistent with those published in the literature. Then, we investigate the optical properties of the cluster galaxies including their morphological analysis and the galaxy luminosity functions. The morphological content of cluster galaxies is investigated as a function of cluster mass and distance from the cluster center. No strong variation of the fraction of early and late type galaxies with cluster mass is observed. The fraction of early type galaxies as a function of cluster radius varies as expected. The individual galaxy luminosity functions (GLFs) of red sequence galaxies were studied in the five ugriz bands for 48 clusters. The GLFs were then stacked in three mass bins and two redshift bins.

We apply this method to galaxies brighter than equation AB mag at the redshift range of equation in the five CANDELS fields (GOODS-N, GOODS-S, EGS, UDS, and COSMOS). We then use these measurements to explore the environmental dependence of the star formation activity of galaxies. We find strong evidence of environmental quenching for massive galaxies (equation) out to equation such that an over-dense environment hosts equation more massive quiescent galaxies compared to an under-dense region. We also find that environmental quenching efficiency grows with stellar mass and reaches equation for massive galaxies at equation. The environmental quenching is also more efficient in comparison to the stellar mass quenching for low mass galaxies (equation) at low and intermediate redshifts (equation). Our findings concur thoroughly with the ""over-consumption"" quenching model where the termination of cool gas accretion (cosmological starvation) happens in an over-dense environment and the galaxy starts to consume its remaining gas reservoir in depletion time. The depletion time depends on the stellar mass and could explain the evolution of environmental quenching efficiency with the stellar mass.",2019,[],5
1909.00144,astro-ph,"Hydrodynamical simulations predict that the jets of young radio sources can inhibit star formation in their host galaxies by injecting heat and turbulence into the interstellar medium (ISM). To investigate jet-ISM interactions in a galaxy with a young radio source, we have carried out a multi-wavelength study of the equation Compact Steep Spectrum radio source hosted by the early-type galaxy UGC 05771. Using Keck/OSIRIS observations, we detected H\textsubscript2 1--0 S(1) and [Fe \textscii] emission at radii of 100s of pc, which traces shocked molecular and ionised gas being accelerated outwards by the jets to low velocities, creating a `stalling wind'. At kpc radii, we detected shocked ionised gas using observations from the CALIFA survey, covering an area much larger than the pc-scale radio source. We found that existing interferometric radio observations fail to recover a large fraction of the source's total flux, indicating the likely existence of jet plasma on kpc scales, which is consistent with the extent of shocked gas in the host galaxy. To investigate the star formation efficiency in UGC 05771, we obtained IRAM CO observations to analyse the molecular gas properties. We found that UGC 05771 sits below the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, although we were unable to definitively conclude if direct interactions from the jets are inhibiting star formation.

In this case, acceleration is induced by the interstellar (IS) shock waves. These IS shocks are mainly associated with emission nebulae (HII regions, planetary nebulae and supernova remnants). Among all types of emission nebulae, the strongest shocks are associated with supernova remnants (SNRs).

1902.01921,astro-ph,"In a previous work, Hoang and Tram discovered a new mechanism for destruction of nanoparticles due to suprathermal rotation of grains in stationary C-shocks, which is termed rotational disruption. In this paper, we extend our previous study for non-stationary shocks driven by outflows and young supernovae remnants that have dynamical ages shorter than the time required to establish a stationary C-shock, which is composed of a C-shock and a J-shock tail (referred as CJ-shock). For the C-shock component, we find that smallest nanoparticles (size equation nm) of weak materials (i.e., tensile strength equation) can be rotationally disrupted due to suprathermal rotation induced by supersonic neutral drift. For the J-shock component, although nanoparticles are rotating thermally, the smallest ones can still be disrupted because the gas is heated to higher temperatures by J-shocks. We then model microwave emission from rapidly spinning nanoparticles where the grain size distribution has the lower cutoff determined by rotational disruption for the different shock models. We also calculate the spectral flux of microwave emission from a shocked region at distance of 100 pc from the observer for the different gas density, shock age, and shock velocities. We suggest that microwave emission from spinning dust can be used to trace nanoparticles and shock velocities in dense molecular outflows. Finally, we discuss a new way that can release molecules from the nanoparticle surface into the gas in the shocked regions, which we name rotational desorption.",2019,[],5

We show that the high-frequency radio sizes of SMGs are equation (equation-equationkpc) larger than those of the cool dust emission, and find evidence for a subset of our sources being extended on equationkpc scales at 1.4GHz. By combining radio flux densities measured at three frequencies, we can move beyond simple linear fits to the radio spectra of high-redshift star-forming galaxies, and search for spectral curvature, which has been observed in local starburst galaxies. At least a quarter (10/41) of our sample show evidence of a spectral break, with a median equation, but equation -- a high-frequency flux deficit relative to simple extrapolations from the low-frequency data. We explore this result within this subset of sources in the context of age-related synchrotron losses, showing that a combination of weak magnetic fields (equationG) and young ages (equation--equationMyr) for the central starburst can reproduce the observed spectral break. Assuming these represent evolved (but ongoing) starbursts and we are observing these systems roughly half-way through their current episode of star formation, this implies starburst durations of equationMyr, in reasonable agreement with estimates derived via gas depletion timescales.",2019,[],5
1910.01825,astro-ph,"The Micro Solar-Flare Apparatus (MiSolFA) is a compact X-ray imaging spectrometer designed for a small 6U micro-satellite. As a relatively inexpensive yet capable Earth-orbiting instrument, MiSolFA is designed to image the high-energy regions of solar flares from a different perspective than that of Solar Orbiter's STIX, operating from a highly elliptical heliocentric orbit. Two instruments working together in this way would provide a 3-dimensional view of X-ray emitting regions and can bypass the dynamic range limitation preventing simultaneous coronal and chromospheric imaging. Stereoscopic X-ray observations would also contain valuable information about the anisotropy of the flare-accelerated electron distribution. To perform these types of observations, MiSolFA must be capable of imaging sources with energies between 10 and 100 keV, with 10 arcsec angular resolution. MiSolFA's Imager will be the most compact X-ray imaging spectrometer in space. Scaling down the volume by a factor of ten from previous instrument designs requires special considerations.

1905.08631,astro-ph,"As of today ten circumbinary planets orbiting solar type main sequence stars have been discovered. Nearly all of them orbit around the central binary very closely to the region of instability where it is difficult to form them in situ. It is assumed that they formed further out and migrated to their observed position. We extend previous studies to a more realistic thermal disc structure and determine what parameter influence the final parking location of a planet around a binary star. We perform two-dimensional numerical simulations of viscous accretion discs around a central binary that include viscous heating and radiative cooling from the disc surfaces. We vary the binary eccentricity as well as disc viscosity and mass. Concerning the disc evolution we find that it can take well over 100000 binary orbits until an equilibrium state is reached. As seen previously, we find that the central cavity opened by the binary becomes eccentric and precesses slowly in a prograde sense. Embedded planets migrate to the inner edge of the disc. In cases of lower disc viscosity they migrate further in maintaining a circular orbit, while for high viscosity they are parked further out on an eccentric orbit. The final location of an embedded planet is linked to its ability to open a gap in the disc. Gap opening planets separate inner from outer disc, preventing eccentricity excitation in the latter and making it more circular. This allows embedded planets to migrate closer to the binary, in agreement with the observations. The necessary condition for gap opening and the final planet position depend on the planet mass and disc viscosity.",2019,[],5
1910.01980,astro-ph,"We present Herschel Space Observatory Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) and Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver Fourier Transform Spectrometer (SPIRE FTS) spectroscopy of a sample of twenty massive Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC). We analyse the brightest far infrared (far-IR) emission lines, that diagnose the conditions of the heated gas in the YSO envelope and pinpoint their physical origin.We compare the properties of massive Magellanic and Galactic YSOs.We find that [OI] and [CII] emission, that originates from the photodissociation region associated with the YSOs, is enhanced with respect to the dust continuum in the Magellanic sample. Furthermore the photoelectric heating efficiency is systematically higher for Magellanic YSOs, consistent with reduced grain charge in low metallicity environments. The observed CO emission is likely due to multiple shock components. The gas temperatures, derived from the analysis of CO rotational diagrams, are similar to Galactic estimates. This suggests a common origin to the observed CO excitation, from low-luminosity to massive YSOs, both in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. Bright far-IR line emission provides a mechanism to cool the YSO environment. We find that, even though [OI], CO and [CII] are the main line coolants, there is an indication that CO becomes less important at low metallicity, especially for the SMC sources. This is consistent with a reduction in CO abundance in environments where the dust is warmer due to reduced ultraviolet-shielding. Weak HequationO and OH emission is detected, consistent with a modest role in the energy balance of wider massive YSO environments.",2019,[],5
1903.07487,astro-ph,We study the contribution to the primordial curvature perturbation on observational scales generated by the reheating field in massless preheating. To do so we use lattice simulations and a recent extension to the equation formalism.

1902.10410,astro-ph,"Context. Magnetic helicity is an important quantity in studies of magnetized plasmas as it provides a measure of the geometrical complexity of the magnetic field in a given volume. A more detailed description of the spatial distribution of magnetic helicity is given by the field line helicity that expresses the amount of helicity associated to individual field lines, rather than in the full analysed volume. Aims. Magnetic helicity is not a gauge-invariant quantity in general, unless it is computed with respect to a reference field, yielding the so called relative magnetic helicity. The field line helicity corresponding to the relative magnetic helicity has only been examined under specific conditions so far. This work aims to define the field line helicity corresponding to relative magnetic helicity in the most general way. In addition to its general form, we provide the expression for the relative magnetic field line helicity in a few commonly used gauges, and reproduce known results as a limit of our general formulation. Methods. By starting from the definition of relative magnetic helicity, we derive the corresponding field line helicity, and we note the assumptions it is based on. Results. We check that the developed quantity reproduces relative magnetic helicity by using three different numerical simulations. For these cases we also show the morphology of field line helicity in the volume, and on the photospheric plane. As an application to solar situations, we compare the morphology of field line helicity on the photosphere with that of the connectivity-based helicity flux density in two reconstructions of an active region's magnetic field. We discuss how the derived relative magnetic field line helicity has a wide range of applications, notably in solar physics and magnetic reconnection studies.",2019,[],5
1909.01841,astro-ph,"In the binary-driven hypernova model of long gamma-ray bursts, a carbon-oxygen star explodes as a supernova in presence of a neutron star binary companion in close orbit. Hypercritical (i.e. highly super-Eddington) accretion of the ejecta matter onto the neutron star sets in, making it reach the critical mass with consequent formation of a Kerr black hole. We have recently shown that, during the accretion process onto the neutron star, fast neutrino flavour oscillations occur. Numerical simulations of the above system show that a part of the ejecta keeps bound to the newborn Kerr black hole, leading to a new process of hypercritical accretion. We here address, also for this phase of the binary-driven hypernova, the occurrence of neutrino flavour oscillations given the extreme conditions of high density (up to equation g cmequation) and temperatures (up to tens of MeV) inside this disk. We estimate the \textcolorredbehaviour of the electronic and non-electronic neutrino content within the two-flavour formalism (equation) under the action of neutrino collective effects by neutrino self-interactions. We find that in the case of inverted mass hierarchy, neutrino oscillations inside the disk have frequencies between equation-equation sequation, leading the disk to achieve flavour equipartition. This implies that the energy deposition rate by neutrino annihilation (equation) in the vicinity of the Kerr black hole, is smaller than previous estimates in the literature not accounting by flavour oscillations inside the disk. The exact value of the reduction factor depends on the equation and equation optical depths but it can be as high as equation. The results of this work are a first step toward the analysis of neutrino oscillations in a novel astrophysical context and, as such, deserve further attention.",2019,[],5

1905.06954,astro-ph,"Mapping the intergalactic medium (IGM) in Lyman-equation emission would yield unprecedented tomographic information on the large-scale distribution of baryons and potentially provide new constraints on the UV background and various feedback processes relevant for galaxy formation. Here, we examine the Lyman-equation emission of the moderate-density IGM due to collisional excitations and recombinations in the presence of a UV background in the Sherwood simulation suite. We focus on large-scale-structure filaments in which Lyman-equation radiative transfer effects are expected to be moderate. At low density the emission is primarily due to fluorescent re-emission of the ionising UV background due to recombinations, while collisional excitations dominate at higher densities. We discuss prospects of current and future observational facilities to detect this emission and focus on VLT/MUSE for a more detailed sensitivity analysis. We construct mock MUSE observations resembling the MUSE Hubble Deep Field South from our simulations and show that our predictions are consistent with recent analyses of diffuse Lyman-equation emission using MUSE at redshifts equation. We find that it should be most feasible to detect the Lyman-equation emission from filaments in the IGM in overdense regions, somewhat surprisingly towards the high-redshift end (equation) accessible by MUSE, and if narrowband widths close to the MUSE spectral resolution limit are used. This is due to the higher densities and lower temperatures in the IGM at higher redshift. High-redshift protoclusters therefore appear to be the ideal environment to observe filamentary structures in the IGM in Lyman-equation emission.",2019,[],5
1909.12860,astro-ph,"The precise measurement of the spectrum of protons, the most abundant component of the cosmic radiation, is necessary to understand the source and acceleration of cosmic rays in the Milky Way. This work reports the measurement of the cosmic ray proton fluxes with kinetic energies from 40 GeV to 100 TeV, with two and a half years of data recorded by the DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE). This is the first time an experiment directly measures the cosmic ray protons up to ~100 TeV with a high statistics. The measured spectrum confirms the spectral hardening found by previous experiments and reveals a softening at ~13.6 TeV, with the spectral index changing from ~2.60 to ~2.85. Our result suggests the existence of a new spectral feature of cosmic rays at energies lower than the so-called knee, and sheds new light on the origin of Galactic cosmic rays.",2019,[],5
1911.04763,astro-ph,"Globular clusters contain multiple stellar populations with peculiar chemical compositions. Pollution of the intracluster gas by an early population of fast-evolving stars is the most common scenario for explaining the observations. Stars with masses in excess of 1000 Msun have recently been suggested as potential polluters. We investigate the spectral properties of proto-GCs that would host a supermassive star. Our main goal is to quantify how such a star would affect the integrated light of the cluster, and to study the detectability of such objects. We computed non-LTE atmosphere models for SMS with various combinations of stellar parameters (luminosity, effective temperature, and mass) and metallicities appropriate for GCs, and we predict their emergent spectra. Using these spectra, we calculated the total emission of young proto-GCs with SMS as predicted in a previously reported scenario, and we computed synthetic photometry in UV, optical, and near-IR bands, in particular for the JWST. At an effective temperature of 10000 K, the spectrum of SMSs shows a Balmer break in emission. This feature is due to strong non-LTE effects (implied by the high luminosity) and is not observed in normal stars. The hydrogen lines also show a peculiar behavior, with Balmer lines in emission while higher series lines are in absorption. At 7000 K, the Balmer break shows a strong absorption. At high effective temperatures, the Lyman break is found in emission. Cool and luminous SMSs are found to dominate the integrated spectrum of the cluster, except for the UV range. The predicted magnitudes of these proto-GCs are mAB~28-30 between 0.7 and 8 um and for redshifts z~4-10, which is detectable with the JWST. The peculiar observational features of cool SMSs imply that they might in principle be detected in color-color diagrams that probe the spectral energy distribution below and above the Balmer break.",2019,[],5
1904.05676,astro-ph,"The importance of studying the Gaia DR2 parallax zero-point by external means was underlined by Lindegren et al. (2018), and initiated by several works making use of Cepheids, eclipsing binaries, and asteroseismology. Despite a very efficient elimination of basic-angle variations, a small fluctuation remains and shows up as a small offset in the Gaia DR2 parallaxes. By combining astrometric, asteroseismic, spectroscopic, and photometric constraints, we undertake a new analysis of the Gaia parallax offset for nearly 3000 red-giant branch (RGB) and 2200 red clump (RC) stars observed by Kepler, as well as about 500 and 700 red giants (both RGB and RC) selected by the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program in campaigns 3 and 6. Engaging into a thorough comparison of the astrometric and asteroseismic parallaxes, we are able to highlight the influence of the asteroseismic method, and measure parallax offsets in the Kepler field that are compatible with independent estimates from literature and open clusters. Moreover, adding the K2 fields to our investigation allows us to retrieve a clear illustration of the positional dependence of the zero-point, in general agreement with the information provided by quasars. Lastly, we initiate a two-step methodology to make progress in the simultaneous calibration of the asteroseismic scaling relations and of the Gaia DR2 parallax offset, which will greatly benefit from the gain in precision with the third Data Release of Gaia.",2019,[],5
1912.12218,astro-ph,"With the detection of gravitational wave (GW) GW170817 and its associated electromagnetic (EM) counterparts from a binary neutron star (NS) merger, the ""standard siren"" method for Hubble-constant measurements is expected to play a role in the Hubble-constant tension in the next few years. One intriguing proposal put forward in multiple studies is to use an NS merger's optical counterpart, known as a kilonova, as a standard candle, because its absolute magnitude can in principle be calculated from simulations. In this work, I detail the statistical framework for performing joint standard-candle and standard-siren measurements using GWs, EM follow-up data, and simulations of EM counterparts. I then perform an example analysis using GW170817 and its optical counterpart AT2017gfo to illustrate the method and the method's limitations. Crucially, the inferences using this method are only as robust as the EM counterpart models, so significant theoretical advances are needed before this method can be employed for precision cosmology.",2019,[],5
1908.02717,astro-ph,"Empirical stellar spectral libraries have applications in both extragalactic and stellar studies, and they have an advantage over theoretical libraries because they naturally include all relevant chemical species and physical processes. During recent years we see a stream of new high quality sets of spectra, but increasing the spectral resolution and widening the wavelength coverage means resorting to multi-order echelle spectrographs. Assembling the spectra from many pieces results in lower fidelity of their shapes. We aim to offer the community a library of high signal-to-noise spectra with reliable continuum shapes. Furthermore, the using an integral field unit (IFU) alleviates the issue of slit losses. Our library was build with the MUSE (Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) IFU instrument. We obtained spectra over nearly the entire visual band (lambda~4800-9300 Ang). We assembled a library of 35 high-quality MUSE spectra for a subset of the stars from the X-shooter Spectral Library. We verified the continuum shape of these spectra with synthetic broad band colors derived from the spectra. We also report some spectral indices from the Lick system, derived from the new observations. We offer a high-fidelity set of stellar spectra that covers the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. It can be useful for both extragalactic and stellar work and demonstrates that the IFUs are excellent tools for building reliable spectral libraries.",2019,[],5
1902.05960,astro-ph,"Deep optical spectroscopic surveys of galaxies provide us a unique opportunity to investigate rest-frame ultra-violet (UV) emission line properties of galaxies at equation.

The deepest areas of our MUSE pointings reach a equation line flux limit of 3.1equation10-19 erg/ s/ cmequation. After discarding broad line active galactic nuclei we find 13 HeIIequation1640 detections from MUSE with a median MUV = equation and 21 tentative HeIIequation1640 detections from other public surveys. Excluding Lyequation, all except two galaxies in our sample show at least one other rest-UV emission line, with CIII]equation1907,equation1909 being the most prominent.

Taking advantage of the high quality spectra obtained by MUSE (equationh of exposure time per pointing), we use photo-ionisation models to study the rest-UV emission line diagnostics of the HeIIequation1640 emitters. Line ratios of our sample can be reproduced by moderately sub-solar photo-ionisation models, however, we find that including effects of binary stars lead to degeneracies in most free parameters. Even after considering extra ionising photons produced by extreme sub-solar metallicity binary stellar models, photo-ionisation models are unable to reproduce rest-frame HeIIequation1640 equivalent widths (equation 0.2 - 10 A), thus additional mechanisms are necessary in models to match the observed HeIIequation1640 properties.",2019,[],5
1911.06823,astro-ph,"In recent years many works have shown that unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) can help detect unusual objects and uncover trends in large astronomical datasets, but a few challenges remain. We show here, for example, that different methods, or even small variations of the same method, can produce significantly different outcomes. While intuitively somewhat surprising, this can naturally occur when applying unsupervised ML to highly dimensional data, where there can be many reasonable yet different answers to the same question. In such a case the outcome of any single unsupervised ML method should be considered a sample from a conceivably wide range of possibilities. We therefore suggest an approach that eschews finding an optimal outcome, instead facilitating the production and examination of many valid ones. This can be achieved by incorporating unsupervised ML into data visualisation portals. We present here such a portal that we are developing, applied to the sample of SDSS spectra of galaxies. The main feature of the portal is interactive 2D maps of the data. Different maps are constructed by applying dimensionality reduction to different subspaces of the data, so that each map contains different information that in turn gives a different perspective on the data. The interactive maps are intuitive to use, and we demonstrate how peculiar objects and trends can be detected by means of a few button clicks. We believe that including tools in this spirit in next generation astronomical surveys will be important for making unexpected discoveries, either by professional astronomers or by citizen scientists, and will generally enable the benefits of visual inspection even when dealing with very complex and extensive datasets.

1903.12346,astro-ph,"Since the discovery of equation quasars two decades ago, studies of their Lyequation-transparent proximity zones have largely focused on their utility as a probe of cosmic reionization. But even when in a highly ionized intergalactic medium, these zones provide a rich laboratory for determining the timescales that govern quasar activity and the concomitant growth of their supermassive black holes. In this work, we use a suite of 1D radiative transfer simulations of quasar proximity zones to explore their time-dependent behaviour for activity timescales from equation to equation years. The sizes of the simulated proximity zones, as quantified by the distance at which the smoothed Lyequation transmission drops below 10% (denoted equation), are in excellent agreement with observations, with the exception of a handful of particularly small zones that have been attributed to extremely short equation year lifetimes. We develop a physically motivated semi-analytic model of proximity zones which captures the bulk of their equilibrium and non-equilibrium behaviour, and use this model to investigate how quasar variability on equation year timescales is imprinted on the distribution of observed proximity zone sizes. We show that large variations in the ionizing luminosity of quasars on timescales of equation years are disfavored based on the good agreement between the observed distribution of equation and our model prediction based on ""lightbulb"" (i.e. steady constant emission) light curves.",2019,[],5
1901.04144,astro-ph,"The Alfv\'en speed and plasma beta in photospheric bright points observed by the Broadband Filter Imager (BFI) of the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on board the \textitHinode satellite, are estimated seismologically. The diagnostics is based on the theory of slow magnetoacoustic waves in a non-isothermally stratified photosphere with a uniform vertical magnetic field. We identify and track bright points in a G-band movie by using the 3D region growing method, and align them with blue continuum images to derive their brightness temperatures. From the Fourier power spectra of 118 continuum light curves made in the bright points, we find that light curves of 91 bright points have oscillations with properties which are significantly different from oscillation in quiet regions, with the periods ranging 2.2--16.2~min.

1904.00333,astro-ph,"Previous (sub)millimeter observations have found that the spectral indices of dust emission from some young stellar objects are lower than that of the black body emission in the Rayleigh-Jeans limit (i.e., 2.0). In particular, the recent Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations have spatially resolved that the innermost regions of the protoplanetary disks TW\,Hya and HD\,163296 present anomalously low (i.e., equation2.0) millimeter spectral indices. In some previous works, such anomalously low millimeter spectral indices were considered unphysical and were attributed to measurement errors. The present work clarifies that if the albedo is high and is increasing with frequency, it is possible to reproduce such anomalously low spectral indices when the emission source is optically thick. In addition, to yield lower than 2.0 spectral index at (sub)millimeter bands, the required dust maximum grain size \amax is on the order of 10-100 \micron, which is very well consistent with the previously derived \amax values based on multi-wavelength dust polarimetric observations. In light of this, measuring Stokes I spectral index may also serve as an auxiliary approach for assessing whether the observed dust polarization is mainly due to dust scattering or is due to the aligned dust grains.",2019,[],5
1906.11494,astro-ph,"We present a new, multi-dimensional implementation of the Advanced Spectral Leakage (ASL) scheme with the purpose of modelling neutrino-matter interactions in neutron star mergers. A major challenge is the neutrino absorption in the semi-transparent regime, which is responsible for driving winds from the merger remnant. The composition of such winds is crucial in the understanding of the electromagnetic emission in the recently observed macronova following GW170817. Compared to the original version, we introduce an optical-depth-dependent flux factor to model the average angle of neutrino propagation, and a modulation that accounts for flux anisotropies in non-spherical geometries. We scrutinise our approach by first comparing the new scheme against the original one for a spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova snapshot, both in 1D and in 3D, and additionally against a two-moment (M1) scheme as implemented in 1D into the code GR1D. The luminosities and mean energies agree to a few percents in most tests. Finally, for the case of a binary merger remnant snapshot we compare the new ASL scheme with the M1 scheme that is implemented in the Eulerian adaptive mesh refinement code FLASH. We find that the neutrino absorption distribution in the semi-transparent regime is overall well reproduced. Both approaches agree to within equation for the average energies and to better than equation in the total luminosities.",2019,[],5
1901.02901,astro-ph,"Carbon dioxide is one of the major contributors to the radiative forcing, increasing both the temperature and the humidity of Earth's atmosphere. If the stellar irradiance increases and water becomes abundant in the stratosphere of an Earth-like planet, it will be dissociated and the resultant hydrogen will escape from the atmosphere. This state is called the moist greenhouse threshold (MGT). Using a global climate model (GCM) of intermediate complexity, we explore how to identify this state for different CO2 concentrations and including the radiative effect of atmospheric ozone for the first time. We show that the moist greenhouse threshold correlates with the inflection point in the water vapor mixing ratio in the stratosphere and a peak in the climate sensitivity. For CO2 concentrations between 560 ppm and 200 ppm, the moist greenhouse threshold is reached at a surface temperature of 320 K. Despite the higher simplicity of our model, our results are consistent with similar simulations without ozone by complex GCMs, suggesting that they are robust indicators of the MGT.

1912.02268,astro-ph,"Observations of scattered light and thermal emission from hot Jupiter exoplanets have suggested the presence of inhomogeneous aerosols in their atmospheres. 3D general circulation models (GCMs) that attempt to model the effects of aerosols have been developed to understand the physical processes that underlie their dynamical structures. In this work, we investigate how different approaches to aerosol modeling in GCMs of hot Jupiters affect high-resolution thermal emission spectra throughout the duration of the planet's orbit. Using results from a GCM with temperature-dependent cloud formation, we calculate spectra of a representative hot Jupiter with different assumptions regarding the vertical extent and thickness of clouds. We then compare these spectra from models in which clouds are absent or simply post-processed (i.e., added subsequently to the completed clear model). We show that the temperature-dependent treatment of clouds in the GCM produces high-resolution emission spectra that are markedly different from the clear and post-processed cases---both in the continuum flux levels and line profiles---and that increasing the vertical extent and thickness of clouds leads to bigger changes in these features. We evaluate the net Doppler shifts of the spectra induced by global winds and the planet's rotation and show that they are strongly phase-dependent, especially for models with thicker and more extended clouds. This work further demonstrates the importance of radiative feedback in cloudy atmospheric models of hot Jupiters, as this can have a significant impact on interpreting spectroscopic observations of exoplanet atmospheres.",2019,[],5
1909.00759,astro-ph,"We develop a pebble-driven model to study the formation and evolution of planets around stars in the mass range of 0.08 and 1 solar mass. The growth and migration of a large number of individual protoplanetary embryos are simulated in a population synthesis manner. We test two hypotheses for the birth locations of embryos: at the water ice line or log-uniformly distributed over entire protoplanetary disks. Two types of disks with different turbulent viscous parameters alpha of 1e-3 and 1e-4 are investigated, to shed light on the role of outward migration of protoplanets. The forming planets are compared with the observed exoplanets in terms of masses, semimajor axes, metallicities, and water contents. We find that gas giant planets are likely to form when the characteristic disk sizes are larger, the disk accretion rates are higher, the disks are more metal-rich and/or their stellar hosts are more massive. Our model shows that 1) the characteristic mass of super-Earth is set by the pebble isolation mass. Super-Earth masses increase linearly with the mass of its stellar host, corresponding to one Earth mass around a late M-dwarf star and 20 Earth masses around a solar-mass star. 2) The low-mass planets up to 20 Earth masses can form around stars with a wide range of metallicities, while massive gas giant planets are preferred to grow around metal-rich stars. 3) Super-Earth planets that are mainly composed of silicates, with relatively low water fractions can form from protoplanetary embryos at the water ice line in weakly turbulent disks where outward migration is suppressed. However, if the embryos are formed over a wide range of radial distances, the super-Earths would end up having a distinctive, bimodal composition in water mass.

Using the Gaia-measured distance and broad-band photometry we find that the host star is an M3 dwarf. Combined with the TESS transits from three sectors, the corresponding stellar parameters yield planet radii ranging from 0.8REarth to 1.6REarth. All three planets have short orbital periods, ranging from 2.25 to 7.45 days with the outer pair just wide of a 2:1 period resonance. Diagnostic tests produced by the TESS Data Validation Report and the vetting package DAVE rule out common false positive sources. These analyses, along with dedicated follow-up and the multiplicity of the system, lend confidence that the observed signals are caused by planets transiting L 98-59 and are not associated with other sources in the field. The L 98-59 system is interesting for a number of reasons: the host star is bright (V = 11.7 mag, K = 7.1 mag) and the planets are prime targets for further follow-up observations including precision radial-velocity mass measurements and future transit spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope; the near resonant configuration makes the system a laboratory to study planetary system dynamical evolution; and three planets of relatively similar size in the same system present an opportunity to study terrestrial planets where other variables (age, metallicity, etc.) can be held constant.

We employ an all-sky sample, comprising of equation15\,000 stars, to determine empirical relationships between luminosity, temperature and radius. This is accomplished using only geometric distances and multiwave-band photometry, by utilising a modified spectral energy distribution fitting method. The radii we measure show an inflation of equation compared to models, but no more than a equation intrinsic spread in the inflated sequence. We show that we are currently able to determine M-dwarf radii to an accuracy of equation using our method.

Ionized regions in the torus midplane are found to be either gravitationally trapped or in pressure driven expansion depending on whether or not the size of the ionized region exceeds a critical radius. Trapped Hii regions in the torus plane allow accretion to progress, while expanding Hii regions disrupt the accretion torus preventing the central star from aggregating more mass, thereby setting the star's final mass.

1905.10156,astro-ph,"The largest galaxy clusters are observed still to be forming through major cluster-cluster mergers, often showing observational signatures such as radio relics and giant radio haloes. Using LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey data, we present new detections of both a radio halo (with a spectral index of equation) and a likely radio relic in Abell 959, a massive cluster at a redshift of z=0.288. Using a sample of clusters with giant radio haloes from the literature (80 in total), we show that the radio halo in A959 lies reasonably well on the scaling relations between the thermal and non-thermal power of the system. Additionally, we find evidence that steep-spectrum haloes tend to reside in clusters with high X-ray luminosities relative to those expected from cluster LM scaling relations, indicating that such systems may preferentially lie at an earlier stage of the merger, consistent with the theory that some steep-spectrum haloes result from low-turbulence mergers. Lastly, we find that halo systems containing radio relics tend to lie at lower X-ray luminosities, relative to those expected from cluster LM scaling relations, for a given halo radio power than those without relics, suggesting that the presence of relics indicates a later stage of the merger, in line with simulations.",2019,[],5
1906.00516,astro-ph,"We develop a novel method to explore the galaxy-halo connection using the galaxy imaging surveys by modeling the projected two-point correlation function measured from the galaxies with reasonable photometric redshift measurements. By assuming a Gaussian form of the photometric redshift errors, we are able to simultaneously constrain the halo occupation distribution (HOD) models and the effective photometric redshift uncertainties. Tests with mock galaxy catalogs demonstrate that this method can successfully recover (within equation) the intrinsic large-scale galaxy bias, as well as the HOD models and the effective photometric redshift uncertainty. This method also works well even for galaxy samples with 10 per cent catastrophic photometric redshift errors.",2019,[],5
1910.04271,astro-ph,"Massive protostars generate strong radiation feedback, which may help set the mass they achieve by the end of the accretion process. Studying such feedback is therefore crucial for understanding the formation of massive stars. We report the discovery of a photoionized bipolar outflow towards the massive protostar G45.470.05 using high-resolution observations at 1.3 mm with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) and at 7 mm with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). By modeling the free-free continuum, the ionized outflow is found to be a photoevaporation flow with an electron temperature of 10,000 K and an electron number density of ~1.5x107 cm-3 at the center, launched from a disk of radius of 110 au. H30alpha hydrogen recombination line emission shows strong maser amplification, with G45 being one of very few sources to show such millimeter recombination line masers. The mass of the driving source is estimated to be 30-50 Msun based on the derived ionizing photon rate, or 30-40 Msun based on the H30alpha kinematics. The kinematics of the photoevaporated material is dominated by rotation close to the disk plane, while accelerated to outflowing motion above the disk plane. The mass loss rate of the photoevaporation outflow is estimated to be ~(2-3.5)x10-5 Msun/yr. We also found hints of a possible jet embedded inside the wide-angle ionized outflow with non-thermal emissions. The possible co-existence of a jet and a massive photoevaporation outflow suggests that, in spite of the strong photoionization feedback, accretion is still on-going.",2019,[],5
1903.06158,astro-ph,"Young massive clusters (YMCs) are the most compact, high-mass stellar systems still forming at the present day. The precursor clouds to such systems are, however, rare due to their large initial gas mass reservoirs and rapid dispersal timescales due to stellar feedback. Nonetheless, unlike their high-z counterparts, these precursors are resolvable down to the sites of individually forming stars, and hence represent the ideal environments in which to test the current theories of star and cluster formation. Using high angular resolution (1equation / 0.05pc) and sensitivity ALMA observations of two YMC progenitor clouds in the Galactic Centre, we have identified a suite of molecular line transitions -- e.g. c-CequationHequation(equation) -- that are believed to be optically thin, and reliably trace the gas structure in the highest density gas on star-forming core scales. We conduct a virial analysis of the identified core and proto-cluster regions, and show that half of the cores (5/10) and both proto-clusters are unstable to gravitational collapse. This is the first kinematic evidence of global gravitational collapse in YMC precursor clouds at such an early evolutionary stage. The implications are that if these clouds are to form YMCs, then they likely do so via the ""conveyor-belt"" mode, whereby stars continually form within dispersed dense gas cores as the cloud undergoes global gravitational collapse. The concurrent contraction of both the cluster-scale gas and embedded (proto)stars ultimately leads to the high (proto)stellar density in YMCs.",2019,[],5
1902.00326,astro-ph,"Magnetic, chemically peculiar stars are known for exhibiting surface abundance inhomogeneities (chemical spots) that lead to photometric and spectroscopic variability with the rotation period. It is commonly assumed that the surface structures are causally connected with the global magnetic field that dominates the photospheric and subphotospheric layers of these stars. As a rule, the observed magnetic fields show a simple dipole-like geometry, with the magnetic axis being noncollinear to the rotational one. The present study aims at detecting underlying patterns in the distribution of photometric spots in a sample of 650 magnetic, chemically peculiar stars and examines their link to the magnetic field topology. Photometric time-series observations from the ASAS-3 archive were employed to inspect the light-curve morphology of our sample stars and divide them into representative classes described using a principal component analysis. Theoretical light curves were derived from numerous simulations assuming different spot parameters and following the symmetry of a simple dipole magnetic field. These were subsequently compared with the observed light curves. The results from our simulations are in contradiction with the observations and predict a much higher percentage of doublewave light curves than is actually observed. We thereby conclude that the distribution of the chemical spots does not follow the magnetic field topology, which indicates that the role of the magnetic field in the creation and maintenance of the surface structures may be more subsidiary than what is predicted by theoretical studies.",2019,[],5

1903.11662,astro-ph,"We have used the capability of the MUSE instrument to explore the impact of stellar feedback at large scales in Haro 11, a galaxy under extreme starburst condition and one of the first galaxies where Lyman continuum (LyC) has been detected. Using Ha, [OIII] and [OI] emission lines from deep MUSE observations, we have constructed a sequence of velocity-dependent maps of the Ha emission, the state of the ionised gas and a tracer of fast shocks. These allowed us to investigate the ionisation structure of the galaxy in 50 kms2 bins over a velocity range of -400 to 350 kms. The ionised gas in Haro 11 is assembled by a rich arrangement of structures, such as superbubbles, filaments, arcs and galactic ionised channels, whose appearances change drastically with velocity. The central star forming knots and the star forming dusty arm are the main engines that power the strong mechanical feedback in this galaxy, although with different impact on the ionisation structure. Haro 11 appears to leak LyC radiation in many directions. We found evidence of a kpc-scale fragmented superbubble, that may have cleared galactic-scale channels in the ISM. Additionally, the southwestern hemisphere is highly ionised in all velocities, hinting at a density bound scenario. A compact kpc-scale structure of lowly ionised gas coincides with the diffuse Lya emission and the presence of fast shocks. Finally, we find evidence that a significant fraction of the ionised gas mass may escape the gravitational potential of the galaxy.",2019,[],5

This technique can search over 1010 possible asteroid trajectories in stacks of the order 10-15 4K x 4K images in under a minute using a single consumer grade GPU. We apply this algorithm to data from the 2015 campaign of the High Cadence Transient Survey (HiTS) obtained with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). We find 39 previously unknown Kuiper Belt Objects in the 150 square degrees of the survey.

1909.10847,astro-ph,"Assessing the significance and implications of the recently established Hubble tension requires the comprehensive identification, quantification, and mitigation of uncertainties and/or biases affecting equation measurements. Here, we investigate the previously overlooked distance scale bias resulting from the interplay between redshift and Leavitt laws in an expanding Universe: Redshift-Leavitt bias (RLB). Redshift dilates oscillation periods of pulsating stars residing in supernova-host galaxies relative to periods of identical stars residing in nearby (anchor) galaxies. Multiplying dilated equation with Leavitt Law slopes leads to underestimated absolute magnitudes, overestimated distance moduli, and a systematic error on equation. Emulating the SH0ES distance ladder, we estimate an associated equation bias of equation% and obtain a corrected equation. RLB becomes increasingly relevant as distance ladder calibrations pursue greater numbers of ever more distant galaxies hosting both Cepheids (or Miras) and type-Ia supernovae. The measured periods of oscillating stars can readily be corrected for heliocentric redshift (e.g. of their host galaxies) in order to ensure equation measurements free of RLB.",2019,[],5
1903.06711,astro-ph,"Context: One of the greatest uncertainties in modelling the mass-exchange phases during the evolution of a binary system is the amount of mass and angular momentum that has been lost from the system. To constrain this problem, a favourable, evolved and detached real binary system is valuable as an example of the end result of this process. Aims: We study the 52-day post-mass-exchange eclipsing binary V643 Ori from complete uvby light curves and high-resolution spectra. V643 Ori is a double-lined, circular orbit, synchronized binary showing total primary eclipses. Results: We determine accurate masses of 3.3 and 1.9 M(Sun) and radii of 16 and 21 R(Sun). The masses and radii are incompatible with undisturbed post-main-sequence evolution. Conclusions: We have attempted to simulate the past evolutionary history of V643 Ori under both conservative and non-conservative Case B mass transfer scenarios. In the non-conservative case we varied the amounts of mass and angular momentum loss needed to arrive at the present masses in a circular 52-day orbit, keeping the two stars detached and synchronized as now observed, but without following the evolution of other stellar properties in any detail. Multiple possible solutions were found. Further attempts were made using both the BSE formalism and the binary MESA code in order to track stellar evolution more closely, and make use of the measured radii and temperatures as important additional constraints. Those efforts did not yield satisfactory solutions, possibly due to limitations in handling mass transfer in evolved stars such as these. We remain hopeful that future theoreticians can more fully model the system under realistic conditions.",2019,[],5
1912.06266,astro-ph,"133P/Elst-Pizarro is the firstly recognized main-belt comet, but we still know little about its nucleus. Firstly we use mid-infrared data of Spitzer-MIPS, Spitzer-IRS and WISE to estimate its effective diameter equation km, geometric albedo equation and mean Bond albedo equation. The albedo is used to compute 133P's temperature distribution, which shows significant seasonal variation, especially polar regions, ranging from equation to equation K. Based on current activity observations, the maximum water gas production rate is estimated to be equation, being far weaker than equation of JFC 67P at similar helio-centric distance equation AU, indicating a thick dust mantle on the surface to lower down the gas production rate. The diameter of the sublimation area may be equation m according to our model prediction. We thus propose that 133P's activity is more likely to be caused by sublimation of regional near-surface ice patch rather than homogeneous buried ice layer. Such small near-surface ice patch might be exposed by one impact event, before which 133P may be an extinct comet (or ice-rich asteroid) with ice layer buried below equation40 m depth. The proposed ice patch may be located somewhere within latitude equation by comparing theoretical variation of sublimation temperature to the constraints from observations. The time scale to form such a thick dust mantle is estimated to be equation Myr, indicating that 133P may be more likely to be a relatively old planetesimals or a member of an old family than a recently formed fragment of some young family.",2019,[],5

1901.06205,astro-ph,"Theories suggest that filament fragmentation should occur on a characteristic fragmentation length-scale. This fragmentation length-scale can be related to filament properties, such as the width and the dynamical state of the filament. Here we present a study of a number of fragmentation analysis techniques applied to filaments, and their sensitivity to characteristic fragmentation length-scales. We test the sensitivity to both single-tier and two-tier fragmentation, i.e. when the fragmentation can be characterised with one or two fragmentation length-scales respectively. The nearest neighbour separation, minimum spanning tree separation and two-point correlation function are all able to robustly detect characteristic fragmentation length-scales. The Fourier power spectrum and the Nth nearest neighbour technique are both poor techniques, and require very little scatter in the core spacings for the characteristic length-scale to be successfully determined. We develop a null hypothesis test to compare the results of the nearest neighbour and minimum spanning tree separation distribution with randomly placed cores. We show that a larger number of cores is necessary to successfully reject the null hypothesis if the underlying fragmentation is two-tier, N>20. Once the null is rejected we show how one may decide if the observed fragmentation is best described by single-tier or two-tier fragmentation, using either Akaike's information criterion or the Bayes factor. The analysis techniques, null hypothesis tests, and model selection approaches are all included in a new open-source Python/C library called FragMent.",2019,[],5
1909.02591,astro-ph,"We present 0.25 arcsec resolution (35 au) ALMA 1.3 mm dust polarization observations for 37 young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Ophiuchus cloud. These data encompass all the embedded protostars in the cloud and several Flat and Class II objects to produce the largest, homogeneous study of dust polarization on disk scales to date. The goal of this study is to study dust polarization down to disk scales. We find that 14/37 (38%) of the YSOs are detected in polarization. Nine of these sources have uniform polarization angles and four sources have azimuthal polarization. The sources with uniform polarization tend to have steeper inclinations (> 60 degree) than those with azimuthal polarization (< 60 degree). The majority (9/14) of the detected sources have polarization morphologies and disk properties consistent with dust self-scattering in optically thick disks. The remaining sources may be instead tracing magnetic fields. Their inferred field directions from rotating the polarization vectors by 90 degree are mainly poloidal or hourglass shaped. We find no evidence of a strong toroidal field component toward any of our disks. For the 23 YSOs that are undetected in polarization, roughly half of them have 3-sigma upper limits of < 2%. These sources also tend to have inclinations < 60 degree and they are generally compact. Since lower inclination sources tend to have azimuthal polarization, these YSOs may be undetected in polarization due to unresolved polarization structure within our beam. We propose that disks with inclinations > 60 degree are the best candidates for future polarization studies of dust self-scattering as these systems will generally show uniform polarization vectors that do not require very high resolution to resolve. We release the continuum and polarization images for all the sources with this publication. Data from the entire survey can be obtained from Dataverse.",2019,[],5

1909.08639,astro-ph,"The advent of high-angular resolution IR and sub-mm interferometry allows for spatially-resolved observations of the parsec-scale environment of active galactic nuclei (AGN), commonly referred to as the ""torus."" While molecular lines show the presence of large, massive disks, the IR observations appear to be dominated by a strong polar component that has been interpreted as a dusty wind. This paper aims at using characteristics shared by AGN in each of the wavebands and a set of simple physical principles to form a unifying view of these seemingly contradictory observations: Dusty molecular gas flows in from galactic scales of ~100 pc to the sub-parsec environment via a disk with small to moderate scale height. The hot, inner part of the disk puffs up due to IR radiation pressure and unbinds a large amount of the inflowing gas from the black hole's gravitational potential, providing the conditions to launch a wind driven by the radiation pressure from the AGN. The dusty wind feeds back mass into the galaxy at a rate of the order of ~0.1-100 equation/yr, depending on AGN luminosity and Eddington ratio. Angle-dependent obscuration as required by AGN unification is provided by a combination of disk, wind, and wind launching region.",2019,[],5
1906.07200,astro-ph,"Cosmic rays (CRs) are frequently modeled as an additional fluid in hydrodynamic (HD) and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of astrophysical flows. The standard CR two-fluid model is described in terms of three conservation laws (expressing conservation of mass, momentum and total energy) and one additional equation (for the CR pressure) that cannot be cast in a satisfactory conservative form. The presence of non-conservative terms with spatial derivatives in the model equations prevents a unique weak solution behind a shock. We investigate a number of methods for the numerical solution of the two-fluid equations and find that, in the presence of shock waves, the results depend on the choice of the numerical methods (spatial reconstruction, time stepping, and the CFL number) and the adopted discretization. Nevertheless, all methods converge to a unique result only if the energy partition between the thermal and non-thermal fluids at the shock is prescribed a priori. This highlights the closure problem of the two-fluid equations at shocks. We suggest a robust method where the solutions are insensitive to the numerical method.

1901.11297,astro-ph,"We present an approach that is able to both rapidly assess the dynamical stability of multiple planet systems, and determine whether an exoplanet system would be capable of hosting a dynamically stable Earth-mass companion in its habitable zone. We conduct a suite of numerical simulations using a swarm of massless test particles in the vicinity of the orbit of a massive planet, in order to develop a predictive tool which can be used to achieve these desired outcomes. In this work, we outline both the numerical methods we used to develop the tool, and demonstrate its use. We find that the test particles survive in systems either because they are unperturbed due to being so far removed from the massive planet, or due to being trapped in stable mean motion resonant orbits with the massive planet. The resulting unexcited test particle swarm produces a unique signature in (a,e) space that represents the stable regions within the system. We are able to scale and translate this stability signature, and combine several together in order to conservatively assess the dynamical stability of newly discovered multiple planet systems.

1901.02310,astro-ph,"Whilst there are observational indications that transverse MHD waves carry enough energy to maintain the thermal structure of the solar corona, it is not clear whether such energy can be efficiently and effectively converted into heating. Phase-mixing of Alfv\'en waves is considered a candidate mechanism, as it can develop transverse gradient where magnetic energy can be converted into thermal energy. However, phase-mixing is a process that crucially depends on the amplitude and period of the transverse oscillations, and only recently have we obtained a complete measurement of the power spectrum for transverse oscillations in the corona. We aim to investigate the heating generated by phase-mixing of transverse oscillations triggered by buffeting of a coronal loop that follows from the observed coronal power spectrum as well as the impact of these persistent oscillations on the structure of coronal loops. We consider a 3D MHD model of an active region coronal loop and we perturb its footpoints with a 2D horizontal driver that represents a random buffeting motion of the loop footpoints. Our driver is composed of 1000 pulses superimposed to generate the observed power spectrum. We find that the heating supply from the observed power spectrum in the solar corona through phase mixing is not sufficient to maintain the million degree active region solar corona. We also find that the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities could be a common phenomenon in coronal loops that could affect their apparent life time. This study concludes that is unlikely that phase-mixing of Alfv\'en waves resulting from an observed power spectrum of transverse coronal loop oscillations can heat the active region solar corona.

Both species exhibit periodic flux variations that correlate with the central star's optical light curve, with a phase delay of up to 0.15 for the maser flux variations with respect to the optical light curve. The flux densities of SiO v = 2, J = 1-0 and H2O masers decrease with time, implying that they may disappear in 10-20 years. However, there seems to have been a transient episode of intense H2O maser emission around 2010. We also found a systematic behaviour in the velocity profiles of these masers. The velocities of the H2O maser components appear to be remarkably constant, suggesting ballistic motion for the bipolar outflow in this nebula. On the other hand, those of the SiO maser clumps show a systematic radial acceleration of the individual clumps, converging to the outflow velocity of the H2O maser clumps. Measuring the full widths at zero power of the detected lines, we estimated the expansion velocities of the compact bipolar outflow traced by H2O maser and SiO thermal line, and discussed the possibility of the expanding SiO maser region in the equatorial direction.

1901.02798,astro-ph,"Recent observations at high spatial resolution have shown that magnetic flux cancellation occurs on the solar surface much more frequently than previously thought, and so this led Priest et al 2018 to propose magnetic reconnection driven by photospheric flux cancellation as a mechanism for chromospheric and coronal heating. In particular, they estimated analytically the amount of energy released as heat and the height of the energy release during flux cancellation. In the present work, we take the next step in the theory by setting up a two-dimensional resistive MHD simulation of two canceling polarities in the presence of a horizontal external field and a stratified atmosphere in order to check and improve upon the analytical estimates. Computational evaluation of the energy release during reconnection is found to be in good qualitative agreement with the analytical estimates. In addition, we go further and undertake an initial study of the atmospheric response to reconnection. We find that, during the cancellation, either hot ejections or cool ones or a combination of both hot and cool ejections can be formed, depending on the height of the reconnection location. The hot structures can have the density and temperature of coronal loops, while the cooler structures are suggestive of surges and large spicules.",2019,[],5
1901.05354,astro-ph,"Globular Clusters (GCs) have historically been subdivided in either two (disk/halo) or three (disk/inner-halo/outer-halo) groups based on their orbital, chemical and internal physical properties. The qualitative nature of this subdivision makes it impossible to determine whether the natural number of groups is actually two, three, or more. In this paper we use cluster analysis on the equation space to show that the intrinsic number of GC groups is actually either equation or equation, with the latter being favored albeit non-significantly. In the equation case, the Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) clustering algorithm recovers a metal-poor halo GC group and a metal-rich disk GC group. With equation the three groups can be interpreted as disk/inner-halo/outer-halo families. For each group we obtain a medoid, i.e. a representative element (NGC equation, NGC equation, and NGC equation for the disk, inner halo, and outer halo respectively), and a measure of how strongly each GC is associated to its group, the so-called silhouette width. Using the latter, we find a correlation with age for both disk and outer halo GCs where the stronger the association of a GC with the disk (outer halo) group, the younger (older) it is.",2019,[],5
1902.08840,astro-ph,"We have developed the first gas-grain chemical model for oxygen fractionation (also including sulphur fractionation) in dense molecular clouds, demonstrating that gas-phase chemistry generates variable oxygen fractionation levels, with a particularly strong effect for NO, SO, O2, and SO2. This large effect is due to the efficiency of the neutral 18O  NO, 18O  SO, and 18O  O2 exchange reactions. The modeling results were compared to new and existing observed isotopic ratios in a selection of cold cores. The good agreement between model and observations requires that the gas-phase abundance of neutral oxygen atoms is large in the observed regions. The S16O/S18O ratio is predicted to vary substantially over time showing that it can be used as a sensitive chemical proxy for matter evolution in dense molecular clouds.",2019,[],5
1906.03643,astro-ph,"Our knowledge and understanding of the Universe is mainly based on observations of the electromagnetic radiation in a wide range of wavelengths. Only during the past two decades, new kinds of detectors have been developed, exploiting other forms of cosmic probes: individual photons with energy above the GeV, charged particles and antiparticles, neutrinos and, finally, gravitational waves. These new 'telescopes' leaded to unexpected breakthroughs. Years 2016 and 2017 have seen the dawn of the astrophysics and cosmology with gravitational waves, awarded with the 2017 Nobel Prize. The events GW150914 (the first black hole-black hole merger) and GW170817 (the coalescence of two neutron stars, producing a short gamma-ray burst and follow-up observed by more than 70 observatories on all continents and in space) represent really milestones in science that every physicist (senior or in formation) should appreciate.   In this document, after an accessible discussion on the generation and propagation of GWs, the key features of observable quantities (the strain, the GW frequency equation, and equation) of GW150914 and GW170817 are discussed using Newtonian physics, dimensional analysis and analogies with electromagnetic waves. The objective is to show how astrophysical quantities (the initial and final masses of merging objects, the energy loss, the distance, their spin) are derived from observables. The results from the fully general-relativistic analysis published in the two discovery papers are compared with the output of our simple treatment. Then, some of the outcomes of GW observations are discussed in terms of multimessenger astrophysics.",2019,[],5
1907.01338,astro-ph,"We present further evidence of the presence of acoustic oscillations on the slowly-rotating, over-active G8 sub-giant EK Eri. This star was observed with the 1-m Hertzsprung SONG telescope, at the Observatorio del Teide for two different runs of 8 and 13 nights, respectively, and separated by about a year. We determined a significant excess of power around equationHz in the first observing run and we were able to determine the large separation equationHz. No significant excess of power was instead detected in a subsequent SONG observing season, as also supported by our analysis of the simultaneous TESS photometric observations. We propose a new amplitude-luminosity relation in order to account for the missing power in the power spectrum. Based on the evolutionary stage of this object we argue that standard equation dynamo cannot be excluded as a possible origin for the observed magnetic field.",2019,[],5
1909.12588,astro-ph,"The mJy variable extragalactic radio sky is known to be broadly non-changing with approximately equation of persistent radio sources exhibiting variability which is largely AGN-related. In the faint (<mJy) flux density regime, it is widely accepted that the radio source population begins to change from AGN dominated to star-formation dominated, together with an emergent radio-quiet AGN component. Very little is known about the variable source component in this sub-mJy regime. In this paper, we provide the first insight into the equationJy variable sky by performing a careful analysis using deep VLA data in the well studied GOODS-N field. Using five epochs spread across 22 years, we investigate approximately 480 radio sources finding 10 which show signs of variability. We attribute this variability to the presence of an AGN in these systems. We confirm and extend the results of previous surveys, finding that variability in the faint radio sky is rather modest with only equation2\% of sources exhibiting significant variability between any two epochs. We find that 70\% of variable sources show variability on timescales of a few days whilst on longer decadal time-scales, the fraction of variable sources decreases to equation. This suggests that the radio variability peaks on shorter timescales as suggested by other studies. We find that 80\% of variable sources have VLBI counterparts, and we use multi-wavelength data to infer that these may well be core-dominated FR-I sources as postulated by wide-field VLBI surveys and semi-empirical simulations.",2019,[],5
1907.00034,astro-ph,"We discuss the potential of detecting thermal neutrinos from matter-rich binary mergers, via a decades-long multi-messenger campaign involving a Mt-scale water Cherenkov neutrino detector and one or more next generation gravitational wave detectors, capable of observing mergers up to redshift equation. The search of neutrinos in time-coincidence with gravitational wave detections will allow to identify single neutrinos from individual mergers above the background, and to study their distributions in energy, redshift and type (double neutron-star or neutron-star-black hole merger) of the candidate sources. We find that, for merger rates consistent with current LIGO-Virgo constraints, and for a equation exposure, between equation and equation neutrino events are expected. For extreme cases of mergers with more than equation ergs emitted in equation, the number of events can be as large as equation, with sensitivity to mergers up to redshift equation or so. Such scenarios can already be tested with a equation exposure, resulting in constraints on the post-merger evolution of the systems being considered.",2019,[],5
1910.01151,astro-ph,"Compact, continuously launched jets in black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) produce radio to optical-infrared synchrotron emission. In most BHXBs, an infrared (IR) excess (above the disc component) is observed when the jet is present in the hard spectral state. We investigate why some BHXBs have prominent IR excesses and some do not, quantified by the amplitude of the IR quenching or recovery over the transition from/to the hard state. We find that the amplitude of the IR excess can be explained by inclination dependent beaming of the jet synchrotron emission, and the projected area of the accretion disc. Furthermore, we see no correlation between the expected and the observed IR excess for Lorentz factor 1, which is strongly supportive of relativistic beaming of the IR emission, confirming that the IR excess is produced by synchrotron emission in a relativistic outflow. Using the amplitude of the jet fade and recovery over state transitions and the known orbital parameters, we constrain for the first time the bulk Lorentz factor range of compact jets in several BHXBs (with all the well-constrained Lorentz factors lying in the range of equation = 1.3 - 3.5). Under the assumption that the Lorentz factor distribution of BHXB jets is a power-law, we find that N(equation) equation. We also find that the very high amplitude IR fade/recovery seen repeatedly in the BHXB GX 339-4 favors a low inclination angle (equation) of the jet.",2019,[],5
1906.10138,astro-ph,"We analyze extensive spectroscopic and photometric data of the hypervariable quasar SDSS J131424530527 (RMID 017) at z=0.456, an optical ""changing look"" quasar from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping project that increased in optical luminosity by a factor of 10 between 2014 and 2017. The observed broad emission lines all respond in luminosity and width to the changing optical continuum, as expected for photoionization in a stratified, virialized broad emission line region. The luminosity changes therefore result from intrinsic changes in accretion power rather than variable obscuration. The variability is continuous and apparently stochastic, disfavoring an origin as a discrete event such as a tidal disruption flare or microlensing event. It is coordinated on day timescales with blue leading red, consistent with reprocessing powering the entire optical SED. We show that this process cannot work in a standard thin disk geometry on energetic grounds, and would instead require a large covering factor reprocessor. Disk instability models could potentially also explain the data, provided that the instability sets in near the inner radius of a geometrically thick accretion disk.",2019,[],5
1904.02161,astro-ph,"Weak magnetic fields have recently been detected in a number of A-type stars, including Vega and Sirius. At the same time, space photometry observations of A- and late B-type stars from Kepler and TESS have highlighted the existence of rotational modulation of surface features akin to stellar spots. Here we explore the possibility that surface magnetic spots might be caused by the presence of small envelope convective layers at or just below the stellar surface, caused by recombination of H and He. Using 1D stellar evolution calculations and assuming an equipartition dynamo, we make simple estimates of field strength at the photosphere. For most models the largest effects are caused by a convective layer driven by second helium ionization. While it is difficult to predict the geometry of the magnetic field, we conclude that the majority of intermediate-mass stars should have dynamo-generated magnetic fields of order a few gauss at the surface. These magnetic fields can appear at the surface as bright spots, and cause photometric variability via rotational modulation, which could also be wide-spread in A-stars. The amplitude of surface magnetic fields and their associated photometric variability is expected to decrease with increasing stellar mass and surface temperature, so that magnetic spots and their observational effects should be much harder to detect in late B-type stars.",2019,[],5
1902.09613,astro-ph,"The aim of our study is to explore the possible existence of Earth-mass planets in the habitable zone of 55~Cancri, an effort pursued based on detailed orbital stability simulations. This star is known to possess (at least) five planets with masses ranging between super-Earth and Jupiter-type. Additionally, according to observational constraints, there is a space without planets between equation0.8~au and equation5.7~au, noting that the inner part of this gap largely coincides with 55~Cnc's habitable zone --- a sincere motivation for the search of potentially habitable planets. It has previously been argued that terrestrial habitable planets are able to exist in the 55~Cnc system, including a planet at equation1.5~au. We explore this possibility through employing sets of orbital integrations and assuming an integration time of 50~Myr. We found that the possibility of Earth-mass planets in the system's habitable zone strongly depends on the adopted system parameters, notably the eccentricity of 55~Cnc-f, which is controversial as both a high value (equation) and a low value (equation) have previously been deduced. In case that the low value is adopted (together with other updates for the system parameters), the more plausible and most recent value, Earth-mass planets would be able to exist in the gap between 1.0~au and 2.0~au, thus implying the possibility of habitable system planets. Thus, 55~Cnc should be considered a favorable target for future habitable planet search missions.",2019,[],5
1903.12580,astro-ph,"The investigation of distant galaxy formation and evolution is a powerful tool to constrain dark matter scenarios, supporting and in some cases surpassing other astrophysical and experimental probes. The recent completion of the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) programme combining ultra-deep Hubble Space Telescope observations and the magnification power of gravitational lensing produced by foreground galaxy clusters has enabled the detection of the faintest primordial galaxies ever studied. Here we show how the number density of such primordial galaxies allows to constrain a variety of DM models alternative to CDM. In particular, it provides stringent limits on the mass of thermal WDM candidates, on the parameter space of sterile neutrino production models, and on other DM scenarios featuring particles in the keV mass range which is also supported by recent detections of a 3.5keV X-ray line. These constraints are robust and independent of the baryonic physics modeling of galaxy formation and evolution. Fuzzy DM (ultralight DM particles) results strongly disfavored.",2019,[],5
1909.01404,astro-ph,"The presence of star-to-star light-element abundance variations (a.k.a. multiple populations, MPs) appears to be ubiquitous within old and massive clusters in the Milky Way and all studied nearby galaxies. Most previous studies have focussed on resolved images or spectroscopy of individual stars, although there has been significant effort in the past few years to look for multiple population signatures in integrated light spectroscopy. If proven feasible, integrated light studies offer a potential way to vastly open parameter space, as clusters out to tens of Mpc can be studied. We use the NaD lines in the integrated spectra of two clusters with similar ages (equation Gyr) but very different masses, NGC 1978 (equation Msun) in the LMC and G114 (equation Msun) in NGC 1316. For NGC 1978, our findings agree with resolved studies of individual stars which did not find evidence for Na spreads. However, for G114, we find clear evidence for the presence of multiple populations. The fact that the same anomalous abundance patterns are found in both the intermediate age and ancient GCs lends further support to the notion that young massive clusters are effectively the same as the ancient globular clusters, only separated in age.",2019,[],5
1904.12788,astro-ph,"Annual oscillations have been detected in many indices of solar activity during many cycles. Recent multi spacecraft observations of coronal bright points revealed slow retrograde toroidal phase drift (with the speed of 3 m/s of 1 yr oscillations, which naturally suggested their connection with Rossby-type waves in the interior. We have studied from a theoretical point of view the dynamics of global magneto-Kelvin and magneto-Rossby waves in the solar tachocline with toroidal magnetic field. Using spherical coordinates, the dispersion relations of the waves and latitudinal structure of solutions were obtained analytically. We have also obtained the spectrum of unstable magneto-Rossby wave harmonics in the presence of the latitudinal differential rotation. Estimated periods and phase speeds show that the magneto-Rossby waves rather than the Kelvin waves match with the observations of 1 yr oscillations. On the other hand, Morlet wavelet analysis of Greenwich Royal Observatory sunspot areas for the solar cycle 23 has revealed multiple periodicities with periods of 450-460 days, 370-380 days, 310-320 days, 240-270 days, and 150-175 days in hemispheric and full disk data. Comparison of theoretical results with the observations allow us to conclude that the global magneto-Kelvin waves in the upper overshoot tachocline may be responsible for the periodicity of 450-460 days (1.3 yrs), while the remaining periods can be connected with different harmonics of global fast magneto-Rossby waves.",2019,[],5

1910.00554,astro-ph,"Millisecond magnetars are often invoked as the central engine of some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), specifically the ones showing a plateau phase. We argue that an apparent plateau phase may not be realized if the magnetic field of the nascent magnetar is in a transient rapid decay stage. Some GRBs that lack a clear plateau phase may also be hosting millisecond magnetars. We present an approximate analytical solution of the coupled set of equations describing the evolution of the angular velocity and the inclination angle between rotation and magnetic axis of a neutron star in the presence of a co-rotating plasma. We also show how the solution can be generalized to the case of evolving magnetic fields. We determine the evolution of the spin period, inclination angle, magnetic dipole moment and braking index of six putative magnetars associated with GRB 091018, GRB 070318, GRB 080430, GRB 090618, GRB 110715A, GRB 140206A through fitting, via Bayesian analysis, the X-ray afterglow light curves by using our recent model [\cSa\csmaz Mu\cs et al. 2019].

That high velocity of the wind in our picture is related to the preshock gas accelerated by the cosmic ray precursor. The modelling of the circumstellar interaction results in the wind density parameter equation that being combined with the wind velocity suggests the presupernova mass loss rate of equation yrequation. The wind density is consistent with the [Fe X] 6374 \AA\ luminosity. The model Hequation luminosity also agrees with the observational value.

1911.11778,astro-ph,"We present SPECULATOR - a fast, accurate, and flexible framework for emulating stellar population synthesis (SPS) models for predicting galaxy spectra and photometry. For emulating spectra, we use principal component analysis to construct a set of basis functions, and neural networks to learn the basis coefficients as a function of the SPS model parameters. For photometry, we parameterize the magnitudes (for the filters of interest) as a function of SPS parameters by a neural network. The resulting emulators are able to predict spectra and photometry under both simple and complicated SPS model parameterizations to percent-level accuracy, giving a factor of equation-equation speed up over direct SPS computation. They have readily-computable derivatives, making them amenable to gradient-based inference and optimization methods. The emulators are also straightforward to call from a GPU, giving an additional order-of-magnitude speed-up. Rapid SPS computations delivered by emulation offers a massive reduction in the computational resources required to infer the physical properties of galaxies from observed spectra or photometry and simulate galaxy populations under SPS models, whilst maintaining the accuracy required for a range of applications.",2019,[],5

The spectra obtained from all three nights appear featureless. No absorption features associated with water ice are detected. Spectral modeling suggests that water grains, if present, comprise no more than 10% of the coma cross-section.

1902.01213,astro-ph,"AM CVn binaries are a class of ultracompact, hydrogen-deficient binaries, each consisting of a white dwarf accreting helium-dominated material from a degenerate or semi-degenerate donor star. Of the 56 known systems, only Gaia14aae undergoes complete eclipses of its central white dwarf, allowing the parameters of its stellar components to be tightly constrained. Here, we present phase-resolved optical spectroscopy of Gaia14aae. We use the spectra to test the assumption that the narrow emission feature known as the `central spike' traces the motion of the central white dwarf. We measure a central spike velocity amplitude of equation km/s, which agrees at the 1 equation level with the predicted value of equation km/s based on eclipse-derived system parameters. The orbital phase offset of the central spike from its expected position is equation equation, consistent with 0 equation. Doppler maps of the He I lines in Gaia14aae show two accretion disc bright spots, as seen in many AM CVn systems. The formation mechanism for the second spot remains unclear. We detect no hydrogen in the system, but we estimate a 3 equation limit on Hequation emission with an equivalent width of -1.14 \AA.

1905.07222,astro-ph,"We have constructed and calibrated a spherically-symmetric, spatially-dependent particle transport and emission code for young pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe).

It also predicts the X-ray spectral index at different radii from the central pulsar, depending on the nebular B-field profile and particle transport properties. We apply the code to PWN G0.90.1 and fit these three functions concurrently, thus maximizing the constraining power of the data. We use a Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) method to find best-fit parameters with accompanying errors. This approach should allow us to better probe the spatial behaviour of the bulk-particle motion, the equation-field and diffusion coefficient, and break degeneracies between different model parameters.

Interestingly, most massive clusters -- globular cluster candidates -- are preferentially formed during major merger events. We follow the dynamical evolution of clusters in the galactic tidal field. Due to tidal disruption, the cluster mass function evolves from initial power law to a peaked shape. The surviving clusters at equation show a broad range of metallicity [Fe/H] from -3 to -0.5.

1911.02572,astro-ph,"We present simulations of galaxy formation, based on the GADGET-3 code, in which a sub-resolution model for star formation and stellar feedback is interfaced with a new model for AGN feedback. Our sub-resolution model describes a multiphase ISM, accounting for hot and cold gas within the same resolution element: we exploit this feature to investigate the impact of coupling AGN feedback energy to the different phases of the ISM over cosmic time. Our fiducial model considers that AGN feedback energy coupling is driven by the covering factors of the hot and cold phases. We perform a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of disc galaxies (equation Mequation, at equation), to investigate: equation the effect of different ways of coupling AGN feedback energy to the multiphase ISM; equation the impact of different prescriptions for gas accretion (i.e. only cold gas, both cold and hot gas, with the additional possibility of limiting gas accretion from cold gas with high angular momentum); equation how different models of gas accretion and coupling of AGN feedback energy affect the coevolution of supermassive BHs and their host galaxy. We find that at least a share of the AGN feedback energy has to couple with the diffuse gas, in order to avoid an excessive growth of the BH mass. When the BH only accretes cold gas, it experiences a growth that is faster than in the case in which both cold and hot gas are accreted. If the accretion of cold gas with high angular momentum is reduced, the BH mass growth is delayed, the BH mass at equation is reduced by up to an order of magnitude, and the BH is prevented from accreting below equation, when the galaxy disc forms.",2019,[],5

The time-averaged X-ray spectrum covering 0.6--168 keV was approximately characterized by a strong multi-color disk blackbody component with an inner disk temperature of ~0.6 keV, and a power-law tail with a photon index of ~2.0. We detected an additional structure at 5-10 keV, which can be modelled neither with X-ray reflection on the disk, nor relativistic broadening of the disk emission. Instead, it was successfully reproduced with a Comptonization of disk photons by thermal electrons with a relatively low temperature (<~10 keV). We infer that the source was in the intermediate state, considering its long-term trend in the hardness intensity diagram, the strength of the spectral power-law tail, and its variability properties. The low-temperature Comptonization component could be produced in a boundary region between the truncated standard disk and the hot inner flow, or a Comptonizing region that somehow developed above the disk surface.

1910.12557,astro-ph,"Stellar magnetic activity decays over the main-sequence life of cool stars due to the stellar spin-down driven by magnetic braking. The evolution of chromospheric emission is well-studied for younger stars, but difficulties in determining the ages of older cool stars on the main sequence have complicated such studies for older stars in the past. Here we report on chromospheric Ca II H and K line measurements for 26 main-sequence cool stars with asteroseismic ages older than a gigayear and spectral types F and G. We find that for the G stars and the cooler F-type stars which still have convective envelopes the magnetic activity continues to decrease at stellar ages above one gigayear. Our magnetic activity measurements do not show evidence for a stalling of the magnetic braking mechanism, which has been reported for stellar rotation versus age for G and F type stars. We also find that the measured R'HK indicator value for the cool F stars in our sample is lower than predicted by common age-activity relations that are mainly calibrated on data from young stellar clusters.

The majority of the SSC profiles is best-fitted by the Moffat-EFF profile. The scale parameter rd and the shape parameter gamma in the three filters are identical within the measurement errors. The analysed sample is big enough to allow characterisation of the distributions of core radii Rc and gamma. The obtained distribution of Rc follows a log-normal form, with center and sigma(log(Rc/pc)) being 1.73 pc and 0.25, respectively. The gamma distribution is also log-normal with center and sigma(log(gamma)) being 2.88 and 0.08, respectively. M82 is well-known for the absence of current star formation in its disk, with all disk SSCs older than 50 Myr and hardly any cluster older than ~300 Myr. The derived distributions compare very well with the distributions for intermediate-age clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which is also a low-mass late-type galaxy similar to M82. On the other hand, the distributions of Rc in both these galaxies are shifted towards larger values as compared to SSCs of similar age in the giant spiral galaxy M83.

By fitting models directly to the observed visibilities within a MCMC framework, we are able to characterize the millimeter continuum emission and place robust constraints on the disk structure and geometry. In the best-fit model of a power law disk with a Gaussian gap, the disk inner and outer edges are at equation AU (equation) and equation AU (equation), respectively, with a gap located at equation~AU (equation) with a fractional depth of equation and a width of equation AU (equation).

The main results are: \it i) The observed Salpeter power-law slope and normalisation of the stellar initial mass function at the high-mass end can be reproduced if we assume that each star-forming gas clump (sink particle) fragments into stars producing on average a maximum stellar mass about equation of the mass of the sink particle, while the remaining equation is distributed into smaller mass stars. Assuming that the sinks fragment according to a power-law mass function flatter than Salpeter, with log-slope equation, satisfy this empirical prescription. \it ii) The star formation law that best describes our set of simulation is equation if equation~cmequation, and equation otherwise. The duration of the star formation episode is roughly equation cloud's sound crossing times (with equation~km/s). \it iii) The total star formation efficiency in the cloud is equation, for gas at solar metallicity, while for metallicity equation~Zequation, based on our limited sample, equation is reduced by a factor of equation. \it iv) The most compact and massive clouds appear to form globular cluster progenitors, in the sense that star clusters remain gravitationally bound after the gas has been expelled.",2019,[],5
1906.08877,astro-ph,"A detailed understanding of how the activity of a galactic nucleus regulates the growth of its host is still missing. To understand the activity and the types of accretion of supermassive black holes in different hosts, it is essential to study radio-optical properties of a large sample of extragalactic sources. In particular, we aim at studying the radio spectral index trends across the optical emission line diagnostic diagrams to search for potential (anti)correlations. To this goal, we combine flux densities from the radio FIRST survey at equation (with the flux density range equation) for 209 SDSS sources at intermediate redshift equation with the Effelsberg radiotelescope measurements at equation and equation. The information about the optical emission-line ratios is obtained from the SDSS-DR7 catalogue. Using the Effelsberg data, we were able to infer the two-point radio spectral index distributions for star-forming galaxies, composite galaxies (with a combined contribution to the line emission from the star-formation and AGN activity), Seyferts, and low ionization narrow emission region (LINER) galaxies. While studying the distribution of steep, flat, and inverted sources across optical diagnostic diagrams, we found three distinct classes of radio emitters for our sample: (i) sources with steep radio index, high ionization ratio and high radio loudness, (ii) sources with flat radio index, lower ionization ratio and intermediate radio loudness, (iii) sources with inverted radio index, low ionization ratio and low radio loudness. The classes (i), (ii), (iii) cluster mainly along the transition from Seyfert to LINER sources in the BPT diagram. We interpret these groups as a result of the recurrent nuclear-jet activity.",2019,[],5

1907.06476,astro-ph,"A recent review shows that observations performed with different telescopes, spectral lines, and interpretation methods all agree about a vertical magnetic field gradient in solar active regions on the order of 3 G/km, when a horizontal magnetic field gradient of only 0.3 G/km is found. This represents an inexplicable discrepancy with respect to the divB=0 law. The objective of this paper is to explain these observations through the law B=letter0(HM) in magnetized media. Magnetization is due to plasma diamagnetism, which results from the spiral motion of free electrons or charges about the magnetic field. Their usual photospheric densities lead to very weak magnetization M, four orders of magnitude lower than H. It is then assumed that electrons escape from the solar interior, where their thermal velocity is much higher than the escape velocity, in spite of the effect of protons. They escape from lower layers in a quasi-static spreading, and accumulate in the photosphere. By evaluating the magnetic energy of an elementary atom embedded in the magnetized medium obeying the macroscopic law B=letter0(HM), it is shown that the Zeeman Hamiltonian is due to the effect of H. Thus, what is measured is H. The decrease in density with height is responsible for non-zero divergence of M, which is compensated for by the divergence of H, in order to ensure divB=0. The behavior of the observed quantities is recovered. The problem of the divergence of the observed magnetic field in solar active regions finally reveals evidence of electron accumulation in the solar photosphere. This is not the case of the heavier protons, which remain in lower layers. An electric field would thus be present in the solar interior, but as the total charge remains negligible, no electric field or effect would result outside the star.",2019,[],5
1907.13169,astro-ph,"Young terrestrial planets can capture or outgas hydrogen-rich atmospheres with tens to hundreds of bars of H2, which persist for 100 Myrs or longer. Although the earliest habitable conditions on Earth and terrestrial exoplanets could thus arise while the atmosphere is still dominated by H2, the climatic effects of H2 remain poorly understood. Previous work showed that H2 induces strong greenhouse warming at the outer edge of the habitable zone. Here we use a 1D radiative-convective model to show that H2 also leads to strong warming near the inner edge of the habitable zone. Unlike H2's greenhouse warming at the outer edge, however, its effect near the inner edge is driven by thermodynamics: H2's large thermal scale height allows the atmosphere to store more water vapor than either a pure-H2O atmosphere or an atmosphere with a heavy background gas, such as N2 or CO2, thereby amplifying the greenhouse effect of H2O. Using idealized grey calculations, we then present a general argument for how different background gases affect the inner edge of the habitable zone. H2 stands out for its ability to induce novel ""Souffle"" climates, which further support its warming effect. Our results show that if the earliest conditions on a planet near the inner edge of the habitable zone were H2-rich, they were likely also hot: 1 bar of H2 is sufficient to raise surface temperatures above 340 K, and 50 bar of H2 are sufficient to raise surface temperatures above 450 K.",2019,[],5
1905.04670,astro-ph,"The first detected gravitational wave GW170817 from a binary neutron star merger is associated with an important optical transient AT 2017gfo, which is a direct observation of kilonova. Recent observations suggest that the remnant compact object of the binary neutron star merger associated with GW170817/GRB 170817A may be a stable long-lived magnetized neutron star. In this situation, there would be a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) embedded inside the dynamic ejecta. The PWN emission may be absorbed by the ejecta or leak out of the system. We study the effect of the PWN emission on the observed light curves and radiation spectra. Different from previous works, the absorption and leakage of the PWN emission are all involved in our model, where the absorption of the PWN emission heats up the ejecta and alters its radiation. It is found that the characteristic emission of the embedded PWN quickly evolves. For the multiband and long-term observations of AT 2017gfo, we find that the dynamic ejecta with a PWN emission can fit the observational data very well, especially for the light curves at equation days and those in the late phase. In addition, our model can naturally generate the thermal to nonthermal spectrum evolution of AT 2017gfo. Our fitting result suggests that a PWN is embedded in the AT 2017gfo.",2019,[],5

1901.07562,astro-ph,"We observed seven epochs of spectropolarimetry in optical wavelengths for the Type IIb SN 2011hs, ranging from -3 to 40 days with respect to V -band maximum. A high degree of interstellar polarization was detected (up to ~3 percent), with a peak lying blueward of 4500A. Similar behaviours have been seen in some Type Ia SNe, but had never been observed in a Type IIb. We find that it is most likely the result of a relative enhancement of small silicate grains in the vicinity of the SN. Significant intrinsic continuum polarization was recovered at -3 and 2 days (p = 0.55 \- 0.12 percent and p = 0.75 \- 0.11 percent, respectively). We discuss the change of the polarization angle across spectral lines and in the continuum as diagnostics for the 3D structure of the ejecta. We see a gradual rotation by about -50 degree in the continuum polarization angle between -2 and 18 days after V - band maximum. A similar rotation in He I letter5876, H\alpha and the Ca II infrared triplet seems to indicate a strong influence of the global geometry on the line polarization features. The differences in the evolution of their respective loops on the Stokes q - u plane suggest that line specific geometries are also being probed. Possible interpretations are discussed and placed in the context of literature. We find that the spectropolarimetry of SN 2011hs is most similar to that of SN 2011dh, albeit with notable differences.",2019,[],5
1909.10429,astro-ph,"The formation of cold gas giants similar to Jupiter and Saturn in orbit and mass is a great challenge for planetesimal-driven core accretion models because the core growth rates far from the star are low. Here we model the growth and migration of single protoplanets that accrete planetesimals and gas. We integrated the core growth rate using fits in the literature to equation-body simulations, which provide the efficiency of accreting the planetesimals that a protoplanet migrates through. We take into account three constraints from the solar system and from protoplanetary discs: (1) the masses of the terrestrial planets and the comet reservoirs in Neptune's scattered disc and the Oort cloud are consistent with a primordial planetesimal population of a few Earth masses per AU, (2) evidence from the asteroid belt and the Kuiper belt indicates that the characteristic planetesimal diameter is 100 km, and (3) observations of protoplanetary discs indicate that the dust is stirred by weak turbulence; this gas turbulence also excites the inclinations of planetesimals. Our nominal model built on these constraints results in maximum protoplanet masses of equation Earth masses. Ignoring constraint (1) above, we show that even a planetesimal population of 1,000 Earth masses, corresponding to 50 Earth masses per AU, fails to produce cold gas giants (although it successfully forms hot and warm gas giants). We conclude that a massive planetesimal reservoir is in itself insufficient to produce cold gas giants. The formation of cold gas giants by planetesimal accretion additionally requires that planetesimals are small and that the turbulent stirring is very weak, thereby violating all three above constraints.",2019,[],5
1901.01857,astro-ph,"We present a detailed spectroscopic and photometric analysis of DA and DB white dwarfs drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with trigonometric parallax measurements available from the Gaia mission. The temperature and mass scales obtained from fits to equation photometry appear reasonable for both DA and DB stars, with almost identical mean masses of equation and equation, respectively. The comparison with similar results obtained from spectroscopy reveals several problems with our model spectra for both pure hydrogen and pure helium compositions. In particular, we find that the spectroscopic temperatures of DA stars exceed the photometric values by equation10% above equation~K, while for DB white dwarfs, we observe large differences between photometric and spectroscopic masses below equation~K. We attribute these discrepancies to the inaccurate treatment of Stark and van der Waals broadening in our model spectra, respectively. Despite these problems, the mean masses derived from spectroscopy --- equation and equation for the DA and DB stars, respectively --- agree extremely well with those obtained from photometry. Our analysis also reveals the presence of several unresolved double degenerate binaries, including DADA, DBDB, DADB, and even DADC systems. We finally take advantage of the Gaia parallaxes to test the theoretical mass-radius relation for white dwarfs. We find that 65% of the white dwarfs are consistent within the 1equation confidence level with the predictions of the mass-radius relation, thus providing strong support to the theory of stellar degeneracy.",2019,[],5
1910.09795,astro-ph,"Starting from our puzzling on-sky experience with the GIANO-TNG spectrometer we set up an infrared high resolution spectrometer in our laboratory and used this instrument to characterize the modal noise generated in fibers of different types (circular and octagonal) and sizes. Our experiment includes two conventional scrambling systems for fibers: a mechanical agitator and an optical double scrambler. We find that the strength of the modal noise primarily depends on how the fiber is illuminated. It dramatically increases when the fiber is under-illuminated, either in the near field or in the far field. The modal noise is similar in circular and octagonal fibers. The Fourier spectrum of the noise decreases exponentially with frequency; i.e., the modal noise is not white but favors broad spectral features. Using the optical double scrambler has no effect on modal noise. The mechanical agitator has effects that vary between different types of fibers and input illuminations. In some cases this agitator has virtually no effect. In other cases, it mitigates the modal noise, but flattens the noise spectrum in Fourier space; i.e., the mechanical agitator preferentially filters the broad spectral features. Our results show that modal noise is frustratingly insensitive to the use of octagonal fibers and optical double scramblers; i.e., the conventional systems used to improve the performances of spectrographs fed via unevenly illuminated fibers. Fiber agitation may help in some cases, but its effect has to be verified on a case-by-case basis. More generally, our results indicate that the design of the fiber link feeding a spectrograph should be coupled with laboratory measurements that reproduce, as closely as possible, the conditions expected at the telescope",2019,[],5
1909.08947,astro-ph,"We present a model for the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) VRO 42.05.01, suggesting that its intriguing morphology can be explained by a progenitor model of a supersonically moving, mass losing star.

The systemic motion of the parent star in combination with its asymmetric outflows excavated an extended wind bubble that revealed a similar structure to this of VRO 42.05.01. Currently the SNR is interacting with the wind bubble and it is dominantly shaped by it.

1909.03028,astro-ph,"EUSO-TA is a ground-based florescence detector built to validate the design of an ultra-high energy cosmic ray fluorescence detector to be operated in space.

With the external trigger provided by the Black Rock Mesa fluorescence detectors of Telescope Array (TA-FDs), EUSO-TA observed nine ultra-high energy cosmic ray events and several laser events from the Central Laser Facility of Telescope Array and portable lasers like the JEM-EUSO Global Light System prototype. The reconstruction parameters of the cosmic ray events which crossed the EUSO-TA field of view (both detected and not detected by EUSO-TA), were provided by the Telescope Array Collaboration. As the TA-FDs have a wider field of view than EUSO-TA (equation30 times larger), they allow the cosmic ray energy reconstruction based on the observation of most of the extensive air-shower profiles, including the shower maximum, while EUSO-TA only observes a portion of the showers, usually far from the maximum.

1904.12873,astro-ph,"Massive stars of helium cores of 35-65 Msun eventually encounter the electron/positron creation instability, and it triggers explosive carbon or oxygen burning that produces several thermonuclear eruptions. The resulting catastrophe collisions of eruptive shells sometimes produce luminous transients with peak luminosity of equation erg/sec, known as pulsational pair-instability supernovae (PPISNe). Previous 2D simulations of colliding shells show the development of Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities and mixing. Here we present radiation hydrodynamic PPISNe simulations of a 110 Msun solar-metallicity star that was promising to produce a superluminous transit in the early work. Our comprehensive study contains a suite of one-, two-, and three-dimensional models. We discuss the impact of dimensionality and fluid instabilities on the resulting light curves. The results show the RT mixing found in previous multidimensional hydro studies transforms into a thin and distorted shell due to radiative cooling. Radiation from the wiggly shell peaks at its bolometric light curve of equation erg/sec, lasting about 150 days and following with a plateau of equation erg/sec for another two hundred days before it fades away. The total radiation energy emitted from colliding shells is equation erg, which is equation of the kinetic energy of the major eruption. The dimensional effects also manifest on the physical properties, such as irregularity and thickness of the shell.

1904.12854,astro-ph,"Exomoons orbiting terrestrial or super-terrestrial exoplanets have not yet been discovered; their possible existence and properties are therefore still an unresolved question. Here we explore the collisional formation of exomoons through giant planetary impacts. We make use of smooth particle hydrodynamical (SPH) collision simulations and survey a large phase-space of terrestrial/super-terrestrial planetary collisions. We characterize the properties of such collisions, finding one rare case in which an exomoon forms through a graze&capture scenario, in addition to a few graze&merge or hit&run scenarios. Typically however, our collisions form massive circumplanetary discs, for which we use follow-up N-body simulations in order to derive lower-limit mass estimates for the ensuing exomoons. We investigate the mass, long-term tidal-stability, composition and origin of material in both the discs and the exomoons. Our giant-impact models often generate relatively iron-rich moons, that form beyond the synchronous radius of the planet, and would thus tidally evolve outward with stable orbits, rather than be destroyed. Our results suggest that it is extremely difficult to collisionally form currently-detectable exomoons orbiting super-terrestrial planets, through single giant impacts. It might be possible to form massive, detectable exomoons through several mergers of smaller exomoons, formed by multiple impacts, however more studies are required in order to reach a conclusion. Given the current observational initiatives, the search should focus primarily on more massive planet categories. However, about a quarter of the exomoons predicted by our models are approximately Mercury-mass or more, and are much more likely to be detectable given a factor 2 improvement in the detection capability of future instruments, providing further motivation for their development.",2019,[],5
1911.13081,astro-ph,"Dwarf galaxies found in isolation in the Local Group (LG) are unlikely to have interacted with the large LG spirals, and therefore environmental effects should not be the main drivers of their evolution. We aim to provide insight into the internal mechanisms shaping LG dwarf galaxies by increasing our knowledge of the internal properties of isolated systems. We focus on the evolved stellar component of the Aquarius dwarf, whose kinematic and metallicity properties have only recently started to be explored. We have obtained spectroscopic data in the the near-infrared CaII triplet lines region with FORS2 at the Very Large Telescope for 53 red giant branch (RGB) stars, to derive line-of-sight velocities and [Fe/H] of the individual RGB stars. We have derived a systemic velocity of equation km sequation, in agreement with previous measurements from both the HI gas and stars. The internal kinematics of Aquarius appears to be best modelled by a combination of random motions (l.o.s. velocity dispersion of equation km sequation) and linear rotation (with a gradient equation km sequation arcminequation) along a P.A.=equation deg, consistent with the optical projected major axis. This rotation signal is significantly misaligned or even counter-rotating to that derived from the HI gas. We also find the tentative presence of a mild negative metallicity gradient and indications that the metal-rich stars have a colder velocity dispersion than the metal-poor ones. This work represents a significant improvement with respect to previous measurements of the RGB stars of Aquarius, as it doubles the number of member stars studied in the literature. We speculate that the misaligned rotation between the HI gas and evolved stellar component might have been the result of recent accretion of HI gas or re-accretion after gas-loss due to internal stellar feedback.",2019,[],5

NRM observations were taken between 2013 and 2016 to characterize its performance. Most observations were taken in spectroscopic mode with the goal of obtaining precise astrometry and spectroscopy of faint companions to bright stars.

1909.09632,astro-ph,"Accurate photometric redshift calibration is central to the robustness of all cosmology constraints from cosmic shear surveys. Analyses of the KiDS re-weighted training samples from all overlapping spectroscopic surveys to provide a direct redshift calibration. Using self-organising maps (SOMs) we demonstrate that this spectroscopic compilation is sufficiently complete for KiDS, representing equation of the effective 2D cosmic shear sample. We use the SOM to define a equation represented `gold' cosmic shear sample, per tomographic bin. Using mock simulations of KiDS and the spectroscopic training set, we estimate the uncertainty on the SOM redshift calibration, and find that photometric noise, sample variance, and spectroscopic selection effects (including redshift and magnitude incompleteness) induce a combined maximal scatter on the bias of the redshift distribution reconstruction (equation) of equation in all tomographic bins. We show that the SOM calibration is unbiased in the cases of noiseless photometry and perfectly representative spectroscopic datasets, as expected from theory. The inclusion of both photometric noise and spectroscopic selection effects in our mock data introduces a maximal bias of equation, or equation at equation confidence, once quality flags have been applied to the SOM. The method presented here represents a significant improvement over the previously adopted direct redshift calibration implementation for KiDS, owing to its diagnostic and quality assurance capabilities. The implementation of this method in future cosmic shear studies will allow better diagnosis, examination, and mitigation of systematic biases in photometric redshift calibration.",2019,[],5

This relation is determined by the composition of the neutron star envelope and can be affected by the process of diffusive nuclear burning (DNB), which occurs when elements diffuse to depths where the density and temperature are sufficiently high to ignite nuclear burning. We calculate models of H-He and He-C envelopes that include DNB and obtain analytic temperature relations that can be used in neutron star cooling simulations. We find that DNB can lead to a rapidly changing envelope composition and prevents the build-up of thermally stable hydrogen columns yequation > 10equation g cmequation, while DNB can make helium envelopes more transparent to heat flux for surface temperatures equation > 2 equation K.

1903.08446,astro-ph,"Stellar surface magnetoconvection (granulation) creates asymmetries in the observed stellar absorption lines that can subsequently manifest themselves as spurious radial velocities shifts. In turn, this can then mask the Doppler-reflex motion induced by orbiting planets on their host stars, and represents a particular challenge for determining the masses of low-mass, long-period planets. Herein, we study this impact by creating Sun-as-a-star observations that encapsulate the granulation variability expected from 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. These Sun-as-a-star model observations are in good agreement with empirical observations of the Sun, but may underestimate the total variability relative to the quiet Sun due to the increased magnetic field strength in our models. We find numerous line profile characteristics linearly correlate with the disc-integrated convection-induced velocities. Removing the various correlations with the line bisector, equivalent width, and the Vasy indicator may reduce ~50-60% of the granulation noise in the measured velocities. We also find that simultaneous photometry may be a key diagnostic, as our proxy for photometric brightness also allowed us to remove ~50% of the granulation-induced radial velocity noise. These correlations and granulation-noise mitigations breakdown in the presence of low instrumental resolution and/or increased stellar rotation, as both act to smooth the observed line profile asymmetries.",2019,[],5

In Paper I, we showed that a with a set of six PCA basis vectors we could faithfully represent most optical spectra from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey;and we tested the accuracy of our M/L estimates using synthetic spectra. Here, we explore sources of systematic error in our mass measurements by comparing our new measurements to data from the literature. We compare our stellar mass surface density estimates to kinematics-derived dynamical mass surface density measurements from the DiskMass Survey and find some tension between the two which could be resolved if the disk scale-heights used in the kinematic analysis were overestimated by a factor of equation. We formulate an aperture-corrected stellar mass catalog for the MaNGA survey, and compare to previous stellar mass estimates based on multi-band optical photometry, finding typical discrepancies of 0.1 dex. Using the spatially resolved MaNGA data, we evaluate the impact of estimating total stellar masses from spatially unresolved spectra, and we explore how the biases that result from unresolved spectra depend upon the galaxy's dust extinction and star formation rate. Finally, we describe a SDSS Value-Added Catalog which will include both spatially resolved and total (aperture-corrected) stellar masses for MaNGA galaxies.",2019,[],5
1911.08471,astro-ph,"We present and test a framework that models the three-dimensional distribution of mass in the Universe as a function of cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Our approach combines two different techniques: a rescaling algorithm that modifies the cosmology of gravity-only N-body simulations, and a baryonification algorithm which mimics the effects of astrophysical processes induced by baryons, such as star formation and AGN feedback. We show how this approach can accurately reproduce the effects of baryons on the matter power spectrum of various state-of-the-art hydro-dynamical simulations (EAGLE, Illustris, Illustris-TNG, Horizon-AGN, and OWLS,Cosmo-OWLS and BAHAMAS), to percent level from very large down to small, highly nonlinear scales, k= 5 h/Mpc, and from z=0 up to z=2. We highlight that, thanks to the heavy optimisation of the algorithms, we can obtain these predictions for arbitrary baryonic models and cosmology (including massive neutrinos and dynamical dark energy models) with an almost negligible CPU cost. Therefore, this approach is efficient enough for cosmological data analyses. With these tools in hand we explore the degeneracies between cosmological and astrophysical parameters in the nonlinear mass power spectrum. Our findings suggest that after marginalising over baryonic physics, cosmological constraints inferred from weak gravitational lensing should be moderately degraded.",2019,[],5
1903.11603,astro-ph,"Thermal emission spectra of hot Jupiters have led to key constraints on thermal inversions (or 'stratospheres') in their atmospheres with important implications for their atmospheric processes. Canonically, thermal inversions in hot Jupiters have been suggested to be caused by species such as TiO and VO which have strong visible opacity to absorb incident starlight. We explore two new avenues for thermal inversions in hot Jupiters, exploring both the visible and infrared opacities in their atmospheres. Firstly, by exploring a range of metal-rich species we find that four species (AlO, CaO, NaH and MgH) provide visible opacities comparable to TiO/VO and can cause strong inversions with reasonable abundances. Secondly, we show that a low infrared opacity caused by a low HequationO abundance, e.g. through a C/O~1, can also lead to strong thermal inversions even with low abundances of the visible absorbers mentioned above. We find that increasing the C/O ratio towards unity requires almost 2 orders of magnitude lower abundances for the visible absorbers in order for an inversion to form. Finally, we explore the thermal inversion in WASP-121b and find that it can be explained by all the visible absorbers listed above for different C/O ratios. Our study demonstrates the importance of both the refractory and volatile species in governing the physicochemical processes in hot Jupiter atmospheres. Spectroscopic observations in the visible have the potential to detect the newly proposed refractory species that can cause thermal inversions in addition to TiO and VO.",2019,[],5

1909.12961,astro-ph,"GW170817 began gravitational-wave multimessenger astronomy. However, GW170817 will not be representative of detections in the coming years -- typical gravitational-wave sources will be closer the detection horizon, have larger localization regions, and (when present) will have correspondingly weaker electromagnetic emission. In its design state, the gravitational-wave detector network in the mid-2020s will consist of up to five similar-sensitivity second-generation interferometers. The instantaneous sky-coverage by the full network is nearly isotropic, in contrast to the configuration during the first \changethree observing runs. Along with the coverage of the sky, there are also commensurate increases in the average horizon for a given binary mass. We present a realistic set of localizations for binary neutron stars and neutron star--black hole binaries, incorporating intra-network duty cycles and selection effects on the astrophysical distributions. Based on the assumption of an equation duty cycle, and that two instruments observe a signal above the detection threshold, we anticipate a median of equation sq.\ deg.\ for binary neutron stars, and equation--equation sq.\ deg.\ for neutron star--black hole (depending on the population assumed). These distributions have a wide spread, and the best localizations, even for networks with fewer instruments, will have localizations of equation--equation sq.\ deg.\ range. The full five instrument network reduces localization regions to a few tens of degrees at worst.",2019,[],5
1911.10212,astro-ph,"The prevalence of outflow and feedback signatures in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is a major unresolved question which large integral field unit (IFU) surveys now allow to address. In this paper, we present a kinematic analysis of the ionised gas in 2778 galaxies at z equation 0.05 observed by SDSS-IV MaNGA. Specifically, we measure the kinematics of the [OIII] letter5007\AA emission line in each spatial element and fit multiple Gaussian components to account for possible non-gravitational motions of gas. Comparing the kinematics of the ionised gas between 308 MaNGA-selected AGN that have been previously identified through emission line diagnostics and sources not classified as AGN, we find that while 25% of MaNGA-selected AGN show [OIII] components with emission line widths of equation 500 km/s in more than 10% of their spaxels, only 7% of MaNGA non-AGN show a similar signature. Even the AGN that do not show nuclear AGN photoionisation signatures and that were only identified as AGN based on their larger scale photoionisation signatures show similar kinematic characteristics. In addition to obscuration, another possibility is that outflow and mechanical feedback signatures are longer lived than the AGN itself. Our measurements demonstrate that high velocity gas is more prevalent in AGN compared to non-AGN and that outflow and feedback signatures in low-luminosity, low-redshift AGN may so far have been underestimated. We show that higher luminosity MaNGA-selected AGN are able to drive larger scale outflows than lower luminosity AGN. But estimates of the kinetic coupling efficiencies are equation 1% and suggest that the feedback signatures probed in this paper are unlikely to have a significant impact on the AGN host galaxies. However, continuous energy injection may still heat a fraction of the cool gas and delay or suppress star formation in individual galaxies even when the AGN is weak.",2019,[],5

First, I briefly summarise the global spectroscopic properties of these galaxies, discussing the main ionization processes, and the global relations described between the star-formation rates, oxygen abundances, and average properties of their stellar populations (age and metallicity) with the stellar mass. Second, I present the local distribution of the ionizing processes, down to kiloparsec scales, and I show how the global scaling relations found between integrated parameters (like the star-formation main sequence, mass-metallicity relation and Schmidt-Kennicutt law) present local/resolved counter-parts, with the global ones being just integrated/average versions of the local ones. I discuss the local/resolved star-formation and chemical enrichment histories and their implication on the inside-out growth of galaxies. Third, I present the radial distributions of the surface densities of the properties explored globally, and how they depend on the integrated galaxy properties.

1903.12111,astro-ph,"Coupled models of mantle thermal evolution, volcanism, outgassing, weathering, and climate evolution for Earth-like (in terms of size and composition) stagnant lid planets are used to assess their prospects for habitability. The results indicate that planetary COequation budgets ranging from equation orders of magnitude lower than Earth's to equation order of magnitude larger, and radiogenic heating budgets as large or larger than Earth's, allow for habitable climates lasting 1-5 Gyrs. The ability of stagnant lid planets to recover from potential snowball states is also explored; recovery is found to depend on whether atmosphere-ocean chemical exchange is possible. For a ""hard"" snowball with no exchange, recovery is unlikely, as most COequation outgassing takes place via metamorphic decarbonation of the crust, which occurs below the ice layer. However, for a ""soft"" snowball where there is exchange between atmosphere and ocean, planets can readily recover. For both hard and soft snowball states, there is a minimum COequation budget needed for recovery; below this limit any snowball state would be permanent. Thus there is the possibility for hysteresis in stagnant lid planet climate evolution, where planets with low COequation budgets that start off in a snowball climate will be permanently stuck in this state, while otherwise identical planets that start with a temperate climate will be capable of maintaining this climate for 1 Gyrs or more. Finally, the model results have important implications for future exoplanet missions, as they can guide observations to planets most likely to possess habitable climates.",2019,[],5

We then further lower systematics by excising observations contaminated by ultra-faint RFI, reducing by an additional factor of 3.8 in power for the zenith pointing.

1905.06066,astro-ph,"Microlensing of stars, e.g. in the Galactic bulge and Andromeda galaxy (M31), is among the most robust, powerful method to constrain primordial black holes (PBHs) that are a viable candidate of dark matter. If PBHs are in the mass range equation\; \buildrel < \over \sim \;equation, its Schwarzschild radius (equation) becomes comparable with or shorter than optical wavelength (equation used in a microlensing search, and in this regime the wave optics effect on microlensing needs to be taken into account. For a lensing PBH with mass satisfying equation, it causes a characteristic oscillatory feature in the microlensing light curve, and it will give a smoking gun evidence of PBH if detected, because any astrophysical object cannot have such a tiny Schwarzschild radius. Even in a statistical study, e.g. constraining the abundance of PBHs from a systematic search of microlensing events for a sample of many source stars, the wave effect needs to be taken into account. We examine the impact of wave effect on the PBH constraints obtained from the equation-band (6210\AA) monitoring observation of M31 stars in Niikura et al. (2019), and find that a finite source size effect is dominant over the wave effect for PBHs in the mass range equation. We also discuss that, if a denser-cadence (10~sec), equation-band monitoring observation for a sample of white dwarfs over a year timescale is available, it would allow one to explore the wave optics effect on microlensing light curve, if it occurs, or improve the PBH constraints in equation\; \buildrel < \over \sim \;equation even from a null detection.",2019,[],5

We report a stacking analysis to search for neutrino emission from 35 PWNe that are very-high-energy gamma-ray emitters and the results using 9.5 years of all-sky IceCube data.

1907.08668,astro-ph,"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will observe several stars for long cumulative durations while pursuing exoplanets as primary science targets for both Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) and very likely General Observer (GO) programs. Here we argue in favor of an automatic default parallels program to observe e.g., using the F200W/F277W filters or grism of NIRCAM/NIRISS in order to find high redshift (z >> 10) galaxies, cool red/brown dwarf-sub-stellar objects, Solar System objects, and observations of serendipitous planetary transits. We argue here the need for automated exploratory astrophysical observations with unused JWST instruments during these long duration exoplanet observations. Randomized fields that are observed in parallel mode reduce errors due to cosmic variance more effectively than single continuous fields of a typical wedding cake observing strategy (Trenti & Stiavelli 2008). Hence, we argue that the proposed automated survey will explore a unique and rich discovery space in high redshift Universe, Galactic structure, and Solar System. We show that the GTO and highly-probable GO target list of exoplanets covers the Galactic disk/halo and high redshift Universe, mostly well out of the plane of the disk of the Milky Way. Exposure times are of the order of the CEERS GTO medium deep survey in a single filter, comparable to CANDELS in HST's surveys and deep fields.

1909.06093,astro-ph,"The connection between the dipolar modulation asymmetry and the quadrupole-octopole alignment in the CMB is studied in this work. First, a generalization of the dipolar modulation model is proposed by considering that the amplitude may depend on the scale. As derived from a Bayesian inference analysis, this model fits the CMB data better than the scale-independent one. As an extension of the standard model, the scale-dependent dipolar modulation shows comparable evidence to the standard isotropic model in the large scales (equation). The posterior distribution of the parameters of the scale-dependent model suggests that the amplitude of the dipolar modulation is large at the lowest multipoles. This large asymmetry induces a detectable correlation between the quadrupole and the octopole. The significance of the quadrupole-octopole alignment is analyzed under the assumption that the Universe has a scale-dependent dipolar modulation. The three alignment estimators considered in this paper show an increment of equation in the p-value, showing a clear correlation between these two CMB anomalies. Within this new scenario, only one of the alignment estimators is still below the equation probability level.",2019,[],5
1912.00441,astro-ph,"[DBS2003]179 is a super star cluster in the Galaxy discovered by deep near infrared observations. We carried out CO J=1-0 and J=3-2 observations of the region of [DBS2003]179 with NANTEN2, ASTE and the Mopra 22m telescope. We identified and mapped two molecular clouds which are likely associated with the cluster. The association is evidenced by the spatial correlation with the 8 micron Spitzer image, and a high ratio of the two transitions of 12CO (J=3-2 to J=1-0). The two clouds show complementary distribution in space and bridge features connecting them in velocity. We frame a hypothesis that the two clouds collided with each other 1-2 Myr ago, and the collision compressed the interface layer, triggering the formation of the cluster. This offers an additional piece of evidence for a super star cluster formed by cloud--cloud collision alongside of the four super star clusters including Wd2, NGC3603, RCW38 and R136. The findings indicate that the known super star clusters having closely associated dust emission are formed by cloud-cloud collision, lending support for the important role of cloud--cloud collision in high-mass star formation.",2019,[],5
1906.12168,astro-ph,"Cumulative optical and infrared emission from galaxies accumulated over cosmological time scales, the extragalactic background light (EBL), could be probed by complementary techniques of direct observations and source counting in the visible and infrared as well as via its imprint on the signal of distant active galactic nuclei in gamma rays. We compare the visible and infrared measurements with the gamma-ray constraints and study if the discrepancies of the measurements with different methods could be due to the presence of features in the EBL spectrum that are localised in the micron wavelength range. We combined data on time-averaged spectra of selected blazars that were obtained by Fermi and ground-based gamma-ray telescopes. We also modelled the effect of absorption on EBL while allowing for the existence of a previously unaccounted spectral feature. We show that a previously reported 'excess' in EBL flux in the equation~micron wavelength range is consistent with gamma-ray measurements, that is, if the excess has the form of a narrow feature of the width equation and an overall flux of up to 15 nW/(mequation sr) above the 'minimal' EBL, which is estimated from the visible and infrared source counts. Such 'bump-like' spectral features could originate, for example, from decaying dark-matter particles, or either axions or peculiar astrophysical processes in the course of star-formation history.

The introduction of the cold gas kinematics shows a significant effect on the confidence limits of especially the dark halo properties: we exclude more than equation of models within the equation confidence level of Schwarzschild modelling with only stellar kinematics, and reduce the relative uncertainty of the dark matter fraction significantly to equation within equation.

A similar high-energy cutoff was likewise reported in GRB 160509A and GRB 100724B earlier, as well as handful of other sources. The cutoff can be explained by the intrinsic opacity due to pair production within the emitting region.

1911.02757,astro-ph,"We study the two-temperature magnetized advective accretion flow around the Kerr black holes. During accretion, ions are heated up due to viscous dissipation, and when Coulomb coupling becomes effective, they transfer a part of their energy to the electrons. On the contrary, electrons lose energy due to various radiative cooling processes, namely bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and Comtonization processes, respectively. To account for the magnetic contribution inside the disc, we consider the toroidal magnetic fields which are assumed to be dominant over other components. Moreover, we adopt the relativistic equation of state to describe the thermal characteristics of the flow. With this, we calculate the global transonic accretion solutions around the rotating black holes. We find that accretion solution containing multiple critical points may harbor shock wave provided the standing shock conditions are satisfied. Further, we investigate the shock properties, such as shock location (equation) and compression ratio (equation) that delineate the post-shock corona (hereafter PSC) and find that the dynamics of PSC is controlled by the flow parameters, such as accretion rate (equation) and magnetic fields (equation, defined as the ratio of gas pressure to the magnetic pressure), etc. Finally, we calculate the emission spectra of the accretion flows containing PSC and indicate that both equation and equation play the pivotal roles in explaining the spectral state transitions commonly observed for black hole X-ray binaries.",2019,[],5

1904.04301,astro-ph,"We present a study of the extinction and depletion-derived dust properties of gamma-ray burst (GRB) absorbers at equation showing the presence of neutral carbon (\ionCI).

In addition to the already well-established correlation between the amount of \ionCI and visual extinction, equation, we also observe a correlation with the total-to-selective reddening, equation. All three quantities are also found to be connected to the presence and strength of the 2175\,\AA dust extinction feature. While the amount of \ionCI is found to be correlated with the SED-derived dust properties, we do not find any evidence for a connection with the depletion-derived dust content as measured from [Zn/Fe] and equation(Fe)equation. To reconcile this, we discuss a scenario where the observed extinction is dominated by the composition of dust particles confined in the molecular gas-phase of the ISM. We argue that since the depletion level trace non-carbonaceous dust in the ISM, the observed extinction in GRB \ionCI absorbers is primarily produced by carbon-rich dust in the molecular cloud and is therefore only observable in the extinction curves and not in the depletion patterns. This also indicates that the 2175\,\AA dust extinction feature is caused by dust and molecules in the cold and molecular gas-phase.

1908.05175,astro-ph,"Context: Distant trans-Neptunian objects are subject to planetary perturbations and galactic tides. The former decrease with the distance, while the latter increase. In the intermediate regime where they have the same order of magnitude (the 'inert Oort cloud'), both are weak, resulting in very long evolution timescales. To date, three observed objects can be considered to belong to this category.   Aims: We aim to provide a clear understanding of where this transition occurs, and to characterise the long-term dynamics of small bodies in the intermediate regime: relevant resonances, chaotic zones (if any), and timescales at play.   Results: There exists a tilted equilibrium plane (Laplace plane) about which orbits precess. The dynamics is integrable in the low and high semi-major axis regimes, but mostly chaotic in between. From 800 to 1100 au, the chaos covers almost all the eccentricity range. The diffusion timescales are large, but not to the point of being indiscernible in a 4.5 Gyrs duration: the perihelion distance can actually vary from tens to hundreds of au. Orbital variations are favoured in specific ranges of inclination corresponding to well-defined resonances. Starting from uniform distributions, the orbital angles cluster after 4.5 Gyrs for semi-major axes larger than 500 au, because of a very slow differential precession.   Conclusions: Even if it is characterised by very long timescales, the inert Oort cloud is much less inert than it appears. Orbits can be considered inert over 4.5 Gyrs only in small portions of the space of orbital elements, which include (90377) Sedna and 2012VP113. Effects of the galactic tides are discernible down to semi-major axes of about 500 au.

We find that the value of R31 between 2 - 9 kpc galactocentric radius is 0.14, significantly lower than what is seen in the nuclear ring at ~1 kpc (R31 ~ 0.8), only to rise again to 0.27 for the fields centred on the 10 kpc star forming ring. We also found that R31 is positively correlated with dust temperature, with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient equation = 0.55. The correlation between star formation rate surface density and CO(3--2) intensity is much stronger than with CO(1-0), with equation = 0.54 compared to -0.05, suggesting that the CO(3-2) line traces warmer and denser star forming gas better.

1901.09905,gr-qc,"We consider configurations consisting of a gravitating nonlinear spinor field equation, with a nonlinearity of the type equation, minimally coupled to Maxwell and Proca fields through the coupling constants equation [U(1) electric charge] and equation, respectively. In order to ensure spherical symmetry of the configurations, we use two spin-equation fields having opposite spins. By means of numerical computations, we find families of equilibrium configurations with a positive Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass described by regular zero-node asymptotically flat solutions for static Maxwell and Proca fields and for stationary spinor fields. For the case of the Maxwell field, it is shown that, with increasing charge equation, the masses of the objects increase and diverge as the charge tends to a critical value. For negative values of the coupling constant equation, we demonstrate that, by choosing physically reasonable values of this constant, it is possible to obtain configurations with masses comparable to the Chandrasekhar mass and with effective radii of the order of kilometers. It enables us to speak of an astrophysical interpretation of such systems, regarding them as charged Dirac stars. In turn, for the system with the Proca field, it is shown that the mass of the configurations also grows with increasing both equation and the coupling constant equation. Although in this case the numerical calculations do not allow us to make a definite conclusion about the possibility of obtaining masses comparable to the Chandrasekhar mass for physically reasonable values of equation, one may expect that such masses can be obtained for certain values of free parameters of the system under consideration.",2019,[],4

The global phase structures, especially the phase transition temperature equation and the Gibbs free energy equation, are systematically investigated, first for the Schwarzschild-AdS black holes and then for the charged and rotating AdS black holes in the grand canonical ensembles, with both analytical and numerical methods.

The nonzero charge of the black hole shows stronger repulsive effects to prevent light rays from falling into the black hole as compared with the Kerr case. As a result, the radius of the innermost circular motion of light rays with the critical impact parameter decreases as charge equation of the black hole increases for both direct and retrograde motions.

1910.02687,gr-qc,"We present a unified causal general relativistic formulation of dissipative and non-dissipative continuum mechanics. The presented theory is the first general relativistic theory that can deal simultaneously with viscous fluids as well as irreversible deformations in solids and hence it also provides a fully covariant formulation of the Newtonian continuum mechanics in arbitrary curvilinear spacetimes. In such a formulation, the matter is considered as a Riemann-Cartan manifold with non-vanishing torsion and the main field of the theory being the non-holonomic basis tetrad field also called four-distortion field. Thanks to the variational nature of the governing equations, the theory is compatible with the variational structure of the Einstein field equations. Symmetric hyperbolic equations are the only admissible equations in our unified theory and thus, all perturbations propagate at finite speeds (even in the diffusive regime) and the Cauchy problem for the governing PDEs is locally well-posed for arbitrary and regular initial data which is very important for the numerical treatment of the presented model. Nevertheless, the numerical solution of the discussed hyperbolic equations is a challenging task because of the presence of the stiff algebraic source terms of relaxation type and non-conservative differential terms. Our numerical strategy is thus based on an advanced family of high-accuracy ADER Discontinuous Galerkin and Finite Volume methods which provides a very efficient framework for general relaxation hyperbolic PDE systems. An extensive range of numerical examples is presented demonstrating the applicability of our theory to relativistic flows of viscous fluids and deformation of solids in Minkowski and curved spacetimes.",2019,[],4

The temperature and mass of the black hole monotonically decrease from its Schwarzschild value to zero when the coupling constant is increased up to its extremal value. Nevertheless, for small and moderate values of the coupling constant the Hawking radiation is enhanced, and only in the regime of large coupling it is suppressed, as one could expect. The reason for such counter-intuitive behavior is the important role of the grey-body factors: for small and moderate couplings the temperature falls relatively slowly, while the effective potentials for black holes of the same mass become considerably lower, allowing for much higher transmission rates. We have also estimated the lifetime of such black holes and shown that the range of black-hole masses at which ultra-relativistic emission of massive electrons and positrons starts is shifted towards smaller black-hole masses when the coupling constant is large.",2019,[],4
1905.00718,gr-qc,"In this paper, we investigate the effects of Type IV singularity through equation gravity description of inflationary universe, where equation denotes the torsion scalar. With the Friedmann equations of the theory, we reconstruct a equation model according to a given Hubble rate susceptible to describe the inflationary era near the type IV singularity. Moreover, we calculate the Hubble flow parameters in order to determine the dynamical evolution of the cosmological system. The results show that some of the Hubble flow parameters are small near the Type IV singularity and become singular at Type IV Singularity, indicating that a dynamical instability of the cosmological system occurs a that point. This means that the dynamical cosmological evolution up to that point, ceases to be the final attractor since the system is abruptly interrupted. Furthermore, by considering the equation trace anomaly equation and the slow-roll conditions, we deal with the de Sitter inflationary description of the reconstructed model. As results, the model leads to a conditional instability, view as the source of the graceful exit from inflation. Our theoretical equation description based on slow-roll parameters not only confirms some observational data on spectral index and the scalar-to-tensor ratio from Planck data and BICEPequation/Keck-Array data, but also shows the property of equation gravity in describing the early and late-time evolution of our universe.",2019,[],4

Therefore our analysis is not affected by the tension of the current estimates of the Hubble parameter, and does not rely on any model-dependent assumption of the entropy amount at the present epoch.

1902.08441,gr-qc,"In inhomogeneous cosmology, restricting attention to an irrotational dust matter model, backreaction arises in terms of the deviation of the averaged spatial scalar curvature from a constant-curvature model on some averaging domain equation, equation, and the kinematical backreaction equation. These backreaction variables can be modeled as an effective scalar field, called the `morphon field'. The general cosmological equations still need a closure condition to be solved. A simple example is the class of scaling solutions where equation and equation are assumed to follow a power law of the volume scale factor equation. But while they can describe models of quintessence, these and other models still assume the existence of dark matter in addition to the known sources. Going beyond scaling solutions by using a model for structure formation that we argue is reasonably generic, we investigate the correspondence between the morphon field and fundamental scalar field dark matter models, in order to describe dark matter as an effective phenomenon arising from kinematical backreaction and the averaged spatial curvature of the inhomogeneous Universe. While we find significant differences with those fundamental models, our main result is that the energy budget on typical collapsing domains is provided by curvature and matter in equal parts already around the turn-around time, leading to curvature dominance thereafter and increasing to a curvature contribution of equation of the energy budget at the onset of virialization. Kinematical backreaction is subdominant at early stages, but its importance rises quickly after turn-around and dominates the curvature contribution in the final phase of the collapse. We conclude that backreaction can indeed mimic dark matter (in the energy budget) during the collapse phase of megaparsec-scale structures.",2019,[],4

Unsurprisingly, the theoretical predictions are very sensitive to the quantum effects that occur close to the classical big bang singularity. It is therefore of substantial interest to describe these effects as precisely as possible. This is the first in a series of papers that aim at improving on the treatment of quantum effects that arise due to backreactions between matter and geometry. The technique we employ is space adiabatic perturbation theory (SAPT) in the form developed in seminal papers by Panati, Spohn and Teufel. SAPT is a generalisation of the more familiar Born Oppenheimer Approximation (BOA) that applies well in systems that allow a split of the degrees of freedom into two sets that propagate on rather different time scales such as the homogeneous and inhomogeneous field modes in cosmology. We will show that this leads to presently neglected correction terms in the quantum Friedman equations.   In the present paper we adapt and generalise SAPT to the hybrid approach to quantum cosmology developed by Mena Marugan et al. that allows for a systematic quantum separation of the (in)homogeneous modes.

1904.00153,gr-qc,"Dynamics in conformally connected frames are often referred to as 'equivalent'. In the context of cosmology, while the perturbations remain invariant for a single scalar field model, the background equations differ and therefore the dynamics. However, since the background dynamics are not the same, it is not clear whether the attractor nature of the solutions remains the same in all conformally connected frames, i.e., a stable solution in one frame implies an equivalent stable solution in another frame. To answer the question, in this work, we first consider power law cosmology in the Brans-Dicke theory as well as in the conformal Einstein frame. We show that, in this case, the attractor behavior is indeed equivalent under conformal transformation, i.e., an attractor solution in one frame implies an attractor solution in another frame. However, the decay rates of the deviations from the fixed points are different in the two frames. We are able to relate the behavior and find that the difference is due to the difference in e-fold 'clocks' in different frames, i.e., equation in different frames differ from one another. We show that the behavior is indeed true for any model in conformally connected frames and obtain the general 'equivalence' relation. In the context of inflation, we consider two models: Starobinsky and chaotic inflation, and explicitly point out the differences in these two frames.

Then the consequent domain wall motion outside the black hole generally falls into four situations: all time accelerating expansion, slow expansion with a constant speed, expansion followed by collapsing into horizon, and accelerating collapsing into horizon. However, there exists a small patch of parametric sphere, in which the domain wall expansion first slows down and then accelerates. Our analysis also reveals that the big bang theory applies to the domain wall world scenario, while big bounce will not appear in our paper.

1905.08484,gr-qc,"We follow the life of a generic primordial perturbation mode (scalar or tensor) subject to modified dispersion relations (MDR), as its proper wavelength is stretched by expansion.

We find that scalar modes in the observable range satisfy this condition, thus ensuring the viability of MDR models in this respect. For tensor modes we find a regime in which this does not occur, but in practice it can only be realised for wavelengths in the range probed by future gravity wave experiments if the quantum gravity scale experienced by gravity waves goes down to the PeV range.

The discretized metrics obtained exhibit a spontaneous polarization in regions of positive and negative scalar curvature. We compare this ensemble with a class of continuous metrics previously found, which satisfy the condition equation exactly, or in certain cases even the stronger condition equation for any equation.

1911.11723,gr-qc,"Based on an investigation into the near-horizon geometrical description of black hole spacetimes (the so-called ""(equation,equation) sector""), we find that the surface area of the event horizon of a black hole is mirrored in the area of a newly-defined surface, which naturally emerges from studying the intrinsic curvature of the (equation,equation) sector at the horizon. We define this new, abstract surface for a range of different black holes and show that, in each case, the surface encodes event horizon information, despite its derivation relying purely on the (equation,equation) sector of the metrical description. This is a very surprising finding as this sector is orthogonal to the sector explicitly describing the horizon geometry. Our results provide new evidence supporting the conjecture that black holes are, in some sense, fundamentally two-dimensional. As black hole entropy is known to be proportional to horizon area, a novel two-dimensional interpretation of this entropy may also be possible.",2019,[],4

1901.00938,gr-qc,"Binary pulsars provide some of the tightest current constraints on modified theories of gravity and these constraints will only get tighter as radio astronomers continue timing these systems. These binary pulsars are particularly good at constraining scalar-tensor theories in which gravity is mediated by a scalar field in addition to the metric tensor. Scalar-tensor theories can predict large deviations from General Relativity due to the fact that they allow for violation of the strong-equivalence principle through a phenomenon known as scalarization. This effect appears directly in the timing model for binary pulsars, and as such, it can be tightly constrained through precise timing. In this paper, we investigate these constraints for two scalar-tensor theories and a large set of realistic equations of state. We calculate the constraints that can be placed by saturating the current equation bounds on single post-Keplerian parameters, as well as employing Bayesian methods through Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo simulations to explore the constraints that can be achieved when one considers all measured parameters simultaneously. Our results demonstrate that both methods are able to place similar constraints and that they are both indeed dominated by the measurements of the orbital period decay.

For scalar-metric systems, a conformal class of Ashtekar-Barbero connection variables is constructed, which can be quantized using spin networks. Crucially, the quantum states become separable into the eigen states of the generator of the scale transformation and spin-network states in the Einstein frame. The eigen values consist of additional quantum numbers including a new type of fundamental frequency equation and energy equation with respect to a new local time equation carried by every spin-network vertex. The discretely distributed equation values as the ""quanta of time"" correspond to a functional time related to the integrated Weyl current in the classical theory. The Immirzi ambiguity of loop quantum geometry is removed by scale symmetry. To probe the quantum behaviour of the early Universe, the new formalism is applied to a scale-invariant homogenous and isotropic cosmological model coupled to a doublet of scalars with illustrative numerical simulations. The Einstein-frame volume is quantized in recently improved and regularized polymer representations with an arbitrary Immirzi parameter. The resulting unitary evolution of the quantum state of an expanding universe has a positive energy spectrum. A rescaling of the Immirzi parameter is equivalent to a translation in time without changing dynamics.

For DF2, the dynamical mass is almost equal to the luminous mass suggesting the galaxy have little to no `dark matter' in equationCDM whereas DF4 requires a dynamical mass-to-light ratio of equation making it to be almost entirely consists of dark matter. It has been claimed that both these galaxies, marking the extreme points in terms of the estimated dynamical mass-to-light ratio among known galaxies, would be difficult to explain in modified gravity scenarios. Extending the analysis presented in \citeislam2019modified, we explore the dynamics of DF2 and DF44 within the context of three popular alternative theories of gravity [Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), Weyl Conformal gravity and Modified gravity (MOG)] and examine their viability against the dispersion data of DF2 and DF44.

We argue that the cancelation of this anomaly makes it impossible to preserve dS symmetry in linearized quantum gravity through the usual canonical quantization in a consistent manner. Then, demanding that all the classical symmetries to survive in the quantized theory, we set up a coordinate-independent formalism \`a \emphla Gupta-Bleuler which allows for preserving the (manifest) dS covariance in the presence of the gauge and the gauge-like invariance of the theory.

We argue that these two formulations of gravity are related to two different discretizations of the Einstein--Cartan action, which were studied recently in the literature. The first discretization leads to the \emphloop gravity kinematical phase space where the zero torsion condition is enforced first and the other is the \emphdual loop gravity kinematical phase space where curvature is imposed to vanish first. Our argument is based on the observation that the GR first-order Einstein--Cartan action can also be seen as a first-order action for teleparallel gravity up to a boundary term.

1912.13348,gr-qc,"In this work we consider a cosmological model in which dark energy is portrayed by a canonical scalar field which is allowed to couple to the other species by means of a disformal transformation of the metric. We revisit the current literature by assuming that the disformal function in the metric transformation can depend both on the scalar field itself and on its derivatives, encapsulating a wide variety of scalar-tensor theories. This generalisation also leads to new and richer phenomenology, explaining some of the features found in previously studied models. We present the background equations and perform a detailed dynamical analysis, from where new disformal fixed points emerge, that translate into novel cosmological features. These include early scaling regimes between the coupled species and broader stability parameter regions. However, viable cosmological models seem to have suppressed disformal late-time contributions.",2019,[],4

For the odd order of Legendre polynomial, the center of shadow oscillates up and down with time along the direction which is vertical to equatorial plane. For even l, the center of shadow does not move, but it alternately stretches and squeezes with time along the vertical direction. Moreover, the presence of the gravitational wave leads to that the self-similar fractal structures appear in the boundary of the black hole shadow. We found that this special gravitational wave has a greater impact on the vertical direction of black hole shadow. Our results show that the presence of gravitational wave yields some interesting properties of black hole shadow.",2019,[],4

The derivation can be used as a pedagogical tool, similar to the way that simplified derivations of the gravitational deflection of light are used in teaching about general relativity without making use of the more advanced mathematical concepts.

Understanding the dynamics of this spacetime is important for testing theories of gravity and probing a regime which has not yet been studied with observations. In this paper, we construct an analytical solution for the exterior spacetime of a neutron star in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity that is independent of the equation of state chosen. The aim is to provide a metric that can be used to probe the strong-field regime near a neutron star and create predictions that can be compared with future observations to place possible constraints on the theory. In addition to constructing the metric, we examine a number of physical systems in order to see what deviations exist between our spacetime and that of general relativity.

For universal reasons related to the uncertainty principle, quantum corrections then depend on the size of the averaging volume. In minisuperspace truncations, the value of this volume remains an arbitrary parameter devoid of physical meaning, but in an effective field theory it is identified with the infrared scale of inhomogeneous modes. Moreover, the infrared scale is running during gravitational collapse, when regions in which homogeneity remains approximately valid shrink to increasingly smaller co-moving sizes. Conceptual implications of this infrared renormalization for perturbative inhomogeneity in quantum cosmology are presented here, mainly for the example of loop quantum cosmology.

1904.10920,gr-qc,"Initial conditions given on a spacelike, static slice of a non-globally hyperbolic spacetime may not define the fates of classical and quantum fields uniquely. Such lack of global hyperbolicity is a well-known property of the anti-de Sitter solution and led many authors to question how is it possible to develop a quantum field theory on this spacetime. Wald and Ishibashi took a step towards the healing of that causal issue when considering the propagation of scalar fields on AdS. They proposed a systematic procedure to obtain a physically consistent dynamical evolution. Their prescription relies on determining the self-adjoint extensions of the spatial component of the differential wave operator. Such a requirement leads to the imposition of a specific set of boundary conditions at infinity. We employ their scheme in the particular case of the four-dimensional AdS spacetime and compute the expectation values of the field squared and the energy-momentum tensor, which will then bear the effects of those boundary conditions. We are not aware of any laws of nature constraining us to prescribe the same boundary conditions to all modes of the wave equation. Thus, we formulate a physical setup in which one of those modes satisfy a Robin boundary condition, while all others satisfy the Dirichlet condition. Due to our unusual settings, the resulting contributions to the fluctuations of the expectation values will not respect AdS invariance. As a consequence, a back-reaction procedure would yield a non-maximally symmetric spacetime. Furthermore, we verify the violation of weak energy condition as a direct consequence of our prescription for dynamics.",2019,[],4

These two flux components seem to dominate the effect of backreaction in the IH vicinity; and furthermore, their regularization procedure reveals remarkable simplicity. We consider the Hartle-Hawking and Unruh quantum states, the latter corresponding to an evaporating black hole. In both quantum states, we compute equation and equation in the IH vicinity for a wide range of equation values. We find that both equation and equation attain finite asymptotic values at the IH. Depending on equation, these asymptotic values are found to be either positive or negative (or vanishing in-between).

On the basis of this result, we study the relation between the latent heat of the phase transition and the parameter of dark energy, and use the Landau continuous phase transition theory to discuss the critical phenomenon of the black hole with quintessence and give the critical exponent. By introducing the number density of the black hole molecules, some properties of the microstructure of black holes are studied in terms of a phase transition. It is found that the electric charge of the black hole and the normalization parameter related to the density of quintessence field play a key role in phase transition.

Nevertheless it is known to fail for evolving near-critical Brill wave data. We construct a new `quasi-maximal' slicing condition and demonstrate that it exhibits better behavior for such data. This condition is based on the 1log slicing with an additional source term derived from maximal slicing.

Dragging effects present in such spacetimes lead either to rotation of rings or asymmetry of both streams. We demonstrate that the model of rotating rings is general enough to describe all axisymmetric stationary disk sources with vanishing radial pressure which satisfy weak energy condition, and that centrifugal effects present in the disk sources of spacetimes with large angular momentum prevent the construction of highly compact sources made of counter-rotating streams of geodesic particles.

This stands as sufficient reason to render new resultant Principles of Dynamics - `TRiPoD' - a significant and worthwhile development of the Principles of Dynamics.

1911.00440,gr-qc,"In light of the current (and future) gravitational wave detections, more sensitive tests of general relativity can be devised. Black hole spectroscopy has long been proposed as a way to test the no-hair theorem, that is, how closely an astrophysical black hole can be described by the Kerr geometry. We use simulations from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes project to assess the detectability of one extra quasinormal mode in the ringdown of a binary black hole coalescence, with numbers equation distinct from the fundamental quadrupolar mode (2,2,0). Our approach uses the complex waveform as well as the time derivative of the phase in two prescriptions that allow us to estimate the point at which the ringdown is best described by a single mode or by a sum of two modes. By scaling all amplitudes to equation, our results for non-spinning binaries indicate that for mass ratios of 1:1 to 5:1 the first overtone (2,2,1) will always have a larger excitation amplitude than the fundamental modes of other harmonics, making it a more promising candidate for detection. Even though the (2,2,1) mode damps about three times faster than the higher harmonics and its frequency is very close to that of the (2,2,0) mode, its larger excitation amplitude still guarantees a more favorable scenario for detection. In particular, for equal-mass binaries the ratio of the amplitude of the first overtone (2,2,1) to the fundamental mode (2,2,0) will be equation, whereas the corresponding ratio for the higher harmonics will be equation. For binaries with mass ratios larger than 5:1 we find that the modes (2,2,1), (2,1,0) and (3,3,0) should have comparable amplitude ratios in the range 0.3 - 0.4. The expectation that the (2,2,1) mode should be more easily detectable than the (3,3,0) mode is confirmed with an extension of the mode resolvability analysis for larger mass ratios.",2019,[],4

A singularity-free cyclic universe with negative varying cosmological constant has been obtained which supports the role suggested for negative equation in stopping the eternal acceleration. The cosmological solutions have been obtained for the case of a flat universe, supported by observations. The cosmic pressure grows without singular values, it is positive during the early-time decelerated expansion and negative during the late-time accelerating epoch. The time varying EoS parameter equation shows a quintom behavior and is restricted to the range equation. The validity of the classical linear energy conditions and the sound speed causality condition has been studied. The non-conventional mechanism of negative cosmological constant that are expected to address the late-time acceleration has been discussed.",2019,[],4

In this paper, we propose to use the shadow of supermassive black holes as a standard ruler for cosmological applications assuming the black hole mass can be determined independently. First, observations at low redshift distances can be used to constrain the Hubble constant independently. Secondly, the angular size of shadows of high redshift black holes is increased due to cosmic expansion and may also be reachable with future observations. This would allow us to probe the cosmic expansion history for the redshift range elusive to other distance measurements. Additionally, shadow can be used to estimate the mass of black holes at high redshift, assuming that cosmology is known.",2019,[],4

In addition, nearly extremal Kerr-Mog black holes can be continuously driven to extremality by test fields. Next, we employ backreaction effects based on the argument that the angular velocity of the event horizon increases before the absorption of the test field.

For this purpose, we solve stellar structure equations and radial perturbation equations, both modified for a equation-dimensional spacetime (equation) considering that spacetime outside the object is described by a Schwarzschild-Tangherlini metric. These equations are integrated considering a MIT bag model equation of state extended for equation. We show that the spacetime dimension influences both the structure and stability of compact objects. For an interval of central energy densities equation and total masses equation, we show that the stars gain more stability when the dimension is increased. In addition, the maximum value of equation and the zero eigenfrequency of oscillation are found with the same value of equation; i.e., the peak value of equation marks the onset of instability. This indicates that the necessary and sufficient conditions to recognize regions constructed by stable and unstable equilibrium configurations against radial perturbations are, respectively, equation and equation. We obtain that some physical parameter of the compact object in a equation-dimensional spacetime, such as the radius and the mass, depend of the normalization.

We find that the mass of the black hole in the resulting spacetime takes the form equation, where the critical exponent equation is equal to equation. For the case equation, we show that the scalar field must be joined onto two pieces of Vaidya spacetimes to avoid a naked singularity. We also derive the power-law mass formula with equation.

The time scales describing these phenomena, including the transition from volume to fluid regime, are shown to fall within a small fraction of the first second when the fundamental constants of the theory are aligned with the Planck time. This model potentially offers a higher-dimensional alternative to scalar-field inflationary theory and a consistent cosmological theory, yielding a unified description of early- and late-time accelerated expansions via a 5D spacetime scenario.",2019,[],4

The position at which the particle stops will be different in general relativity and Randall-Sundrum model. This difference in the distance moved by the particle before stopping can be measured using a Nanoelectromechanical setup.

1910.09267,gr-qc,"The Multipolar Post-Minkowskian (MPM) formalism represents an approach for determining the metric density in the exterior of a compact source of matter. In the MPM formalism the metric density is given in harmonic coordinates and in terms of symmetric tracefree (STF) multipoles. In this investigation, the post-linear metric density of this formalism is used in order to determine the post-linear metric tensor in the exterior of a compact source of matter. The metric tensor is given in harmonic coordinates and in terms of STF multipoles. The post-linear metric coefficients are associated with an integration procedure. The integration of these post-linear metric coefficients is performed explicitly for the case of a stationary source, where the first multipoles (monopole and quadrupole) of the source are taken into account. These studies are a requirement for further investigations in the theory of light propagation aiming at highly precise astrometric measurements in the solar system, where the post-linear coefficients of the metric tensor of solar system bodies become relevant.",2019,[],4
1910.03462,gr-qc,"Recent studies of scalar and gravitational waveforms from high-eccentricity, extreme mass-ratio black hole binaries show the presence of quasi-normal bursts (QNB) -- lingering high frequency decaying oscillations (also known as 'wiggles') -- soon after each periapsis passage. One puzzle associated with these QNB is that in the case of a nearly-extreme rotating central black hole the frequency of the QNB has been found to be in a range which is lower than the corresponding range of relevant quasi-normal modes. We reproduce these results using a different approach and perform a detailed analysis to find evidence for the resolution of the puzzle and for the origin of the QNB. We find that the QNB frequency as measured at future null infinity evolves in (retarded) time and approaches the dominant quasi-normal frequency exponentially in time. We also show that the QNB amplitude decays inversely in (retarded) time. We discuss the time dependence of both the QNB waveform frequency and its amplitude and argue that this behavior arises as a result of the excitation of many quasi-normal overtones and the summation thereof.",2019,[],4

Toward this purpose we have used two methods: Firstly, we have applied the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (GBT) and the optical geometry to evaluate the deflection angle of charged particles. Secondly, we have presented a detailed analysis of the deflection angle by means of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation recovering the same invariant result for the deflection angle in leading order terms. The crucial point behind the first method is to use the correspondence between the motion of a charged massive particles in a gravitational field in presence of electromagnetic field and the motion of photons in a non-homogeneous cold plasma. It is shown that the deflection angle besides the black hole (BH) mass equation, BH angular momentum equation, BH electric charge equation, BH magnetic charge equation, it is also affected by the electric charge of the particle equation and relativistic velocity of the particle equation.",2019,[],4

For (i), we find that the transition rate on a Rindler trajectory is non-thermal, and dependent on the direction, but thermality is restored in the low and high frequency regimes, with a direction-dependent temperature, and also in the regime of high acceleration compared with the detector's inverse size.

1908.05971,gr-qc,"In the gravitational collapse of matter beyond spherical symmetry, gravitational waves are necessarily present. On the other hand, gravitational waves can collapse to a black hole even without matter. One might therefore wonder whether the interaction and competition between the matter fields and gravitational waves affects critical phenomena at the threshold of black hole formation. As a toy model for this, we study type II critical collapse with two matter fields in spherical symmetry, namely a scalar field and a Yang-Mills field. On their own, both display discrete self-similarity (DSS) in type II critical collapse, and we can take either one of them as a toy model for gravitational waves. To our surprise, in numerical time evolutions we find that, for sufficiently good fine-tuning, the scalar field always dominates on sufficiently small scales. We explain our results by the conjectured existence of a ""quasi-discretely self-similar"" (QSS) solution shared by the two fields, equal to the known Yang-Mills critical solution at infinitely large scales and the known scalar field critical solution (the Choptuik solution) at infinitely small scales, with a gradual transition from one field to the other. This QSS solution itself has only one unstable mode, and so acts as the critical solution for any mixture of scalar field and Yang-Mills initial data.",2019,[],4
1906.02507,gr-qc,"The scale dependent effective average action for quantum gravity complies with the fundamental principle of Background Independence. Ultimately the background metric it formally depends on is selected self-consistently by means of a suitable generalization of Einstein's equation. Self-consistent backround spacetimes are scale dependent, and therefore ""going on-shell"" at the points along a given renormalization group (RG) trajectory requires understanding two types of scale dependencies: the (familiar) direct one carried by the off-shell action functional, and an indirect one related to the self-consistent background geometry. This paper is devoted to a careful delineation and analysis of certain general questions concerning the indirect scale dependence, as well as a detailed explicit investigation of the case where the self-consistent metrics are determined predominantly by the RG running of the cosmological constant. Mathematically, the object of interest is the spectral flow induced by the background Laplacian which, on-shell, acquires an explicit scale dependence. It encodes the information about the specific set of field modes which, at any given scale, are the degrees of freedom constituting the respective effective field theory. For a large class of RG trajectories we discover a seemingly paradoxical behavior: the theory looses rather than gains degrees of freedom at increasing energies. As an application, we investigate to what extent it is possible to reformulate the exact theory in terms of matter and gravity fluctuations on a rigid flat space. It turns out that, in vacuo, this ""rigid picture"" breaks down after a very short RG time. Furthermore, we reanalyze, and refute the claim that the huge energy densities one obtains in standard quantum field theory by summing up to zero-point energies imply a naturalness problem for the observed small value of the cosmological constant.",2019,[],4
1908.10316,gr-qc,"We determine the caloric curves of classical self-gravitating systems at statistical equilibrium in general relativity. In the classical limit, the caloric curves of a self-gravitating gas depend on a unique parameter equation, called the compactness parameter, where equation is the particle number and equation the system's size. Typically, the caloric curves have the form of a double spiral. The ""cold spiral"", corresponding to weakly relativistic configurations, is a generalization of the caloric curve of nonrelativistic classical self-gravitating systems. The ""hot spiral'"", corresponding to strongly relativistic configurations, is similar (but not identical) to the caloric curve of the ultrarelativistic self-gravitating black-body radiation. We introduce two types of normalization of energy and temperature in order to obtain asymptotic caloric curves describing respectively the cold and the hot spirals in the limit equation. As the number of particles increases, the cold and the hot spirals approach each other, merge at equation, form a loop above equation, reduce to a point at equation, and finally disappear. Therefore, the double spiral shrinks when the compactness parameter equation increases, implying that general relativistic effects render the system more unstable.

1909.12753,gr-qc,"Several space missions such as GRACE, GRAIL, ACES and others rely on intersatellite communications (ISC) between two satellites at a large distance one from another. The main goal of the theory is to formulate all the navigation observables within the General Relativity Theory (GRT). The same approach should be applied also to the intersatellite GPS-communications (in perspective also between the GPS, GLONASS and Galileo satellite constellations). In this paper a theoretical approach has been developed for ISC between two satellites moving on (one-plane) elliptical orbits based on the introduction of two gravity null cones with origins at the emitting-signal and receiving-signal satellites. The two null cones account for the variable distance between the satellites during their uncorrelated motion. This intersection of the two null cones gives the space-time interval in GRT. Applying some theorems from higher algebra, it was proved that this space-time distance can become zero, consequently it can be also negative and positive. But in order to represent the geodesic distance travelled by the signal, the space-time interval has to be ""compatible"" with the Euclidean distance. So this ""compatibility condition"", conditionally called ""condition for ISC"", is the most important consequence of the theory. The other important consequence is that the geodesic distance turns out to be the space-time interval, but with account also of the ""condition for ISC"". The geodesic distance is proved to be greater than the Euclidean distance - a result, entirely based on the ""two null cones approach"" and moreover, without any use of the Shapiro delay formulae. Application of the same higher algebra theorems shows that the geodesic distance cannot have any zeroes, in accord with being greater than the Euclidean distance.",2019,[],4
1907.07651,gr-qc,"As evidenced by a great number of works, it is common practice to assume that the Universe is flat. However, the majority of studies which make use of observational data to constrain the curvature density parameter are premised on the equationCDM cosmology, or extensions thereof. On the other hand, fitting the data to models with a time-varying dark energy equation of state can, in some cases, accommodate a non-flat Universe. Several authors caution that if the assumption of spatial flatness is wrong, it could veer any efforts to construct a dark energy model completely off course, even if the curvature is in reality very small. We thus consider a number of alternative dynamical dark energy models that represent the complete cosmological scenario, and investigate the effects of spatial curvature on the evolution. We find that for a closed Universe, the transition to the epoch of decelerated expansion would be delayed with respect to the flat case. So would the start of the current dark energy-dominated era. This would be accompanied by a larger inflationary acceleration, as well as a larger subsequent deceleration. The opposite behavior is observed if the Universe is open.",2019,[],4
1912.00470,gr-qc,"In case of a spherically symmetric non-linear scalar field (SF) in flat space, besides singularity at the center, spherical singularities can occur for non-zero values of radial variable equation. We show that in the General Relativity the gravitational field suppresses the occurrence of the spherical singularities under some generic conditions. Our consideration deals with asymptotically flat space-times around static spherically symmetric configurations in presence of equation non-linear SFs, which are minimally coupled to gravity. Constraints are imposed on the SF potentials, which guarantee a monotonicity of the fields as functions of radial variable; also the potentials are assumed to be exponentially bounded. We give direct proof that solutions of the joint system of Einstein -- SF equations satisfying the conditions of asymptotic flatness are regular for all values of equation, except for naked singularities in the center equation in the Schwarzschild (curvature) coordinates. Asymptotic relations for SF and metric near the center are derived, which appear to be remarkably similar to the case of the Fisher solution for free SF. These relations determine two main types of the corresponding geodesic structure when photons can be captured by the singularity or not depending on the existence of the photon sphere. To illustrate, the case of one SF with monomial potential is analyzed in detail numerically. We show that the image of the accretion disk around the singularity, observed from infinity, can take the form of a bright ring with a dark spot in the center, like the case of an ordinary black hole.",2019,[],4

1904.00506,gr-qc,"We consider spherically-symmetric black holes in semiclassical gravity. For a collapsing radiating thin shell we derive a sufficient condition on the exterior geometry that ensures that a black hole is not formed.

Taking the presence of a trapped region and its outer boundary --- the apparent horizon--- as the defining feature of black holes, we explore the consequences of their finite time of formation according to a distant observer. Assuming regularity of the apparent horizon we obtain the limiting form of the metric and the energy-momentum tensor in its vicinity that violates the null energy condition (NEC). The metric does not satisfy the sufficient condition for horizon avoidance: a thin shell collapses to form a black hole and test particles (unless too slow) cross into it in finite time. However, there may be difficulty in maintaining the expected range of the NEC violation, and stability against perturbations is not assured.",2019,[],4

Special applications to two classes of equation gravity toy models, namely equation and equation, have then been made within the observationally viable regions of their respective parameter spaces, and the growth of the matter density contrast for both torsion-dust and torsion-radiation epochs of the Universe has been examined. The exact solutions of the dust perturbations, with growing amplitudes in cosmic time, are obtained for some limiting cases of n. Similarly, the long- and short-wavelength modes in the torsion-radiation case are treated, with the amplitudes either oscillating or monotonically growing with time.

1907.08308,gr-qc,"Gravitational effect of ""magnetic type"" -- those having a curl-like character over large spheres -- are investigated, for isolated systems. The Bondi-Sachs-Newman-Penrose formalism clarifies a number of points, especially related to radiation memory. It is shown that the ""memory tensor"" is equivalent to the change in Bondi shear, from before to after the emission of radiation. This means that if magnetic radiation memory is present, at least one of the intervals bracketing the radiation must have non-zero magnetic shear but vanishing radiation. Such intervals, called here CPMS regimes, are shown to be necessarily non-stationary, however, raising a variety of technical and interpretative issues. In linearized general relativity, the gravitational fields due to point magnetic quadrupoles with arbitrary time-dependence are computed, and some of their physics studied. In the far zone, there is a red-shift effect which could be searched for astrophysically: light coming from behind a source generating magnetic shear would be red-shifted by an amount varying with the angle around the source of shear, and in the far-field limit this red-shift goes inversely with the impact parameter. Induction-zone effects are also considered. An induction-zone memory effect should exist which could possibly be within the reach of laboratory experiments, but no good candidates for astrophysically detectable effects are found.

We begin by considering the geometric-optics limit, in which the gravitational wave propagates along null geodesics of the spacetime; we show that a wavefront passing through a neutron star of tenuity equation will be focussed at a cusp caustic near the star's surface. Next, using the linearized Einstein Field Equations on a spherically-symmetric spacetime, we construct the metric perturbations in the odd and even parity sectors; and, with partial-wave methods, we numerically compute the gravitational scattering cross section from helicity-conserving and helicity-reversing amplitudes. At long wavelengths, the cross section is insensitive to stellar structure and, in the limit equation, it reduces to the known low-frequency approximation of the black hole case. At higher frequencies equation, the gravitational wave probes the internal structure of the body. In essence, we find that the gravitational wave cross section is similar to that for a massless scalar field, although with subtle effects arising from the non-zero helicity-reversing amplitude, and the coupling in the even-parity sector between the gravitational wave and the fluid of the body. The cross section exhibits \emphrainbow scattering with an Airy-type oscillation superposed on a Rutherford cross section. We show that the rainbow angle, which arises from a stationary point in the geodesic deflection function, depends on the polytropic index.

1910.05097,gr-qc,"In this work we present the results of a search for continuous gravitational waves from the Galactic Center using LIGO O2 data. The search uses the Band-Sampled-Data directed search pipeline, which performs a semi-coherent wide-parameter-space search, exploiting the robustness of the FrequencyHough transform algorithm. The search targets signals emitted by isolated asymmetric spinning neutron stars, located within 25-150 parsecs from the Galactic Center. The frequencies covered in this search range between 10 and 710 Hz with a spin-down range from equation to equation Hz/s. No continuous wave signal has been detected and upper limits on the gravitational wave amplitude are presented. The most stringent upper limit at equation confidence level, for the Livingston detector, is equation at frequencies near 160 Hz. To date, this is the most sensitive directed search for continuous gravitational-wave signals from the Galactic Center and the first search of this kind using the LIGO second observing run.",2019,[],4
1912.04455,gr-qc,"The problem of gravitational wave parameter estimation and source localization is crucial in gravitational wave astronomy. Gravitational waves emitted by compact binary coalescences in the sensitivity band of second-generation ground-based detectors could have non-negligible eccentricities. Thus it is an interesting topic to study how the eccentricity of a binary source affects and improves the accuracy of its localization (and the signal-to-noise ratio). In this work we continue to investigate this effect with the enhanced postcircular waveform model. Using the Fisher information matrix method, we determine the accuracy of source localization with three ground-based detector networks. As expected, the accuracy of source localization is improved considerably with more detectors in a network. We find that the accuracy also increases significantly by increasing the eccentricity for the large total mass (equation) binaries with all three networks. For the small total mass (equation) binaries, this effect is negligible. For the smaller total mass (equation) binaries, the accuracy could be even worse at some orientations with increasing eccentricity. This phenomenon comes mainly from how well the frequency of the higher harmonic modes induced by increasing eccentricity coincides with the sensitive bandwidth of the detectors. For the case of the equation black hole binary, the improvement factor is about equation in general when the eccentricity grows from equation to equation. For the cases of the equation black hole binary and the equation neutron star binary, the improvement factor is less than equation, and it may be less than 1 at some orientations.",2019,[],4

This is described using a generalisation of Gullstrand-Painlev\'e coordinates which allows for any possible radial velocity. This foliation provides a contrast with the usual static foliation implied by Schwarzschild coordinates. The equation-dimensional spaces are distinct for the static and falling observers, so the embedding diagrams, spatial measurement, simultaneity, and time at infinity are also distinct, though the equation-dimensional spacetime is unchanged. Our motivation is conceptual understanding, to counter Newton-like viewpoints. In future work, this alternate foliation may shed light on open questions regarding quantum fields, analogue gravity, entropy, energy, and other quantities.

In particular, we considered the Holographic Ricci dark energy and Extended holographic Ricci dark energy models. During this analysis we considered seven type of phenomenological interaction terms (three linear and four non-linear) equation, equation, equation, equation, equation, equation, equation respectively. To find the best model we apply Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and use the equationCDM as the referring model for comparison. Using AIC and BIC models selection method we note that the equation and equation interaction terms are favored by observational data within the context of the holographic Ricci dark energy models. The obtained results also demonstrated that the considered types of holographic Ricci dark energy model are not favored by observational data since the equationCDM is considered as the reference model. We also observed that the values of the deceleration parameter and the transition redshift for all models are compatible with the latest observational data and Planck 2015. In addition, we studied the jerk parameter for all models.

1903.09862,gr-qc,"The well-known problem of wormholes in general relativity (GR) is the necessity of exotic matter, violating the Weak Energy Condition (WEC), for their support. This problem looks easier if, instead of island-like configurations, one considers string-like ones, among them, cylindrically symmetric space-times with rotation. However, for cylindrical wormhole solutions a problem is the lacking asymptotic flatness, making it impossible to observe their entrances as local objects in our Universe. It was suggested to solve this problem by joining a wormhole solution to flat asymptotic regions at some surfaces equation and equation on different sides of the throat. The configuration then consists of three regions, the internal one containing a throat and two flat external ones. We discuss different kinds of source matter suitable for describing the internal regions of such models (scalar fields, isotropic and anisotropic fluids) and present two examples where the internal matter itself and the surface matter on both junction surfaces equation respect the WEC. In one of these models the internal source is a stiff perfect fluid whose pressure is equal to its energy density, in the other it is a special kind of anisotropic fluid. Both models are free from closed timelike curves. We thus obtain examples of regular twice asymptotically flat wormhole models in GR without exotic matter and without causality violations.",2019,[],4

The source of dissipation is considered to be a bulk viscous pressure equation which leads to an adiabatic creation of particles induced by the gravitational field. Further, the cosmic substratum is assumed to satisfy the equation of state equation and equation is considered to be proportional to equation, where equation is the Hubble parameter and equation is the index of dissipation. This choice of dissipation is consistent with the pioneering works by Barrow and Clifton. Finally, by assuming an exponential form for equation given by equation, where equation is a positive real parameter and which bears all the signatures of an emergent universe, we have been able to establish that the sufficiency of the inequality equation can produce a class of emergent universes. However, this condition is by no means necessary for the existence of an emergent universe.",2019,[],4

In the framework of this general setup we have recognized several general features of the system, like symmetries, invariant subsets and critical points, and provide their cosmological interpretation.

We have tested some general forms of the scale factor equation, and used two physically reasonable forms which have been proved to be consistent with observations. Both solutions predict a sign flipping in the evolution of cosmic pressure which is positive during the early-time deceleration and negative during the late-time acceleration. This sign flipping in the evolution of cosmic pressure helps in explaining the cosmic deceleration-acceleration transition, and it has appeared in other cosmological models in different contexts. However, the current work shows a pressure singularity which needs to be explained. The evolution of the equation of state parameter equation shows the same asymptotic behavior for both solutions indicating a quintessence-dominated universe in the far future. We also note that equation goes to negative values (leaving the decelerating dust-dominated era at equation) at exactly the same time the pressure becomes negative. Again, there is another singularity in the behavior of equation which happens at the same cosmic time of the pressure singularity.",2019,[],4
1909.13390,gr-qc,"We show that the simplest FLRW cosmological system consisting in the homogeneous and isotropic massless Einstein-Scalar system enjoys a hidden conformal symmetry under the 1D conformal group equation acting as Mobius transformations in proper time. This invariance is made explicit through the mapping of FLRW cosmology onto conformal mechanics. On the one hand, we identify the corresponding conformal Noether charges, as combinations of the Hamiltonian scalar constraint, the extrinsic curvature and the 3D volume, which form a closed equation Lie algebra. On the other hand, this approach allows to write FLRW cosmology in terms of a AdSequation phase space and a Schwarzian action. Preserving this conformal structure at the quantum level fixes the ordering ambiguities in the Wheeler-de Witt quantization and allows to formulate FLRW quantum cosmology as a CFTequation. We show that the CFT two-points correlator is realized as the overlap of the evolution in proper time of cosmological coherent wave-packets. In particular, the two-points function is built from a vacuum state which, although not conformally invariant, coincides with the cosmological vacuum annihilated by the scalar constraint.

We have also recovered results by Ben-Dov and Senovilla which put cut-offs on the equation of state parameter equation, determining the spacelike, timelike and non-expanding horizons in the the Robertson-Walker class of spacetimes. We show that stability of marginally trapped surfaces (MTS) in the Robertson-Walker spacetimes is only achievable under the conditions of negative pressure, and also classify the spacelike future outer trapping horizons (SFOTH) in the Robertson-Walker spacetimes via bounds on the equation of state parameter equation. For the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) model, it is shown that a relationship between the energy density and the electric part of the Weyl curvature, equation, gives the causal classification of the MTTs. It is further shown that only spacelike MTTs are foliated by stable MTS, and that this stability guarantees no shell crossing.

Moreover, we investigate the effect of a plasma medium on deflection of light for a given black hole.

Due to difference in the signs of these forces the total free field Lagrangian contains different signs for the tensor and scalar dynamical fields. Generalized Fierz-Pauli mass term in total spin-2 plus spin-0 Lagrangian gives natural massless limit for mg to 0, so the mass discontinuity paradox is absent.

Several classes of modified gravity predict the existence of such a transition - known as spontaneous scalarization - associated with the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a scalar field near a compact object. Using a strong-field-agnostic effective-field-theory approach, we show that all theories that exhibit spontaneous scalarization can also manifest dynamical scalarization, a phase transition associated with symmetry breaking in a binary system. We derive an effective point-particle action that provides a simple parametrization describing both phenomena, which establishes a foundation for theory-agnostic searches for scalarization in gravitational-wave observations.

In the absence of a potential for the mimetic field, our solutions can address the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies and alleviate the dark matter problem without invoking any kind of particle dark matter. Thus, mimetic gravity can provide a theoretical background for understanding flat galactic rotation curves through modification of the Schwarzschild spacetime. We also investigate the casual structure and physical properties of the solutions. The presence of the mimetic field changes the asymptotic behaviour of the spacetime. We observe that in the absence of a potential, our solutions are not asymptotically flat, while, in the presence of a negative constant potential for the mimetic field, the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions can be anti de-Sitter (AdS). Finally, we explore the motion of massless and massive particles and give a list of the types of orbits. We study the differences of geodesic motion in Einstein gravity and in mimentic gravity.

We find the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the model, which depends on several parameters. We study the case in which parameter values are chosen so that the solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation are bounded. Initially, we solve it using the \it Many Worlds interpretation. Using wavepackets computed with the solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, we obtain the scalar factor expected value equation. We show that this quantity oscillates between finite maximum and minimum values and never vanishes. Such result indicates that the model is free from singularities, at the quantum level. We reinforce this indication by showing that by subtracting one standard deviation unit from the expected value equation, the latter remains positive. Then, we use the \it DeBroglie-Bohm interpretation. Initially, we compute the Bohm's trajectories for the scale factor and show that they never vanish.

1905.13542,gr-qc,"We study the late-time asymptotic state of a stationary Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a field in a thermal state. We work in an open system framework, where the field plays the role of an environment for the detector. The long-time interaction between the detector and the field is modelled with the aid of a one-parameter family of switching functions that turn on and off the interaction Hamiltonian between the two subsystems, such that the long-time interaction limit is reached as the family parameter goes to infinity. In such limit, we show that if the field is in a Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) state and the detector is stationary with respect to the notion of positive frequency of the field, in the Born-Markov approximation, the asymptotic state of the detector is a Gibbs state at the KMS temperature. We then relax the KMS condition for the field state, and require only that a frequency-dependent version of the detailed balance condition for the Wightman function pulled back to the detector worldline hold, in the sense that the inverse temperature appearing in the detailed balance relation need not be constant. In this setting, we show that the late-time asymptotic state of the detector has the form of a thermal density matrix, but with a frequency-dependent temperature. We present examples of these results, which include the classical Unruh effect and idealised Hawking radiation (for fields in the HHI state), and also the study of the late-time behaviour of detectors following stationary ""cusped"" and circular motions in Minkowski space interacting with a massless Klein-Gordon field in the Minkowski vacuum.

We then explicitly derive the equation of state parameter of the torsion fluid equation and study its evolution for vacuum-torsion, radiation-torsion, dust-torsion, stiff fluid torsion, and radiation-dust-torsion multi-fluid systems. The obtained Lagrangians have, in general, matter dependence due to the matter-torsion coupling appearing in the energy density and pressure terms of the modified teleparallel gravity theory. For the simplest CG models, however, it is possible to reconstruct equation Lagrangians that depend explicitly on the torsion scalar equation only. The preliminary results show that, in addition to providing Chaplygin-gas-like solutions to the modified teleparallel gravitation, which naturally behave like dark matter and dark energy at early and late times respectively, the technique can be used to overcome some of the challenges attributed to the CG cosmological alternative.",2019,[],4

It turns out that the radius of the event horizon of a scalar field black hole always less than the Schwarzschild radius of vacuum black hole of the same mass and can be arbitrary close to zero. In astronomical observations, a key role in distinguishing between black holes, wormholes, and naked singularities plays measuring parameters of bound quasiperiodic orbits, in particular, the shape of an orbit and the angle of precession of its pericentre. We consider a typical two-parameter family of compact scalar field black holes and compute numerically the shapes of some bound orbits.

In the theory in which spontaneous scalarization takes place, the Schwarzschild solution with a trivial profile of the scalar field exhibits a tachyonic instability in the vicinity of the event horizon, and evolves into a hairy BH solution.

As Finsler geometry is a straightforward generalisation of Riemannian geometry there are many attempts to use it as generalized geometry of spacetime in physics. However, this generalisation is subtle due to the existence of non-trivial null directions. I review how a pseudo-Finsler spacetime geometry can be defined such that it provides a precise notion of causal curves, observers and their measurements as well as a gravitational field equation determining the Finslerian spacetime geometry dynamically. The construction of such Finsler spacetimes lays they foundation for comparing their predictions with observations, in astrophysics as well as in laboratory experiments.",2019,[],4

Then, we use the formalism of geometrothermodynamics to show that the spatial distance between the black holes must be considered as a thermodynamic variable. We investigate the main thermodynamic properties of the system by using the contact structure of the phase space, which generates the first law of thermodynamics and the equilibrium conditions. The phase transition structure of the system is investigated through the curvature singularities of the equilibrium space.

1911.10440,gr-qc,"The tidal deformations of neutron stars within an inspiraling compact binary alter the orbital dynamics, imprinting a signature on the gravitational wave signal. Modeling this signal could be done with numerical-relativity simulations, but these are too computationally expensive for many applications. Analytic post-Newtonian treatments are limited by unknown higher-order nontidal terms. This paper further builds upon the ""tidal splicing"" model in which post-Newtonian tidal terms are ""spliced"" onto numerical relativity simulations of black-hole binaries. We improve on previous treatments of tidal splicing by including spherical harmonic modes beyond the (2,2) mode, expanding the post-Newtonian expressions for tidal effects to 2.5 order, including dynamical tide corrections, and adding a partial treatment of the spin-tidal dynamics. Furthermore, instead of numerical relativity simulations, we use the spin-aligned binary black hole (BBH) surrogate model ""NRHybSur3dq8"" to provide the BBH waveforms that are input into the tidal slicing procedure. This allows us to construct spin-aligned, inspiraling TaylorT2 and TaylorT4 splicing waveform models that can be evaluated quickly. These models are tested against existing binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star simulations. We implement the TaylorT2 splicing model as an extension to ""NRHybSur3dq8,"" creating a model that we call ""NRHybSur3dq8Tidal.""",2019,[],4

Furthermore, such acceleration can be deduced differentiating the potential of the trap, which leads us to infer that, for a Bose-Einstein condensate in an arbitrary trap, the space-time interval will correspond to the conformal equivalent of that of an accelerated observer, being the acceleration in any direction proportional to the partial derivative of the trap potential of the BEC with respect to that coordinate.

1903.08284,gr-qc,"It is possible to infer the mass and spin of the remnant black hole from binary black hole mergers by comparing the ringdown gravitational wave signal to results from studies of perturbed Kerr spacetimes. Typically these studies are based on the fundamental quasinormal mode of the dominant equation harmonic. By modeling the ringdown of accurate numerical relativity simulations, we find that the fundamental mode alone is insufficient to recover the true underlying mass and spin, unless the analysis is started very late in the ringdown. Including higher overtones associated with this equation harmonic resolves this issue, and provides an unbiased estimate of the true remnant parameters. Further, including overtones allows for the modeling of the ringdown signal for all times beyond the peak strain amplitude, indicating that the linear quasinormal regime starts much sooner than previously expected. A model for the ringdown beginning at the peak strain amplitude can exploit the higher signal-to-noise ratio in detectors, reducing uncertainties in the extracted remnant quantities. Tests of the no-hair theorem should consider incorporating overtones in the analysis.",2019,[],4

We examine the thermodynamics of the system interpreting the cosmological constant as a bulk pressure. We use the standard counterterm method to obtain a finite Euclidean action. For a given coupling of the matter action, the system behaves as does a charged AdS black hole in the fixed charged ensemble.

For the equation spin-weighted spherical harmonic mode we construct eccentric hybrid waveforms that connect the numerical relativity data to a post-Newtonian description for the inspiral, and we discuss the limitations in the current knowledge about post-Newtonian theory which complicate the generation of eccentric hybrid waveforms. We also perform a Bayesian parameter estimation study, quantifying the parameter biases introduced when using three different quasicircular waveform models to estimate the parameters of highly eccentric binary systems.

1901.09072,gr-qc,"Measurements of multiple harmonic modes in the gravitational wave signals from binary black hole events could provide an accurate test of general relativity, however they have never been observed before. The sub-dominant modes, other than the main (l = 2, m = 2) mode, are weak in amplitude and thus difficult to detect in a single event at the current sensitivity of the gravitational wave detectors. To recover sub-dominant modes, we propose an unmodeled method for summation of signals from a population of binary black holes. The method coherently stacks all the signal modes, effectively increasing their signal-to-noise ratio, so the amplified signal can be extracted from the noisy data. To test the method, we consider simulated numerical relativity waveforms including sub-dominant modes up to (5, 5). We inject simulated signals from a population of binary black holes into data from the first observing run of Advanced LIGO and utilize the coherent WaveBurst algorithm for signal detection and reconstruction. Using only the waveforms reconstructed by coherent WaveBurst, i.e., no a priori information about the signal model, we determine the transformation to coherently synchronize the merger and post-merger of one signal to another.

1902.06088,gr-qc,"We investigate the spacetime of a spinning cosmic string in conformal invariant gravity, where the interior consists of a gauged scalar field. We find exact solutions of the exterior of a stationary spinning cosmic string, where we write the metric as equation, with equation a dilaton field which contains all the scale dependences. The ""unphysical"" metric equation is related to the equation-dimensional Kerr spacetime. The equation for the angular momentum equation decouples, for the vacuum situation as well as for global strings, from the other field equations and delivers a kind of spin-mass relation. For the most realistic solution, equation falls off as equation and equation close to the core. The spacetime is Ricci flat. The formation of closed timelike curves can be pushed to space infinity for suitable values of the parameters and the violation of the weak energy condition can be avoided. For the interior, a numerical solution is found. This solution can easily be matched at the boundary on the exterior exact solution by special choice of the parameters of the string. It turns out, as expected from the ""holographic"" principle, that the exact solution of the exterior is equivalent with the warped five-dimensional brane world model, with only a cosmological constant in the bulk.

From the quantization of the Schwarzschild radius it was possible to determine the area of the black hole event horizon, its mass and the quantum energy of the Hawking radiation as well as its frequency.

1906.02958,gr-qc,"We analyze Hawking radiation as perceived by a freely-falling observer and try to draw an inference about the region of origin of the Hawking quanta. To do so, first we calculate the energy density from the stress energy tensor, as perceived by a freely-falling observer. Then we compare this with the energy density computed from an effective temperature functional which depends on the state of the observer. The two ways of computing these quantities show a mismatch at the light ring outside the black hole horizon. To better understand this ambiguity, we show that even taking into account the (minor) breakdown of the adiabatic evolution of the temperature functional which has a peak in the same region of the mismatch, is not enough to remove it. We argue that the appearance of this discrepancy can be traced back to the process of particle creation by showing how the Wentzel--Kramers--Brillouin approximation for the field modes breaks down between the light ring at equation and equation, with a peak at equation exactly where the energy density mismatch is maximized. We hence conclude that these facts strongly support a scenario where the Hawking flux does originate from a ""quantum atmosphere"" located well outside the black hole horizon.",2019,[],4

Neutron stars in scalar-tensor theories develop scalar charges, which directly enter the timing model for binary pulsars. In this paper, we calculate and tabulate these scalar charges in two popular, massless scalar tensor theories for a collection of neutron star equations of state that are compatible with constraints placed by the recent, gravitational wave observations of a binary neutron star coalescence. We then study these scalar charges and explore analytic scaling relations that allow us to predict their value in a large region of parameter space.

The coherent response of the LIGO-Virgo network of detectors is estimated by using loose bounds on the duration and bandwidth of the signal. This pipeline version reproduces the same results that are reported for cWB in recent publications by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations. In particular, the sky localization and waveform reconstruction are in a good agreement with those produced by methods which exploit the detailed theoretical knowledge of the expected waveform for compact binary coalescences.

1901.00218,gr-qc,"We consider the restoration of a spontaneously broken symmetry of an interacting quantum scalar field around neutral, i.e., Schwarzschild, and electrically charged, i.e., Reissner-Nordstrom, black holes in four dimensions. This is done through a semiclassical self-consistent procedure, by solving the system of non-linear coupled equations describing the dynamics of the background field and the vacuum polarization. The black hole at its own horizon generates an indefinitely high temperature which decreases to the Hawking temperature at infinity. Due to the high temperature in its vicinity, there forms a bubble around the black hole in which the scalar field can only assume a value equal to zero, a minimum of energy. Thus, in this region the symmetry of the energy and the field is preserved. At the bubble radius, there is a phase transition in the value of the scalar field due to a spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism. Indeed, outside the bubble radius the temperature is low enough such that the scalar field settles with a nonzero value in a new energy minimum, indicating a breaking of the symmetry in this outer region. Conversely, there is symmetry restoration from the outer region to the inner bubble close to the horizon. Specific properties that emerge from different black hole electric charges are also noteworthy. It is found that colder black holes, i.e., more charged ones, have a smaller bubble length of restored symmetry. In the extremal case the bubble has zero length, i.e., there is no bubble. Additionally, for colder black holes, it becomes harder to excite the quantum field modes, so the vacuum polarization has smaller values.

In the context of coarse-graining, or equivalently of the definition of spin networks as projective limits of graphs, it appears natural to introduce excitations of curvature along the edges. An edge is then treated similarly to a propagator living on the links of Feynman diagrams in quantum field theory: curvature excitations create little loops -- tadpoles -- which renormalize it. This relaxes the area matching condition, with different spins at both ends of the edge. We show that this is equivalent to combining the usual SU(2) holonomy along the edge with a Lorentz boost into SL(2,C) group elements living on the spin network edges, underlining the fact that the Ashtekar-Barbero connection carries extrinsic curvature degrees of freedom. This finally leads us to introduce a new notion of area waves in loop quantum gravity.",2019,[],4

1911.12646,gr-qc,"Quantum gravity effects in effective models of loop quantum gravity, such as loop quantum cosmology, are encoded in the choice of so-called polymerisation schemes. Physical viability of the models, such as an onset of quantum effects at curvature scales near the Planck curvature, severely restrict the possible choices. An alternative point of view on the choice of polymerisation scheme is to choose adapted variables so that the scheme is the simplest possible one, known as equation-scheme in loop quantum cosmology. There, physically viable models with equation-scheme polymerise the Hubble rate equation that is directly related to the Ricci scalar and the matter energy density on-shell. Consequently, the onset of quantum effects depends precisely on those parameters. In this letter, we construct similar variables for black to white hole transitions modelled using the description of the Schwarzschild interior as a Kantowski-Sachs cosmology. The resulting model uses the equation-scheme and features sensible physics for a broad range of initial conditions (= choices of black and white hole masses) and favours symmetric transitions upon invoking additional qualitative arguments. The resulting Hamiltonian is very simple and at most quadratic in its arguments, allowing for a straight forward quantisation.",2019,[],4

We prove that the newly introduced flux and extrinsic curvature variables preserve the symplectic structure of the original variables. We then introduce the modified rotational constraint and succeed to write it as a Gauss constraint of a newly obtained connection. The newly obtained connection is slightly different from the classical 31 spacelike Sen-Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi connection as it contains in addition the Minkowski metric equation as a coefficient.

In our algorithm, each partial derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to one of phase-space variables is discretized by the average of eight Hamiltonian difference terms. Such a discretization form is a second-order approximation to the Hamiltonian gradient. It is shown numerically via simulations of an FPU-equation system and a post-Newtonian conservative system of compact binaries with one body spinning that the newly proposed method has extremely good energy-conserving performance, compared to the Runge-Kutta, implicit midpoint symplectic method and extended phase-space explicit symplectic-like integrators. The new method is advantageous over very long times and for large time steps compared to state-of-the-art Runge-Kutta method in the accuracy of numerical solutions. Although such an energy-conserving integrator exhibits a higher computational cost than any one of the other three algorithms, the superior results justify its use for satisfying some specific purposes on the preservation of energies in numerical simulations with much longer times, e.g. obtaining a high enough accuracy of the semimajor axis in a Keplerian problem in the Solar System or accurately grasping the frequency of a gravitational wave from a circular orbit in a post-Newtonian system of compact binaries.

The resulting construction has some similarities with the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations which describes the motion of the particle in an external field. We analyze the relationship between the center of mass velocity and the Bondi linear momentum and show they are not proportional to each other.

In this letter, we outline the theoretical principles of testing the dynamical Chern-Simons gravity with orbiting gravity gradiometers, which could be naturally incorporated into future satellite gravity missions. The secular gravity gradient signals, due to the Mashhoon-Theiss (anomaly) effect, in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity are worked out, which can improve the constraint of the corresponding Chern-Simons length scale equation obtained from such measurement scheme.

We observe that our black holes admit the multi-horizons caused by a quantum effect called anti-evaporation. Next, by calculating the conserved and thermodynamic quantities, we obtain a generalized Smarr formula. We find that the first law of black holes thermodynamics is satisfied on the black hole horizon. We study thermal stability of the obtained solutions in both canonical and grand canonical ensembles. We reveal that depending on the model parameters, our solutions exhibit a rich variety of phase structures. Finally, we explore, for the first time without extending thermodynamics phase space, the critical behavior and reentrant phase transition for black hole solutions in massive gravity theory.

1909.05877,gr-qc,"We present new results on the analytic eccentricity dependence of several sequences of gravitational wave flux terms at high post-Newtonian (PN) order for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. These sequences are the leading logarithms, which appear at PN orders equation and equation for integers equation (equation a PN compactness parameter), and the subleading logarithms, which appear at orders equation and equation (equation), in both the energy and angular momentum radiated to infinity. For the energy flux leading logarithms, we show that to arbitrarily high PN order their eccentricity dependence is determined by particular sums over the function equation, derived from the Newtonian mass quadrupole moment, that normally gives the spectral content of the Peters-Mathews flux as a function of radial harmonic equation. An analogous power spectrum equation determines the leading logarithms of the angular momentum flux. For subleading logs, the quadrupole power spectra are again shown to play a role, providing a distinguishable part of the eccentricity dependence of these flux terms to high PN order. With the quadrupole contribution understood, the remaining analytic eccentricity dependence of the subleading logs can in principle be determined more easily using black hole perturbation theory. We show this procedure in action, deriving the complete analytic structure of the equation subleading-log term and an analytic expansion of the equation subleading log to high order in a power series in eccentricity. We discuss how these methods might be extended to other sequences of terms in the PN expansion involving logarithms.",2019,[],4

After linearization in the spin of the particle, we obtain an excellent agreement (equation) between the two numerical results.The calculation of the multipolar fluxes is also performed analytically (up to equation) using the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion of the Teukolsky equation solution; each mode is obtained at 5.5PN order beyond the corresponding leading-order contribution. From the analytical fluxes we obtain the PN-expanded analytical waveform amplitudes. These quantities are then resummed using new procedures either based on the factorization of the orbital contribution (and resumming it independently from the spin-dependent factor) or on the factorization of the tail contribution solely for odd-parity multipoles. We compare these prescriptions and the resummation procedure proposed in Pan et al. [Phys. Rev. D 83 (2011) 064003] to the numerical data. We find that the new procedures significantly improve over the existing one that, notably, is inconsistent with the numerical data for equation multipoles already at low orbital frequencies.

Throats locations show that the spatial variation of the gravitational redshift at the throat of a static spherically symmetric wormhole sustained by an isotropic perfect fluid is always diverging, generalising the result that there is no such wormhole with zero-tidal force. Several specific static spherically symmetric wormholes models are studied. A vanishing density model leads to an exact solution of the field equation allowing to test our dynamical system formalism. It also shows how to extend it to the description of static black holes. Hence, the trajectory of the Schwarzschild black hole is determined.

As expected, differences arise when using an exponential coupling.

We show how the difference in the sign of the fundamental Poisson bracket is reflected in a sign of the modified source term in the Friedmann equation, responsible for the removal of the initial singularity in the polymer case and for the survival of a singular point in the Universe past, when the Generalized Uncertainty Principle is concerned.   Then, we study the regularization of the vacuum energy of a free massless scalar field, by implementing a second quantization formalism in the context of Polymer Quantum Mechanics.

Consequently, the similarity with the first law of thermodynamics implied by such an approach in general relativity does show up also in teleparallel gravity. It is found that, based on the expression of the first law of black hole mechanics, which is preserved in teleparallel gravity, entropy can thus be extracted from such a Noether charge. The resulting entropy can very naturally be expressed as a \it volume integral, though.

1912.05419,gr-qc,"Recently it has been argued that near-horizon modifications of the standard (classical) black hole spacetime could lead to observable alterations of the gravitational waveform generated by a binary black hole coalescence. Such modifications can be inspired by quantum gravity considerations, resulting in speculative horizonless exotic compact objects (ECOs) with no singularities, which may be an alternative to the classical black hole solution. A largely model-independent description of these objects proposed in the literature relies on the introduction of a partially reflective wall at some small distance away from the ""would-be"" horizon. The inspiral-merger-ringdown of a pair of such objects would be subject to possibly detectable deviations from the black hole case due to matter effects. In particular, the ringdown phase would be modified by the late emergence of so-called ""echoes"" in the waveform, but most studies so far have considered spherically symmetric backgrounds. We use an in-falling scalar charge as an initial perturbation to simulate the excitation of the echoes of a rotating ECO and we explore both the co-rotating and counter-rotating cases, which provide distinct signals. In particular, rotation breaks the symmetry between positive and negative frequencies and introduces a subdominant frequency contribution in each echo, which we examine here for the first time.

We also obtain its strong deflection lensing observables, including the apparent radius of the photon sphere as well as the angular separation, brightness difference and differential time delay between the relativistic images. Taking the supermassive black hole in the Galactic Center as the lens, we evaluate these observables and compare these signatures with those of the Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, tidal Reissner-Nordstrom and charged Galileon black holes. After a detailed analysis of the feasibility of measuring these lensing observables, we conclude that although it is possible to detect some leading effects of the weak and strong deflection lensings by the charged Horndeski and other black holes with current technology, it would be unlikely to distinguish one kind of these black holes from the others based on these detections in the near future due to lack of enough highly angular resolution in astronomical observations to tell their differences.",2019,[],4

1909.03970,gr-qc,"We consider the motion of charged and spinning bodies on the symmetry axis of a non-extremal Kerr-Newman black hole. If one treats the body as a test point particle of mass, equation, charge equation, and spin equation, then by dropping the body into the black hole from sufficiently near the horizon, the first order area increase, equation, of the black hole can be made arbitrarily small, i.e., the process can be done in a 'reversible' manner. At second order, there may be effects on the energy delivered to the black hole---quadratic in equation and equation---resulting from (i) the finite size of the body and (ii) self-force corrections to the energy. Sorce and Wald have calculated these effects for a charged, non-spinning body on the symmetry axis of an uncharged Kerr black hole. We consider the generalization of this process for a charged and spinning body on the symmetry axis of a Kerr-Newman black hole, where the self-force effects have not been calculated. A spinning body (with negligible extent along the spin axis) must have a mass quadrupole moment equation, so at quadratic order in the spin, we must take into account quadrupole effects on the motion. After taking into account all such finite size effects, we find that the condition equation yields a nontrivial lower bound on the self-force energy, equation, at the horizon. In particular, for an uncharged, spinning body on the axis of a Kerr black hole of mass equation, the net contribution of spin self-force to the energy of the body at the horizon is equation, corresponding to an overall repulsive spin self-force. A lower bound for the self-force energy, equation, for a body with both charge and spin at the horizon of a Kerr-Newman black hole is given.

To introduce such a dark energy contaminated black hole's gravitation, pseudo-Newtonian potential is popularly used. Transonic, viscous, continuous and Keplerian flow is assumed to take place. Fluid speed, sonic speed profile and specific angular momentum to Keplerian angular momentum ratio are found out for different values of spinning parameter and quintessence parameter.

1909.11749,gr-qc,"One method for the numerical treatment of future null-infinity is to decouple coordinates from the tensor basis and choose each in a careful manner. This dual-frame approach is hampered by logarithmically divergent terms that appear in a naive choice of evolved variables. Here we consider a system of wave equations that satisfy the weak-null condition and serve as a model system with similar nonlinearities to those present in the Einstein field equations in generalized harmonic gauge. We show that these equations can be explicitly regularized by a nonlinear change of variables. Working in spherical symmetry, a numerical implementation of this model using compactified hyperboloidal slices is then presented. Clean convergence is found for the regularized system. Although more complicated, it is expected that general relativity can be treated similarly.",2019,[],4
1909.07271,gr-qc,"This is the fourth paper in a series of four in which we use space adiabatic methods in order to incorporate backreactions among the homogeneous and between the homogeneous and inhomogeneous degrees of freedom in quantum cosmological perturbation theory. In this paper, we finally consider the gauge invariant scalar (Mukhanov-Sasaki) and tensor (primordial gravitational wave) inhomogeneous perturbations of General Relativity coupled to an inflaton field which arise from a careful constraint analysis of this system up to second order in the perturbations. The simultaneous quantisation of the homogeneous and inhomogeneous degrees of freedom suggests the space adiabatic perturbation theory as an approximation scheme in order to capture the backreaction effects between these two sets of degrees of freedom. We are confronted with all the challenges at once that we found in the simpler models treated in this series of papers. We are able to compute these effects up to second order in the adiabatic parameter and find significant modifications as compared to earlier derivations of the effective quantum dynamics of the homogeneous sector.",2019,[],4
1902.09495,gr-qc,"In this work we extend the so--called Minimal Geometric Deformation method in equation dimensional space--times with cosmological constant in order to deal with the gravitational decoupling of two circularly symmetric sources. We find that, even though the system here studied is lower dimensional and it includes the cosmological constant, the conditions for gravitational decoupling of two circularly symmetric sources coincides with those found in the equation dimensional case. We obtain that, under certain circumstances, the extended gravitational decoupling leads to the decoupling of the sources involved in the sense that both the isotropic and the anisotropic sector satisfy Einstein's field equations and the final solution corresponds to a non-linear superposition of two metric components. As particular examples, we implement the method to generate an exterior charged BTZ solution starting from the BTZ vacuum as the isotropic sector and new equation black hole solutions imposing a barotropic equation of state for the anisotropic sector. We also show that the imposition of a polytropic equation of state of the decoupler matter allows to construct a regular black hole solution in three--dimensional gravity.",2019,[],4
1910.07634,gr-qc,"It is widely accepted that the primordial universe experienced a brief period of accelerated expansion called inflation. This scenario provides a plausible solution to the horizon and flatness problems. However, the particle physics mechanism responsible for inflation remains speculative with, in particular , the assumption of a scalar field called inflaton. Furthermore, the comparison with the most recent data raises new questions that encourage the consideration of alternative hypotheses. Here, we propose a completely different scenario based on a mechanism whose origins lie in the nonlin-earities of the Einstein field equations. We use the analytical results of weak gravitational wave turbulence to develop a phenomenological theory of strong gravitational wave turbulence where the inverse cascade of wave action plays a key role. In this scenario, the space-time metric excitation triggers an explosive inverse cascade followed by the formation of a condensate in Fourier space whose growth is interpreted as an expansion of the universe. Contrary to the idea that gravitation can only produce a decelerating expansion, our study reveals that gravitational wave turbulence could be a source of inflation. The fossil spectrum that emerges from this scenario is shown to be in agreement with the cosmic microwave background radiation measured by the Planck mission.",2019,[],4

We consider the case of noninteracting bosons as well as the case of self-interacting bosons with a repulsive or an attractive self-interaction. These results may find application in the context of dark matter halos made of self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates. In that case, the central mass may mimic a supermassive black hole. We apply our results to ultralight axions with an attractive self-interaction.

We study the scattering of null geodesics and planar massless scalar waves by Schwarzschild black holes surrounded by a thin spherical shell of matter. We explore various configurations of this system, analyzing changes in mass fraction and radius of the shell.

1905.13519,gr-qc,"This article is devoted to the study of high dense charged anisotropic compact structures in the framework of equation gravity theory. The principal aims of this investigation, regard the extension of the isotropic Durgapal-Fuloria model within the context of charged isotropic equation solutions. The second main goal of this work is to apply the gravitational decoupling via a minimal geometric deformation (MGD) scheme in equation gravity. Finally, the third one is to derive an anisotropic version of the charged isotropic model previously obtained by applying gravitational decoupling technology. This MGD approach splits the system of equations into two separate sets, one corresponding with the f(R,equation) gravity system and another corresponding to the anisotropic sector governed by the extra source equation.To address this task we have considered some ingredients: I) the f(R,equation) model corresponds to a linear functional of the Ricci's scalar and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor equation, specifically equation, being equation a running coupling constant. II) The matter distribution is taken to be an isotropic fluid one, III) the Lagrangian matter equation corresponds to the negative isotropic pressure \i.e, equation and IV) in order to solve the equation-sector, a suitable form for the decoupler function equation has been imposed, respecting all the physical and mathematical requirements.

1903.09020,gr-qc,"Recently, it was argued that charged Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes admit critical behavior, without extending phase space, similar to the Van der Waals fluid system in the equation plans where equation (the conjugate of equation) is the inverse of the specific volume \citeDehy. In this picture, the square of the charge of the black hole, equation, is treated as a thermodynamic variable and the cosmological constant equation is fixed. In this paper, we would like to examine whether this new approach toward critical behaviour of AdS black holes can work in other gravity such as Gauss-Bonnet (GB) gravity as well as in higher dimensional spacetime. We obtain the equation of state, equation, Gibbs free energy and the critical quantities of the system, and study the effects of the GB coupling equation on their behaviour. We find out that the critical quantities have reasonable values, provided the GB coupling constant, equation, is taken small and the horizon topology is assumed to be equation-sphere.

The corresponding field equations are constructed and the unknown constants are obtained from junction conditions. We analyze the physical viability and stability of the resulting solutions through effective energy density, effective radial/tangential pressure, energy conditions, and causality condition.

1909.05811,gr-qc,"The idea of a graph theoretical approach to modeling the emergence of a quantized geometry and consequently spacetime, has been proposed previously, but not well studied. In most approaches the focus has been upon how to generate a spacetime that possesses properties that would be desirable at the continuum limit, and the question of how to model matter and its dynamics has not been directly addressed. Recent advances in network science have yielded new approaches to the mechanism by which spacetime can emerge as the ground state of a simple Hamiltonian, based upon a multi-dimensional Ising model with one dimensionless coupling constant. Extensions to this model have been proposed that improve the ground state geometry, but they require additional coupling constants. In this paper we conduct an extensive exploration of the graph properties of the ground states of these models, and a simplification requiring only one coupling constant. We demonstrate that the simplification is effective at producing an acceptable ground state. Moreover we propose a scheme for the inclusion of matter and dynamics as excitations above the ground state of the simplified Hamiltonian.

We present our method for calculation of QNMs of GW in the Schwarzschild metric with different boundary conditions. It is based on exact solutions of the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations in terms of the confluent Heun functions.

Thin-shell models are admittedly a poor substitute for realistic stellar models. But the simplicity of the equations that govern their dynamics, compared with the much more complicated mechanics of a self-gravitating fluid, allows us to deliver, in a very direct and easy manner, powerful insights regarding their equilibria and stability. We explore, in particular, the link between the existence of a maximum mass along a sequence of equilibrium configurations and the onset of dynamical instability. Such a link is well-established in the case of fluid bodies in both Newtonian gravity and general relativity, but the demonstration of this link is both subtle and difficult.

1912.00774,gr-qc,"In the past years, black holes and the fate of their singularity have been heavily studied within loop quantum gravity. Effective spacetime descriptions incorporating quantum geometry corrections are provided by the so-called polymer models. Despite the technical differences, the main common feature shared by these models is that the classical singularity is resolved by a black-to-white hole transition. In a recent paper, we discussed the existence of two Dirac observables in the effective quantum theory respectively corresponding to the black and white hole mass. Physical requirements about the onset of quantum effects then fix the relation between these observables after the bounce, which in turn corresponds to a restriction on the admissible initial conditions for the model. In the present paper, we discuss in detail the role of such observables in black hole polymer models. First, we revisit previous models and analyse the existence of the Dirac observables there. Observables for the horizons or the masses are explicitly constructed. In the classical theory, only one Dirac observable has physical relevance. In the quantum theory, we find a relation between the existence of two physically relevant observables and the scaling behaviour of the polymerisation scales under fiducial cell rescaling. We present then a new model based on polymerisation of new variables which allows to overcome previous restrictions on initial conditions. Quantum effects cause a bound of a unique Kretschmann curvature scale, independently of the relation between the two masses.",2019,[],4

We study a modification of this theory on a equation dimensional wormhole spacetime which has a spherical throat of radius equation, with a focus on the stability properties of the modified kink. In particular, we prove that the modified kink is linearly stable, and compare its discrete spectrum to that of the equation kink on equation.

The unpleasant infinite propagation of disturbances predicted by (CIT) lead to the development of the extended irreversible thermodynamics (EIT), a field that sprang out after an influential paper by Muller.

1905.13498,gr-qc,"An important probe of quantum geometry is its spectral dimension, defined via a spatial diffusion process. In this work we study the spectral dimension of a 'spatial hypersurface' in a manifoldlike causal set using the induced spatial distance function. In previous work, the diffusion was taken on the full causal set, where the nearest neighbours are unbounded in number. The resulting super-diffusion leads to an increase in the spectral dimension at short diffusion times, in contrast to other approaches to quantum gravity. In the current work, by using a temporal localisation in the causal set, the number of nearest spatial neighbours is rendered finite. Using numerical simulations of causal sets obtained from equation Minkowski spacetime, we find that for a flat spatial hypersurface, the spectral dimension agrees with the Hausdorff dimension at intermediate scales, but shows clear indications of dimensional reduction at small scales, i.e., in the ultraviolet. The latter is a direct consequence of 'discrete asymptotic silence' at small scales in causal sets.",2019,[],4

For studying the GHSBH's quantization, instead of ordinary quasinormal modes (QNMs), the boxed QNMs (BQNMs) that are the characteristic resonance spectra of the confined scalar fields in the GHSBH geometry are computed. To this end, it is assumed that the GHSBH has a confining mirror placed in the vicinity of its event horizon.

1901.00446,gr-qc,"A consistent quantum theory of gravity has remained elusive ever since the emergence of General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory. Attempts to date have not yielded a candidate that is either free from problematic theoretical inconsistencies, falsifiable by experiment, or both.

In recent years a number of proposals have been made to address the quantum structure of spacetime, and in particular how geometry and locality can emerge as the Universe cools. Quantum Graphity is perhaps the best known of these, but still does not connect the emerged quantized spacetime to dynamics or gravity. In this paper we start from a quantized mesh as the pre-geometry of space time and identify that informationally and in a very natural sense, the natural laws of gravity and Newtonian dynamics emerge. The resultant equations of gravity have a Yukawa term that operates at cosmic scale (equation meters), and we use data from the Spitzer space telescope to investigate experimental agreement of the galactic rotation curves with encouraging results.

This procedure results in two models: one in the time-domain, and one in the Fourier domain, which makes use of the stationary phase approximation. We discuss the computational efficiency of these models, and find that the time-domain model is roughly twice as fast as a numerical quadrupole waveform. We compare the time-domain model to both numerical, leading post-Newtonian order, quadrupole waveforms and numerical relativity fly-by waveforms using the match statistic.

The approach does not rely on postulates of equilibrium irreversible thermodynamics but treats irreversible processes from the non-equilibrium point of view. Thus, each transfer process is characterized by a characteristic velocity of perturbation propagation in the non-equilibrium state, as well as by an intrinsic time/length scale of the dissipative dynamics. The resulting system of governing equations is formulated as a first-order system of hyperbolic equations with relaxation-type irreversible terms.

We demonstrate that this can be used to clearly identify whether precession was measured in an observation (by comparison with both current detections and simulated signals), and can immediately quantify the measurability of precession in a given signal, which currently requires computationally expensive parameter-estimation studies. equation has numerous potential applications to signal searches, source-property measurements, and population studies. We give one example: assuming one possible astrophysical spin distribution, we predict that precession has a one in equation chance of being observed in any detection.",2019,[],4
1903.10115,gr-qc,"In the conventional adiabatic regularization the vacuum ultraviolet divergences of a quantum field in curved spacetime are removed by subtracting the equation-mode of the stress tensor to the 4th-order. For a scalar field in de Sitter space, we find that the 4th-order regularized spectral energy density is negative. Moreover, the 2nd-order regularization for minimal coupling (equation) and the 0th-order regularization for conformal coupling (equation) yield a positive and UV-convergent spectral energy density and power spectrum. The regularized stress tensor in the vacuum is maximally symmetric and can drive inflation, while its equation-modes representing the primordial fluctuations are nonuniformly distributed. Conventional regularization of a Green's function in position space is generally plagued by a log IR divergence. Only in the massless case with equation or equation, we can directly regularize the Green's functions and obtain vanishing results that agree with the adiabatic regularization results. In this case, the regularized power spectrum and stress tensor are both zero, and no trace anomaly exists. To overcome the log IR divergence problem in the massive cases with equation and equation, we perform Fourier transformation of the regularized power spectra and obtain the regularized analytical Green's functions which are IR- and UV-convergent.",2019,[],4

1903.04467,gr-qc,"The detection of gravitational waves by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo provides an opportunity to test general relativity in a regime that is inaccessible to traditional astronomical observations and laboratory tests. We present four tests of the consistency of the data with binary black hole gravitational waveforms predicted by general relativity. One test subtracts the best-fit waveform from the data and checks the consistency of the residual with detector noise. The second test checks the consistency of the low- and high-frequency parts of the observed signals. The third test checks that phenomenological deviations introduced in the waveform model (including in the post-Newtonian coefficients) are consistent with zero. The fourth test constrains modifications to the propagation of gravitational waves due to a modified dispersion relation, including that from a massive graviton. We present results both for individual events and also results obtained by combining together particularly strong events from the first and second observing runs of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, as collected in the catalog GWTC-1. We do not find any inconsistency of the data with the predictions of general relativity and improve our previously presented combined constraints by factors of 1.1 to 2.5. In particular, we bound the mass of the graviton to be equation (equation credible level), an improvement of a factor of 1.6 over our previously presented results. Additionally, we check that the four gravitational-wave events published for the first time in GWTC-1 do not lead to stronger constraints on alternative polarizations than those published previously.",2019,[],4

The models are obtained by numerically solving the coupled system of the Einstein equations and the equations of ideal general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. The mathematical formulation and numerical aspects of our approach are similar to those reported in previous works modeling stationary self-gravitating perfect-fluid tori, but the inclusion of magnetic fields represents a new ingredient. Following previous studies of purely hydrodynamical configurations, we construct our models assuming Keplerian rotation in the disks and both spinning and spinless black holes. We focus on the case of a toroidal distribution of the magnetic field and build a large set of models corresponding to a wide range of values of the magnetisation parameter, starting with weakly magnetised disks and ending at configurations in which the magnetic pressure dominates over the thermal one. In all our models, the magnetic field affects the equilibrium structure of the torus mainly due to the magnetic pressure. In particular, an increasing contribution of the magnetic field shifts the location of the maximum of the rest-mass density towards inner regions of the disk. The total mass of the system and the angular momentum are affected by the magnetic field in a complex way, that depends on the black hole spin and the location of the inner radius of the disk.

This method is used to specify equivalence classes of null generators, whose representatives can be associated lightlike co-normals that are locally affine geodesic and thus locally orthogonal to embedded null hypersurfaces of spacetime. The main benefit of the proposed procedure is the fact that it is less geometrically restrictive than the traditional dual-null approaches to general relativity, but nevertheless allows for the conclusion that spacetimes can be foliated by suitable pairs of normalized null geodesic vector fields. This is demonstrated by the example of different black hole spacetimes, that is, by members of the Kerr-Newman family, according to which a said foliation and an associated equivalence class of null generators are explicitly constructed.",2019,[],4
1903.05695,gr-qc,"We explore the possibility of selecting a natural vacuum state for scalar and tensor gauge-invariant cosmological perturbations in the context of hybrid quantum cosmology, by identifying those variables for the description of the perturbations that display a dynamical behavior adapted to the evolution of the entire cosmology. We make use of a canonical formulation of the whole of the cosmological system in which the perturbative gauge-invariant degrees of freedom are identified as canonical variables. Introducing background-dependent linear canonical transformations on these perturbations and completing them for the entire system, we are able to characterize a generic collection of annihilation and creationlike variables that obey the dynamics dictated by a respective collection of Hamiltonians. We then impose that such Hamiltonians possess no self-interaction terms so that, in a Fock representation with normal ordering, they act diagonally on the basis of equation-particle states. This leads to a semilinear first-order partial differential equation with respect to the background for the coefficients that define the annihilation and creationlike variables for all Fourier modes, as well as to a very precise ultraviolet characterization of them. Such first-order equation contains, in the imaginary part of its complex solutions, the complicated second-order field equation that typically arises for the time-dependent frequency of the perturbations in the context of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. We check that the asymptotic knowledge acquired allows one to select the standard vacua in Minkowski and de Sitter spacetimes. Finally, we discuss the relation of our vacuum and the standard adiabatic vacua, and check that our asymptotic characterization of variables with a diagonal Hamiltonian displays the properties that would be desirable for an adiabatic state of infinite order.",2019,[],4

Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metrics can be obtained from this single 'mother' metric (M-metric), by projecting onto different space-homogeneous four-dimensional hypersurfaces. The expansion factor equation is used as time coordinate in order to get full control of the equation of state of the resulting projection. The embedding of a generic (equilibrium) mixture of matter, radiation and cosmological constant is given, modulo a quadrature, although some signature-dependent restrictions must be accounted for. In the 41 case, where the extra coordinate is spacelike, the condition ensuring that the projected hypersurface is of Lorentzian type is explicitly given. An example showing a smooth transition from an Euclidian to a Lorentzian 4D metric is provided. This dynamical signature change can be considered a classical counterpart of the Hartle-Hawking 'no-boundary' proposal. The resulting FRW model shows an initial singularity at a finite value of the expansion factor equation.

Furthermore, we check the second law of thermodynamics and the weak cosmic censorship conjecture in two phase spaces. In the normal phase space, the second law of thermodynamics and the weak cosmic censorship conjecture are satisfied in the usual and GUP deformed cases, and the minimal length effect makes the increase of entropy faster than the usual case. After the charge particle absorption, the extremal RN-AdS black hole becomes non-extremal. In the extended phase space, the black hole entropy can either increase or decrease. When equation, the second law is satisfied. When equation, the second law of thermodynamics is violated for the extremal or near-extremal black hole.

In the classical (nondegenerate) limit, the system undergoes a gravitational collapse at low energies equation and low temperatures equation. This is called ""gravothermal catastrophe"" in the microcanonical ensemble and ""isothermal collapse"" in the canonical ensemble. When quantum mechanics is taken into account and when the particle number is below the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit (equation), complete gravitational collapse is prevented by the Pauli exclusion principle. In that case, the Fermi gas undergoes a gravitational phase transition from a gaseous phase to a condensed phase. The condensed phase represents a compact object like a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a dark matter fermion ball. When equation, there can be a subsequent gravitational collapse below a lower critical energy equation or a lower critical temperature equation leading presumably to the formation of a black hole. The evolution of the system is different in the microcanonical and canonical ensembles. In the microcanonical ensemble, the system takes a ""core-halo"" structure. The core consists in a compact quantum object or a black hole while the hot halo is expelled at large distances. This is reminiscent of the red giant structure of low-mass stars or the implosion-explosion of massive stars (supernova).

Here, we introduce the effects of dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant equation, that drives the late-time acceleration of the Universe, into the Schrodinger-Newton approach. We then ask in which regime dark energy dominates both canonical quantum diffusion and gravitational self-attraction. It turns out that this happens for sufficiently delocalized objects with an arbitrary mass and that there exists a minimal delocalization width of about equation m. While extremely macroscopic from a quantum perspective, the value is in principle accessible to laboratories on Earth. Hence, we analyze, numerically, how the dynamics of an initially spherical Gaussian wave packet is modified in the presence of equation. A notable feature is the gravitational collapse of part of the wave packet, in the core region close to the center of mass, accompanied by the accelerated expansion of the more distant shell surrounding it. The order of magnitude of the distance separating collapse from expansion matches analytical estimates of the classical turnaround radius for a spherically symmetric body in the presence of dark energy.

After truncating the action at the lowest nontrivial order in perturbations, one must define canonical variables for the matter content, for which one generally employs canonical transformations that mix the homogeneous background and the perturbations. Each of these possible definitions comes associated with a different matter contribution to the Hamiltonian of the complete system, that may, in general, contain terms that are quadratic in creationlike variables, and in annihilationlike variables, with the subsequent production and destruction of pairs of fermionic particles and antiparticles.

1907.12453,gr-qc,"The ""Shapiro delay"" experienced by an astronomical messenger traveling through a gravitational field has been used to place constraints on possible deviations from the equivalence principle. The standard Shapiro delay used to obtain these constraints is not itself an observable in general relativity, but is rather obtained by comparing with a fiducial Euclidean distance. There is not a mapping between the constraints obtained in this manner and alternative theories that exhibit equivalence principle violations. However, even assuming that the comparison with the fiducial Euclidean distance is carried out in a way that is useful for some class of alternative theories, we show that the standard calculation of these constraints cannot be applied on cosmological scales, as is often done. Specifically, we find that the Shapiro delay computed in the standard way (taking the Newtonian potential to vanish at infinity) diverges as one includes many remote sources. We use an infinite homogeneous lattice model to illustrate this divergence, and also show how the divergence can be cured by using Fermi coordinates associated with an observer. With this correction, one finds that the Shapiro delay is no longer monotonic with the number of sources. Thus, one cannot compute a conservative lower bound on the Shapiro delay using a subset of the sources of the gravitational field without further assumptions and/or observational input. As an illustration, we compute the Shapiro delay by applying the Fermi coordinate expression to two catalogs of galaxy clusters, illustrating the dependence of the result on the completeness of the catalogue and the mass estimates.",2019,[],4

We show that vector-dependent disformal couplings can be obtained in various different ways, each leading to spontaneous vectorization as indicated by the instabilities in linearized equations of motion. However, we also show that spontaneous growth is not evident beyond vectors. For example, we could not identify a spontaneous growth mechanism for a spinor field through disformal transformations, even though there is a known example for conformal transformations.

1910.00469,gr-qc,"In this thesis we consider the problem of dynamics in canonical loop quantum gravity, primarily in the context of deparametrized models, in which a scalar field is taken as a physical time variable for the dynamics of the gravitational field. The dynamics of the quantum states of the gravitational field is then generated directly by a physical Hamiltonian operator, instead of being implicitly defined through the kernel of a Hamiltonian constraint.   We introduce a new construction of a Hamiltonian operator for loop quantum gravity, which has both mathematical and practical advantages in comparison to earlier proposals. Most importantly, the new Hamiltonian can be constructed as a symmetric operator, and is therefore a mathematically consistent candidate for a generator of physical time evolution in deparametrized models. We develop methods for approximately evaluating the dynamics generated by a given physical Hamiltonian, even if an exact solution to the eigenvalue problem of the Hamiltonian cannot be achieved. We also introduce a new representation for intertwiners in loop quantum gravity, based on projecting intertwiners onto coherent states of angular momentum, and in which intertwiners are represented as polynomials of certain complex variables, and operators in loop quantum gravity are expressed as differential operators acting on these variables.   In addition to reviewing the results of the author's scientific work, this thesis also gives a thorough introduction to the basic framework of canonical loop quantum gravity, and a self-contained presentation of the graphical formalism for SU(2) recoupling theory, which is the invaluable tool for performing practical calculations in loop quantum gravity.

1907.04892,gr-qc,"Whereas the nature of dark components in the Universe remains unknown, alternative models of gravity have been developed to offer a geometric explanation to the origin of such components. In this work we use the Minimal Geometric Deformation approach to study extensions of the theory of General Relativity in a cosmological context. This is possible since such approach allows the decoupling of gravitational sources, and the Einstein field equations can be analytically solved with the presence of a new gravitational sector once a known GR solution is considered. In particular, we implement such approach in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker and Kantowski-Sachs universes. We demonstrate that the gravitational decoupling leads to modifications of well known cosmological solutions. For instance, we show that an effective spatial curvature in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, as well as several kind of matter components in the Kantowski-Sachs case, are obtained. Thus, we found that it is possible to obtain spatial curvature and new matter terms from geometry, which in cosmology they could be useful in addressing problems such as the spatial flatness of the Universe, dark matter and dark energy.",2019,[],4

The dominant contribution to this quantity is represented by a series of the moments of the generating functional of correlation functions of the system. Positive and negative effective coupling constants appear in these integer moments. Fluctuations in the Hawking temperature are able to generate first-order phase transitions.

This is just an initial condition: only the scale factor asymptotic behavior at the very moment of the big bang matters. The causal connection between remote space regions could then take place immediately after the big bang. Even equation seconds of proper time, would allow for an infinite number of light crossing times between any two space regions, no matter how far apart.

For a large graviton mass, the modifications to the waveform, compared to the one from general relativity, are negligible on the relevant distance scales and hence a conformal gravity model with a large graviton mass is in agreement with LIGO/VIRGO observations and leads to chirp mass and distance estimates that agree with those from general relativity.",2019,[],4
1908.05756,gr-qc,"In the loop quantum gravity context, there have been numerous proposals to quantize the reduced phase space of a black hole, and develop a classical effective description for its interior which eventually resolves the singularity. However, little progress has been made towards understanding the relation between such quantum/effective minisuperspace models and what would be the spherically symmetric sector of loop quantum gravity. In particular, it is not clear whether one can extract the phenomenological predictions obtained in minisuperspace models, such as the singularity resolution and the spacetime continuation beyond the singularity, based on results in full loop quantum gravity. In this paper, we present an attempt in this direction in the context of Kantowski-Sachs spacetime, through the proposal of two new effective Hamiltonians for the reduced classical model. The first is derived using Thiemann classical identities for the regularized expressions, while the second is obtained as a first approximation of the expectation value of a Hamiltonian operator in loop quantum gravity in a semi-classical state peaked on the Kantowski-Sachs initial data. We then proceed with a detailed analysis of the dynamics they generate and compare them with the Hamiltonian derived in General Relativity and the common effective Hamiltonian proposed in earlier literature.",2019,[],4

1908.07089,gr-qc,"Recent gravitational wave observations have allowed stringent new constraints on modifications to General Relativity (GR) in the extreme gravity regime. Although these observations were consistent with compact binaries with no orbital eccentricity, gravitational waves emitted in mildly eccentric binaries may be observed once detectors reach their design sensitivity. In this paper, we study the effect of eccentricity in gravitational wave constraints of modified gravity, focusing on Jordan-Brans- Dicke-Fierz theory as an example. Using the stationary phase approximation and the post-circular approximation (an expansion in small eccentricity), we first construct an analytical expression for frequency-domain gravitational waveforms produced by inspiraling compact binaries with small eccentricity in this theory. We then calculate the overlap between our approximate analytical waveforms and an eccentric numerical model (TaylorT4) to determine the regime of validity (in eccentricity) of the former. With this at hand, we carry out a Fisher analysis to determine the accuracy to which Jordan-Brans-Dicke-Fierz theory could be constrained given future eccentric detections consistent with General Relativity. We find that the constraint on the theory initially deteriorates (due to covariances between the eccentricity and the Brans-Dicke coupling parameter), but then it begins to recover, once the eccentricity is larger than approximately 0.03. We also find that third-generation ground-based detectors and space-based detectors could allow for constraints that are up to an order of magnitude more stringent than current Solar System bounds. Our results suggest that waveforms in modified gravity for systems with moderate eccentricity should be developed to maximize the theoretical physics that can be extracted in the future.",2019,[],4

These events provide unprecedented opportunities for testing the predictions of general relativity for the gravitational waveforms from these highly dynamical, strong-field events. The first two tests check the consistency of the residuals with noise and the consistency of the low- and high-frequency parts of the signal. The other two tests check that parameterized deviations in the waveform model---including in the post-Newtonian coefficients---are consistent with zero, and that the propagation of the waves is nondispersive. These tests reveal no evidence for deviations from general relativity, and the combined constraints improve previous results by factors of up to 2.5.

1911.10902,gr-qc,"Detections of gravitational wave (GW) stimulate the discussion of how GWs propagate in the expanding Universe. General relativity predicts that GWs are massless and propagate at the speed of light with no extra friction term, which relates to the attenuation of GWs, while some modified gravities may predict a different behavior. The mass and speed terms can be tightly constrained by the GW150914-like and GW170817/GRB 170817A events, respectively. However, the friction term remaining unconstrained. In this paper, we quantize the nonstandard propagating gravitational waves with nonzero friction term in the cosmological background, and study the influence of the friction term on the GW luminosity distance in quantum level, and the initial conditions of perturbations given by inflation. We find the quantum nature of the difference between GW and electromagnetic luminosity distance is graviton particle number non-conservation. For the initial conditions, we obtain an analytical expression of the power spectrum with nonzero friction term for the de Sitter background. In observations, both the GW luminosity distance and primordial GWs can be used to constrain the friction term.",2019,[],4

The new larger family of theories conserves the appeal of the DEF theory in terms of conforming to weak-field tests and also providing large signals in strong gravity. Moreover, they provide a much richer phenomenology including spontaneous tensorization of black holes as in ESTGB.

1912.02459,gr-qc,"Effective models of black holes interior have led to several proposals for regular black holes. In the so-called polymer models, based on effective deformations of the phase space of spherically symmetric general relativity in vacuum, one considers a deformed Hamiltonian constraint while keeping a non-deformed vectorial constraint. In this article, we revisit and study further the question of covariance in these deformed gravity models. In particular, we propose a Lagrangian formulation for these deformed gravity models where polymer-like deformations are introduced at the level of the full theory prior to the symmetry reduction and prior to the Legendre transformation. This enables us to test whether the concept of deformed covariance found in spherically symmetric vacuum gravity can be extended to the full theory, and we show that, in the large class of models we are considering, the deformed covariance can not be realized beyond spherical symmetry in the sense that the only deformed theory which leads to a closed constraints algebra is general relativity. Hence, we focus on the spherically symmetric sector, where there exist non-trivial deformed but closed constraints algebras. We investigate the possibility to deform the vectorial constraint as well and we prove that non-trivial deformations of the vectorial constraint with the condition that the constraints algebra remains closed do not exist. Then, we compute the most general deformed Hamiltonian constraint which admits a closed constraints algebra and thus leads to a well-defined effective theory associated with a notion of deformed covariance. Finally, we study homogeneous solutions of these effective theories and, remarkably, we solve explicitly and in full generality the corresponding modified Einstein equations, even for the effective theories which do not satisfy the closeness condition.",2019,[],4

From the point of view of the equation-bundle structure, the equation couples a equation-connection, a metric tensor defined on the base manifold and the surface gravity in a very nontrivial way. We focus on the equation-bundles over equation-dimensional manifolds diffeomorphic to equation-sphere. We have derived all the axisymmetric solutions to the Petrov type D equation. For a fixed value of the cosmological constant they set a equation-dimensional family as one could expect. A surprising result is, that generically our horizons are not embeddable in the known exact solutions to Einstein's equations. It means that among the exact type D spacetimes there exists a new family of spacetimes that generalize the properties of the Kerr- (anti) de Sitter black holes on one hand and the Taub-NUT spacetimes on the other hand.",2019,[],4
1910.01346,gr-qc,"We study the relation between the Fock representations for a Dirac field given by the adiabatic scheme and the unique family of vacua with a unitarily implementable quantum evolution that is employed in hybrid quantum cosmology. This is done in the context of a perturbed flat cosmology that, in addition, is minimally coupled to fermionic perturbations. In our description, we use a canonical formulation for the entire system, formed by the underlying cosmological spacetime and all its perturbations. After introducing an adiabatic scheme that was originally developed in the context of quantum field theory in fixed cosmological backgrounds, we find that all adiabatic states belong to the unitary equivalence class of Fock representations that allow a unitarily implementable quantum evolution. In particular, this unitarity of the dynamics ensures that the vacua defined with adiabatic initial conditions at different times are unitarily equivalent. We also find that, for all adiabatic orders other than zero, these initial conditions allow the definition of annihilation and creation operators for the Dirac field that lead to some finite backreaction in the quantum Hamiltonian constraint and to a fermionic Hamiltonian operator that is properly defined in the span of the \textitn-particle/antiparticle states, in the context of hybrid quantum cosmology.",2019,[],4

Since in this case the diagonal components of the energy-momentum tensor differ, the evolution of the corresponding universe also differs. For example, while a linear spinor field with non-minimal coupling or nonlinear spinor field with minimal coupling give rise to open universe, a nonlinear spinor field with non-minimal coupling with the same parameters can generate close universe that at the beginning expands, and after attaining some maximum value begin to contract and finally ends in a Big Crunch.",2019,[],4

We show that the thermodynamical requirement of identifying D-bound and Bekenstein bound for any system can be considered as a thermodynamical criterion using which one can prefer the cosmological constant as the viable dark energy and rule out the quintessence and phantom fields, as non viable dark energy fields. We show that, for the phantom field the D-bound and Bekenstein bound, as an entropy criterion, are identified only at the early times whereas for the quintessence background, this identification is realized only for late times. For cosmological constant, however, the D-bound and Bekenstein bound are identified for all times and this singles out the cosmological constant as the viable dark energy candidate. Moreover, when the local matter system in the McVittie spacetime is a black hole which possesses the saturated entropy, the entropy-area law and holographic principle put two constraints on the radius equation of the cosmological horizon. The first one shows that the Hubble radius is discrete such that for any arbitrary value of the black hole mass equation, the value of equation is determined up to an integer number.

The reconstructed EoS of dark energy has large uncertainty due to its dependence on the second order derivative of the construction. Adding the direct measurements of Hubble parameters equation as an additional constraint on the first order derivative can partially reduce the uncertainty, but is still not precise enough to distinguish between evolving and constant dark energy. Besides, the results heavily rely on the prior of Hubble constant equation. The equation value inferred from SNeequation without prior is equation.

The time dependent Vaidya metric which represents the spacetime of a radiating body like star is studied in an energy dependent gravity's rainbow, which is a UV completion of General Relativity. In our quest we have used gravitational collapse as the main tool. The focus is to probe the nature of singularity (black hole or naked singularity) formed out of the collapsing procedure. This is achieved via a geodesic study. For our investigation we have considered two different models of equation gravity, namely the inflationary Starobinsky's model and the power law model. Our study reveals the fact that naked singularity is as good a possibility as black hole as far as the central singularity is concerned. Via a proper fine tuning of the initial data, we may realize both black hole or naked singularity as the end state of the collapse. Thus this study is extremely important and relevant in the light of the Cosmic Censorship hypothesis. The most important result derived from the study is that gravity's rainbow increases the tendency of formation of naked singularities.

1909.10949,gr-qc,"In this work, we investigate the correspondence between the Erez-Rosen and Hartle-Thorne solutions. We explicitly show how to establish the relationship and find the coordinate transformations between the two metrics. For this purpose the two metrics must have the same approximation and describe the gravitational field of static objects. Since both the Erez-Rosen and the Hartle-Thorne solutions are particular solutions of a more general solution, the Zipoy-Voorhees transformation is applied to the exact Erez-Rosen metric in order to obtain a generalized solution in terms of the Zipoy-Voorhees parameter equation. The Geroch-Hansen multipole moments of the generalized Erez-Rosen metric are calculated to find the definition of the total mass and quadrupole moment in terms of the mass equation, quadrupole equation and Zipoy-Voorhees equation parameters. The coordinate transformations between the metrics are found in the approximation of equationq. It is shown that the Zipoy-Voorhees parameter is equal to equation with equation. This result is in agreement with previous results in the literature.",2019,[],4

We model the halo as a Bose--Einstein condensate in terms of a massive scalar field that satisfies a Klein--Gordon equation with a self--interaction term. We also assume that the bosonic cloud is not self--gravitating. To model the halo, we apply a simple form of the Thomas--Fermi approximation that allows us to extract relevant results with a simple and concise procedure. Using galaxy data from a subsample of SPARC data base, we find the best fits of the BEC model by using the Thomas--Fermi approximation and perform a Bayesian statistics analysis to compare the obtained BEC's scenarios with the Navarro--Frenk--White (NFW) model as pivot model. We find that in the centre of galaxies we must have a supermassive compact central object, i.e., supermassive black hole, in the range of equation which condensate a boson cloud with average particle mass equation eV and a self--interaction coupling constant equation, i.e., the system behaves as a weakly interacting BEC. We compare the BEC model with NFW concluding that in general the BEC model using the Thomas--Fermi approximation is strong enough compared with the NFW fittings.

1910.07812,gr-qc,"We consider the metrics of the General Relativity, whose energy-momentum tensor has a bounded support where it is continuous except for a finite step across the corresponding boundary surface. As a consequence, the first derivative of the metric across this boundary could perhaps present a finite step too. However, we can assume that the metric is equation class everywhere. In such a case, although the partial second derivatives of the metric exhibit finite (no Dirac equation functions) discontinuities, the Dirac equation functions will still appear in the conservation equation of the energy-momentum tensor. As a consequence, strictly speaking, the corresponding metric solutions of the Einstein field equations can only exist in the sense of distributions. Then, we assume that the metric considered is equation class everywhere and is a solution of the Einstein field equations in this sense. We explore the consequences of these two assumptions, and in doing so we derive the general conditions that constrain the jumps in the second partial derivatives across the boundary. The example of the Oppenheimer-Snyder metric is considered and some new results are obtained on it. Then, the formalism developed in this exploration is applied to a different situation, i.e., to a given generalization of the Einstein field equations for the case where the partial second derivatives of the metric exist but are not symmetric.",2019,[],4
1909.13052,gr-qc,"Recent trend of research indicates that not only massive but also massless (asymptotic Newtonian mass zero) wormholes can reproduce post-merger initial ring-down gravitational waves characteristic of black hole horizon. In the massless case, it is the non-zero charge of other fields, equivalent to what we call here the ""Wheelerian mass"", that is responsible for mimicking ring-down quasi-normal modes. In this paper, we enquire whether the same Wheelerian mass can reproduce black hole observables also in an altogether different experiment, viz., the strong field lensing. We examine two classes of massless wormholes, one in the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theory and the other in the Einstein-Minimally-coupled-Scalar field (EMS) theory. The observables such as the radius of the shadow, image separation and magnification of the corresponding Wheelerian masses are compared with those of a black hole (idealized SgrA* chosen for illustration) assuming that the three types of lenses share the same minimum impact parameter and distance from the observer. It turns out that, while the massless EMS\ wormholes can closely mimic the black hole in terms of strong field lensing observables, the EMD wormholes show considerable differences due to the presence of dilatonic charge. The conclusion is that masslessless alone is enough to closely mimic Schwarzschild black hole strong lensing observables in the EMS theory but not in the other, where extra parameters also influence those observables.

We then further trace out the gapped modes to give an effective purely phononic theory using closed-time-path formalism. In particular, we are interested in the sound cone fluctuations due to the variation of the speed-of-sound acoustic metric, induced by quantum fluctuations of the gapped modes. These fluctuations can be interpreted as inducing a stochastic space-time, and thus are regarded as analogue phenomena of light cone fluctuations presumably arising from quantum gravity effects. The effects of fluctuations can be displayed in the variation in the travel time of sound waves.

An investigation of gravitational time delay in the context of metric f(R) is also presented showing that the Ricci scalar alone is responsible for the time delay effect which seems to suggest that the extra scalar degree of freedom associated to f(R) does not provide any modification. Also, to generalise our results, the Lorentz force law and gravitational time delay in the case of Brans-Dicke theories with a potential are derived; it is shown that the results are consistent with those obtained in the case of metric f(R) and General Relativity in the appropriate limits.",2019,[],4
1909.10882,gr-qc,"We present a physically plausible solution representing Einstein's cluster mimicking the behaviors of compact star in the context of teleparallel equivalent of general relativity. The Teleparallel gravity (TEGR) is an alternative formulation of gravity which uses tetrads as the dynamical variables. We focus on two particularly interesting scenarios. First, we develop the Einstein clusters in TEGR field equations using effective energy-momentum tensor for diagonal as well as off-diagonal tetrad. We then study the clusters in modified equationgravity for anisotropic fluid distribution. Based on these two theories, we further study the solution without net electric charge and then for charged solution. For charge parameter equation, the charged solution reduces to neutral one. Our calculations show that when charge increases, the stiffness of the EoS also increases. This is due to increase in adiabatic index and sound speed approaching speed of light. When the charge increase beyond a certain limit (equation and equation), the compactness parameter crosses the Buchdahl limit i.e. equation and the solution start violating the causality condition. We test the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit for such compact objects. We analyze the static stability criterion of the Einstein clusters for both charged and uncharged case, and the stability of such compact objects is enhanced by the presence some net electric charge. Finally, we compare our solution for pure general relativity. As a result, we concluded that the Einstein cluster solution do exist in pure GR, however, physically unfit to mimic compact stars.

This differs from the behavior of Schwarzschild de Sitter geometry which evolves into a de Sitter space, the ground state of the space of solutions.

1912.05194,gr-qc,"In this paper, we study the weak gravitational deflection of relativistic massive particles for a receiver and source at finite distance from the lens in stationary, axisymmetric and asymptotically flat spacetimes. For this purpose, we extend the generalized optical metric method to the generalized Jacobi metric method by using the Jacobi-Maupertuis Randers-Finsler metric. More specifically,we apply the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to the generalized Jacobi metric space and then obtain an expression for calculating the deflection angle, which is related to Gaussian curvature of generalized optical metric and geodesic curvature of particles orbit. In particular, the finite-distance correction to the deflection angle of signal with general velocity in the the Kerr black hole and Teo wormhole spacetimes are considered. Our results cover the previous work of the deflection angle of light, as well as the deflection angle of massive particles in the limit for the receive and source at infinite distance from the lens object. In Kerr black hole spacetime, we compared the effects due to the black hole spin, the finite-distance of source or receiver, and the relativistic velocity in microlensings and lensing by galaxies. It is found in these cases, the effect of BH spin is usually a few orders larger than that of the finite-distance and relativistic velocity, while the relative size of the latter two could vary according to the particle velocity, source or observer distance and other lensing parameters.",2019,[],4

The approach draws from topological as well as dynamical system consideration, generating as a byproduct an effective cosmological constant. General Relativity is recovered by canceling the torsion in a region containing the observable Universe, which boundary constraints the invariants, thus yielding the effective cosmological constant's form. As that form's denominator contains the total volume of the average black hole, calculated from a geometrical mean on the estimated black hole mass distribution and directly associated to the ratio of the total volume boundary of the space-time manifold and the dominant term in its Euler characteristic.

The latter is a Lorentz-violating gravitational theory consisting of General Relativity with a dynamical timelike 'aether' vector field, which selects a 'preferred time' direction at each spacetime event. The Einstein-aether action is quadratic in the aether, and thus yields second order field equations for the metric and the aether. However, the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem is not easy to prove away from the simple case of perturbations over flat space. This is particularly problematic because well-posedness is a necessary requirement to ensure stability of numerical evolutions of the initial value problem. Here, we employ a first-order formulation of Einstein-aether theory in terms of projections on a tetrad frame. We show that under suitable conditions on the coupling constants of the theory, the resulting evolution equations can be cast into strongly or even symmetric hyperbolic form, and therefore they define a well-posed Cauchy problem.",2019,[],4

However, in order to reproduce the current cosmic acceleration, at late times, a mechanism to exit this behavior is needed. In the present work we show that the quintessential inflation models could be an excellent candidate to exhibit the above behavior. However, the crucial point of quintessential inflation is that the initial conditions has to be taken during the inflation, and at the beginning of the radiation era, the scalar field does not belong to the basin of attraction of the scaling solution.

1904.13254,gr-qc,"An important property of the three-point functions generated in the early universe is the so-called consistency condition. According to the condition, in the squeezed limit wherein the wavenumber of one of the three modes (constituting the triangular configuration of wavevectors) is much smaller than the other two, the three-point functions can be completely expressed in terms of the two-point functions. It is found that, while the consistency condition is mostly satisfied by the primordial perturbations generated in the inflationary scenario, it is often violated in the bouncing models. The validity of the consistency condition in the context of inflation can be attributed to the fact that the amplitude of the scalar and tensor perturbations freeze on super-Hubble scales. Whereas, in the bouncing scenarios, the amplitude of the scalar and tensor perturbations often grow rapidly as one approaches the bounce, leading to a violation of the condition. In this work, with the help of a specific example involving the tensor perturbations, we explicitly show that suitable non-minimal couplings can restore the consistency condition even in the bouncing models.

We then turn to the 2-2-hole solutions appearing in a classical approximation of the gravity theory. We present a new solution that is sourced by a relativistic gas, where a benign timelike singularity is shrouded by a fireball. Calculating the standard entropy gives an area law, and the entropy of a 2-2-hole can exceed that of the same size black hole. Finally, an observational consequence of 2-2-holes takes the form of gravitational wave echoes that can be generated by a newly formed 2-2-hole after a 2-2-hole merger.

Then, we find that the Hubble parameter is seem to be a constant in a large region near its minimum, thus causing the acceleration of the universe. Therefore, the fine tuning problem also can be solved in this model. Meanwhile, the scale of extra dimensions is smaller than the observed scale but greater than the Planck length.

In the interior domain, we assume that pressure is equal to negative energy density which leads to the existence of repulsive force on the spherical shell. The intermediate shell consists of ultra-relativistic plasma and pressure which shows a direct relation with energy density and counterbalances the repulsive force applied by the interior domain.

In GR, there exists a two-parameter family of such exact SMP solutions to the Einstein equations, which are physically distinguishable from the well-studied one parameter family of vacuum Schwarzschild solutions related with Schwarzschild Black Holes (SBH). The obtained here SMP family of solutions is defined by positive bare mass equation and positive Kepler mass equation, or, alternatively, by the standard gravitational radius equation and mass ratio equation. The metrics of spacetime have an unavoidable jump at the place of a massive point particle. We also present a proper development of the theory of distribution defined by kernels with a finite jump which appear in the solution of SMP. The specific properties of these distributions are used for work with SMP. A series of physical properties of SMP solutions are derived and commented.

1907.13427,gr-qc,"Presented is a quantum gravity theory that is a quantum mechanical generalization of Einstein's vierbein field-based approach, where the classical metric tensor field is promoted to a quantum mechanical metric tensor field operator. The quantum gravity theory derives from quantum information dynamics intrinsic to quantized space, which is taken to be a tensor product space on a qubit array. Hence, the metric tensor field operator is expressed as a product of two frame 4-vectors, which are anticommuting operators and naturally represented by Dirac matrices. The quantum gravity theory reduces to an effective nonlinear theory for a superconductive Fermi condensate. The asymmetric part of the metric tensor field operator encodes a fermion's intrinsic spin and mass in the torsion of space. A lower bound on the Fermi condensate's pair mass is found and the pair's mass estimated.",2019,[],4
1911.02693,gr-qc,"Over the past year, a handful of new gravitational wave models have been developed to include multiple harmonic modes thereby enabling for the first time fully Bayesian inference studies including higher modes to be performed. Using one recently-developed numerical relativity surrogate model, NRHybSur3dq8, we investigate the importance of higher modes on parameter inference of coalescing massive binary black holes. We focus on examples relevant to the current three-detector network of observatories, with a detector-frame mass set to equation and with signal amplitude values that are consistent with plausible candidates for the next few observing runs. We show that for such systems the higher mode content will be important for interpreting coalescing binary black holes, reducing systematic bias, and computing properties of the remnant object. Even for comparable-mass binaries and at low signal amplitude, the omission of higher modes can influence posterior probability distributions. We discuss the impact of our results on source population inference and self-consistency tests of general relativity. Our work can be used to better understand asymmetric binary black hole merger events, such as GW190412. Higher modes are critical for such systems, and their omission usually produces substantial parameter biases.",2019,[],4

First, when the orbits are nearly circular and executing a small oscillation about the equatorial plane and second, a generic trajectory confined on the equatorial plane. While in the first case, all the three fundamental frequencies, namely, radial equation, angular equation, azimuthal equation can be commensurate with each others and give rise to the resonance phenomenon, the later is only accompanied with the resonance between equation and equation as we set equation.

1901.05648,gr-qc,"Our understanding of black holes changed drastically, when Stephen Hawking discovered their evaporation due to quantum mechanical processes. One core feature of this effect is both its similarity and simultaneous dissimilarity to classical black body radiation: A black hole's spectrum certainly looks like that of a black/grey body, yet the number of emitted particles per unit time differs greatly. However it is precisely this emission rate that determines whether the resulting radiation field behaves classically or non-classically. It has been known nearly since the effect's discovery that a black hole's radiation is in this sense non-classical. However, this has been an utterly underappreciated property. In order to give a more readily quantifiable picture of this, we introduced the easily evaluated and interpreted notion of ""sparsity"". Sadly, and much to relativists' chagrin, astrophysical black holes (and their evaporation) tend to be observationally elusive entities. Luckily, Hawking's derivation lends itself to reformulations that survive outside its astrophysical origin - only three things are needed: a universal speed limit, a notion of a horizon, and lastly a sprinkle of quantum dynamics on top. With these ingredients at hand, the last thirty-odd years have seen a lot of work to transfer Hawking radiation into the laboratory, using a range of physical models. A large part of this thesis is aimed at providing electromagnetic analogues to prepare an analysis of our notion of sparsity in these analogues. For this, we developed extensively a purely algebraic/kinematical analogy based on covariant meta-material electrodynamics, but also an analytic/dynamical analogy based on stratified refractive indices. After introducing these analogue space-time models, we explain why the notion of sparsity is much more subtle and difficult to come by than in the original, astrophysical setting.",2019,[],4

Thereafter, we consider the strange quark distribution inside the stellar system followed by the MIT bag model equation of state (EOS). To find out the stability and also the physical acceptability of the stellar configuration, we perform in detail some basic physical tests of the proposed model. The results of the testing show that the system is consistent with the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, Herrera cracking concept, different energy conditions and adiabatic index. One important result that we observe is that the anisotropic stress reaches to the maximum at the surface of the stellar configuration.

In particular, we show that the widespread Hilbert form of the Schwarzschild solution, which depends only on the Keplerian mass equation and describes Black Holes (BH), does not solve the Einstein equations with a massive point particle stress-energy tensor. Novel normal coordinates for the gravitational field and a new physical class of gauges are proposed, thus achieving a correct description of a point mass source in GR.

1904.10791,gr-qc,"Horndeski gravity is the most general scalar tensor theory, with a single scalar field, leading to second order field equations and after the GW170817 it has been severely constrained. In this paper, we study the analogue of Horndeski's theory in the teleparallel gravity framework were gravity is mediated through torsion instead of curvature. We show that, even though, many terms are the same as in the curvature case, we have much richer phenomenology in the teleparallel setting because of the nature of the torsion tensor. Moreover, Teleparallel Horndenski contains the standard Horndenski gravity as a subcase and also contains many modified Teleparallel theories considered in the past, such as equation gravity or Teleparallel Dark energy. Thus, due to the appearing of a new term in the Lagrangian, this theory can explain dark energy without a cosmological constant, may describe a crossing of the phantom barrier, explain inflation and also solve the tension for equation, making it a good candidate for a correct modified theory of gravity.",2019,[],4

This has been made possible by the fact that the modified gravitational theory considered in this work has an exact rotating black hole solution and that the corresponding quasi-normal modes can be calculated. With these, we obtain the possible constraint that can be placed on the parameter describing the deviation of this particular alternative theory from general relativity by using the detection of the ringdown signals from binary black holes's merger with future space-based gravitational wave detectors.",2019,[],4

1908.01036,gr-qc,"Analogue gravity can be used to reproduce the phenomenology of quantum field theory in curved spacetime and in particular phenomena such as cosmological particle creation and Hawking radiation. In black hole physics, taking into account the backreaction of such effects on the metric requires an extension to semiclassical gravity and leads to an apparent inconsistency in the theory: the black hole evaporation induces a breakdown of the unitary quantum evolution leading to the so called information loss problem. Here we show that analogue gravity can provide an interesting perspective on the resolution of this problem, albeit the backreaction in analogue systems is not described by semiclassical Einstein equations. In particular, by looking at the simpler problem of cosmological particle creation, we show, in the context of Bose--Einstein condensates analogue gravity, that the emerging analogue geometry and quasi-particles have correlations due to the quantum nature of the atomic degrees of freedom underlying the emergent spacetime. The quantum evolution is, of course, always unitary, but on the whole Hilbert space, which cannot be exactly factorised a posteriori in geometry and quasi-particle components. In analogy, in a black hole evaporation one should expect a continuous process creating correlations between the Hawking quanta and the microscopic quantum degrees of freedom of spacetime, implying so that only a full quantum gravity treatment would be able to resolve the information loss problem by proving the unitary evolution on the full Hilbert space.",2019,[],4

1912.10159,gr-qc,"The Earth's geoid is one of the most essential and fundamental concepts to provide a gravity field-related height reference in geodesy and associated sciences. To keep up with the ever-increasing experimental capabilities and to consistently interpret high-precision measurements without any doubt, a relativistic treatment of geodetic notions (including the geoid) within Einstein's theory of General Relativity is inevitable. Building on the theoretical construction of isochronometric surfaces and the so-called redshift potential for clock comparison, we define a relativistic gravity potential as a generalization of (post-)Newtonian notions. This potential exists in any stationary configuration with rigidly co-rotating observers, and it is the same as realized by local plumb lines. In a second step, we employ the gravity potential to define the relativistic geoid in direct analogy to the Newtonian understanding. In the respective limit, the framework allows to recover well-known (post-) Newtonian results. For a better illustration and proper interpretation of the general relativistic gravity potential and geoid, some particular examples are considered. Explicit results are derived for exact vacuum solutions to Einstein's field equation as well as a parametrized post-Newtonian model. Comparing the Earth's Newtonian geoid to its relativistic generalization is a very subtle problem, but of high interest. An isometric embedding into Euclidean three-dimensional space is an appropriate solution and allows a genuinely intrinsic comparison. With this method, the leading-order differences are determined, which are at the mm-level.",2019,[],4

1912.09343,gr-qc,"In this work we show how the criterion of asymptotic Hamiltonian diagonalization originated in hybrid quantum cosmology serves to pick out a unique vacuum for the Dirac field in de Sitter, in the context of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. This criterion is based on the dynamical definition of annihilation and creationlike variables for the fermionic field, which obey the linearized dynamics of a Hamiltonian that has been diagonalized in a way that is adapted to its local spatial structure. This leads to fermionic variables that possess a precise asymptotic expansion in the ultraviolet limit of large wavenumbers. We explicitly show that, when the cosmological background is fixed as a de Sitter solution, this expansion uniquely selects the choice of fermionic annihilation and creationlike variables for all spatial scales, and thus picks out a unique privileged Fock representation and vacuum state for the Dirac field in de Sitter. The explicit form of the basis of solutions to the Dirac equation associated with this vacuum is then computed.",2019,[],4
1908.01888,gr-qc,"The consequences of the vacuum polarization effect in magnetic fields around a Schwarzschild Black Hole on the motion of charged particles are investigated in this work. Using the weak electromagnetic field approximation, we discuss the non-minimal coupling between magnetic fields and gravity caused by the vacuum polarization and study the equations of motion for the case of a magnetic field configuration which asymptotically approaches a dipole magnetic field. It is shown that the presence of non-minimal coupling can significantly influence the motion of charged particles around Black Holes. In particular, the vacuum polarization effect, leading to strong amplification or suppression of the magnetic field strength around the event horizon (depending on the sign of the coupling parameter), can affect the scattering angle and minimal distance for the electrons moving in the gravitational field of the Black Hole as well as the dependence of these parameters on the asymptotic magnetic field strength, initial distance and the Black Hole mass. It is further demonstrated that the non-minimal coupling between gravity and astrophysical magnetic fields, caused by the vacuum polarization, can cause significant changes of the parameter space corresponding to bound trajectories around the Black Hole. In certain cases, the bounded or unbounded character of a trajectory is determined solely by the presence of non-minimal coupling and its strength. These effects could in principle be used as observational signatures of the vacuum polarization effect and also to constrain the value of the coupling parameter.",2019,[],4

This amounts to Spacetime Construction from prior assumptions about space and dynamics alone. The other alternatives, arising as cofactors' likewise strongly vanishing roots are, firstly, Galileo-Riemann Geometrostatics with Galilean Relativity's infinte propagation speed. Secondly, Strong Gravity with Carrollian Relativity 's zero propagation speed. If none of these vanish, constant mean curvature of the spatial slice is enforced, paralleling previous work on decouping GR's constraints and addressing its initial-value problem. Assuming just Temporal Relationalism, spatial 3-diffeomorphism Configurational Relationalism is enforced as an integrability as one of very few options. The alternatives here are, once again, Galileo-Riemann Geometrostatics and Strong Gravity, for which spatial 3-diffeomorphisms are thereby optional, and local volume preserving diffeomorphisms. Options are few in each case above due to Rigidity kicking in.   We furthermore demonstrate that such Rigidities are more generally Lie rather than specific to Dirac-type Algorithms.

Specifically equation, where equation is the Ricci scalar, equation the trace of the energy-momentum tensor and equation a dimensionless parameter. This choice of equation function modifies the matter sector only, including new ingredients to the physical parameters that characterize the model such as density, radial, and tangential pressure. Moreover, other important quantities are affected such as subliminal speeds of the pressure waves in both radial and transverse direction, observational parameters, for example, the surface redshift which is related with the total mass equation and the radius equation of the compact object.

We analyze all the physical and mathematical general requirements of the configuration taking equation and varying equation from equation to equation. It is shown by the graphical procedure that equation yields to a more compact object in comparison when equation (where equation corresponds to general relativity theory) and increases the value of the surface redshift.

In particular, the EMT structure with any spinor field nonlinearities turns out to be the same as that of the EMT of a minimally coupled scalar field with a self-interaction potential.

We study the stability and instability of such flows and prove that, when the initial data are well-prepared, any family of T2 areal flows is sequentially compact in a natural topology. In order to handle general initial data we propose a relaxed notion of T2 areal flows endowed with a corrector stress tensor (as we call it) which is a bounded measure generated by geometric oscillations and concentrations propagating at the speed of light.

For the quartic potential we derive an explicit, two-term generalised asymptotic solution in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions, with a scale set by inverse powers of the square root of the cosmic time.

1912.10448,gr-qc,"In cosmological perturbation theory it is convenient to use the scalar, vector, tensor (SVT) basis as defined according to how these components transform under 3-dimensional rotations. In attempting to solve the fluctuation equations that are automatically written in terms of gauge-invariant combinations of these components, the equations are taken to break up into separate SVT sectors, the decomposition theorem. Here, without needing to specify a gauge, we solve the fluctuation equations exactly for some standard cosmologies, to show that in general the various gauge-invariant combinations only separate at a higher-derivative level. To achieve separation at the level of the fluctuation equations themselves one has to assume boundary conditions for the higher-derivative equations. While asymptotic conditions suffice for fluctuations around a dS background or a equation RW background, for fluctuations around a equation RW background one additionally has to require that the fluctuations be well-behaved at the origin. We show that in certain cases the gauge-invariant combinations themselves involve both scalars and vectors. For such cases there is no decomposition theorem for the individual SVT components themselves, but for the gauge-invariant combinations there still can be. Given the lack of manifest covariance in defining a basis with respect to 3-dimensional rotations, we introduce an alternate SVT basis whose components are defined according to how they transform under 4-dimensional general coordinate transformations. With this basis the fluctuation equations greatly simplify, and while one can again break them up into separate gauge-invariant sectors at the higher-derivative level, in general we find that even with boundary conditions we do not obtain a decomposition theorem in which the fluctuations separate at the level of the fluctuation equations themselves.",2019,[],4

We use a parametrization for the metric proposed by Rezzolla and Zhidenko, as well as the the higher order WKB method in the determination of the quasi-normal mode spectra. We look for possible degeneracies in a tractable subset of the parameter space with respect to the Schwarzschild quasi-normal modes.

Many parameterizations of couplings between the two in the continuity equation have been studied in the literature, and observational data from the growth of perturbations can constrain these parameterizations. Dark matter and dark energy interact gravitationally, so they should at least be coupled via the graviton. Assuming standard general relativity with no explicit coupling between dark energy and dark matter fields in the Lagrangian, we use the Boltzmann transport equation to analytically calculate the gravitational interaction in the continuity equation and compare it to a typical parametrization. We arrive at a comparably very small result, as expected. Since the interaction is a function of the dark matter mass, observational data can be used to constrain it. This calculation can be modified to account for explicit couplings in the dark energy and dark matter fields. This calculation required obtaining a distribution function for dark energy that leads to an equation of state parameter that is negative, which neither Bose-Einstein nor Fermi-Dirac statistics can supply.

The parity violating solutions have non-vanishing Weyl curvature even within FRW models. The presence of parity violating torsion opens up the space of possible such theories with relevant FRW modifications: in particular the Pontryagin term can play an important role even in the absence of spinorial matter.

The strength of interactions within the cosmic fluid are shown to play a more important role in affecting the evolution of the event horizon, rather than of the cosmological horizon in the case of a singularity-free universe. While the cosmological horizon always exists during the time evolution, the event horizon can exist only when a certain relationship between the Hawking-Hayward quasi-local mass and the Hubble function is fulfilled. In this manner, we can study the role played by the large-scale physics (cosmic evolution) on the local scale physics (evolution of a black hole).",2019,[],4
1904.07191,gr-qc,"We compute the lowest frequency radial oscillation modes of boson stars. It is assumed that the object is made of pseudo-Goldstone bosons subjected to a scalar potential that leads to a repulsive self-interaction force, and which is characterized by two unknown mass scales equation (mass of the particle) and equation (decay constant). First we integrate the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for the hydrostatic equilibrium of the star, and then we solve the Sturm-Liouville boundary value problem for the perturbations using the shooting method. The effective potential that enters into the Schrodinger-like equation as well as several associated eigenfunctions are shown as well. Moreover, we found that the large frequency separation, i.e. the difference between consecutive modes, is proportional to the square root of the mass of the star and the cube of the mass scale defined by equation.",2019,[],4
1907.12083,gr-qc,"We analyze the Bianchi IX Universe in the Polymer Quantum Mechanics framework by facing both semiclassical and purely quantum effects near the cosmological singularity. We adopt Misner variables to describe the model dynamics, applying the polymer paradigm simultaneously to the isotropic one (linked to the Universe volume) and to the two anisotropy ones (characterizing the physical gravitational degrees of freedom). Setting two different cut-off scales for the two different variable sets, i.e. the geometrical volume and the gravity tensor modes, we demonstrate how the semiclassical properties of the Bianchi IX dynamics are sensitive to the ratio of the cut-off parameters. In particular, the semiclassical evolution turns out to be chaotic only if the parameter associated to the volume discretization is greater or equal to that one of the anisotropies. Concerning the chaotic case we perform a purely quantum polymer analysis, demonstrating that the original Misner result about the existence of quasi-classical states near the singularity (in the sense of high occupation numbers) is still valid in the revised approach and able to account for cut-off physics effects. The possibility for a comparison with the original study by Misner is possible because the singularity is still present in the semiclassical evolution of the cosmological model for all the parameter space. We interpret this surprising feature as the consequence of a geometrical volume discretization which does not prevent the volume from vanishing, i.e. restoring in the Minisuperspace analysis its zero value.",2019,[],4
1908.04754,gr-qc,"To find more deliberate equation astrophysical solutions, we proceed by studying wormhole geometries under the assumption of spherical symmetry and the existence of a conformal Killing symmetry to attain the more acceptable astrophysical results. To do this, we consider a more plausible and simple model equation, where equation is the Ricci scalar and equation denotes the trace of the energy-momentum tensor of the matter content. We explore and analyze two cases separately. In the first part, wormhole solutions are constructed for the matter sources with isotropic pressure. However, the obtained solution does not satisfy the required wormhole conditions. In the second part, we introduce an EoS relating with pressure (radial and lateral) and density. We constrain the models with phantom energy EoS i.e. equation, consequently violating the null energy condition. Next, we analyze the model via equation. Several physical properties and characteristics of these solutions are investigated which are consistent with previous references about wormholes. We mainly focus on energy conditions (NEC, WEC and SEC) and consequently for supporting the respective wormhole geometries in details. In both cases it is found that the energy density is positive as seen by any static observer. To support the theoretical results, we also plotted several figures for different parameter values of the model that helps us to confirm the predictions. Finally, the volume integral quantifier, which provides useful information about the total amount of exotic matter required to maintain a traversable wormhole is discussed briefly.",2019,[],4
1910.04565,gr-qc,"The higher-multipoles of gravitational wave signals from coalescing compact binaries play a vital role in the accurate reconstruction of source properties, bringing about a deeper and nuanced understanding of fundamental physics and astrophysics. Their effect is most pronounced in systems with asymmetric masses having an orbital geometry that is not face-on. The detection of higher-multipoles of GW signals from any single, isolated merger event is challenging, as there is much less power in comparison to the dominant quadrupole mode. In this Letter, we present a new method for their detection by combining multiple events observed in interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Sub-dominant modes present in (the inspiral part of) the signal from separate events are stacked using the time-frequency spectrogram of the data. We demonstrate that this procedure enhances the signal-to-noise ratio of the higher-multipole components and thereby leads to increased chances of their detection. From Monte-Carlo simulations, we estimate that a combination of equation events observed in two-detector coincidence can lead to the detection of the higher-multipole components with a equation detection probability. The advanced-LIGO detectors are expected to record these many binary black hole merger events within a month of operation at design sensitivity. We also present results from the analysis of data from O1 and O2 science runs containing previously detected events using our new method.",2019,[],4

The generic theory in this family contains higher order time derivative terms in the Jordan frame action which is indicative of ill-posedness. However, we show that equations of motion can always be reduced to a second-order-in-time form as long as the original Einstein frame formulation is well posed. The inverse transformation from the Jordan frame back to the Einstein frame is not possible for all field values in all theories, but we obtain a fully invertible transformation for vector-tensor theories by a redefinition of the vector field. Our main motivation is a better understanding of spontaneous scalarization and its generalizations, however our conclusions are applicable to a wide class of theories.

1907.07486,gr-qc,"Similar to the light, gravitational waves traveling in multiple paths may arrive at the same location if there is a gravitational lens on their way. Apart from the magnification of the amplitudes and the time delay between the gravitational wave rays, gravitational lensing also rotates their polarization planes. This results in the changes in the antenna pattern function, which describes the response of the detector to its relative orientation to the gravitational wave. These effects are all reflected in the strain, the signal registered by the interferometers. The gravitational wave rays in various directions stimulate different strains. Their strains differ from each other due to different magnification factors, the phases and the rotation of the polarization plane. The phase difference mainly comes from the time delay. Moreover, the rotation of the polarization plane seemingly introduces the \textitapparent vector polarizations, when these strains are compared with each other. Because of the smallness of the deflection angles, the effect of the rotation is negligible.",2019,[],4

We investigate the thermodynamics for equation-equation criticality and phase transition in the extended phase space of the AdS black holes by treating the cosmological constant as pressure and its conjugate quantity as thermodynamic volume. We complete the analogy of this system with the liquid-gas system and study its critical point, which occurs at the point of divergence of the specific heat at constant pressure equation, volume expansion coefficient equation and isothermal compressibility coefficient equation. Using these expressions we calculate the Ehrenfest equations and carry out an analytical check. These results resemble with the nature of liquid-gas phase transition at the critical point, and hence the understanding of the analogy of AdS black holes and liquid-gas systems perfectly matches with the van der Waals (vdWs) gas.",2019,[],4

We analyse the different choices of the expansion parameter, in order to include matter in the background equations in a clean way and without any need of manually rescaling the matter fields. We also discuss the problem of the non-unitary evolution at the order of the expansion where quantum gravity corrections to quantum field theory appear: we claim that the proposed solutions are non viable and that either the problem may need for new theoretical paradigms to be solved or one has to relax some of the fundamental hypotheses of the Semiclassical Approach, at least at the quantum gravity order.",2019,[],4

1906.08194,gr-qc,This is the third paper in a series of four in which we use space adiabatic methods in order to incorporate backreactions among the homogeneous and between the homogeneous and inhomogeneous degrees of freedom in quantum cosmological perturbation theory.   In this paper we consider a particular kind of cosmological perturbation theory which starts from a gauge fixed version of General Relativity. The gauge fixing is performed using a material reference system called Gaussian dust. The resulting system has no constraints any more but possesses a physical Hamiltonian that drives the dynamics of both geometry and matter. As observable matter content we restrict to a scalar field (inflaton). We then explore the sector of that theory which is purely homogeneous and isotropic with respect to the geometry degrees of freedom but contains inhomogeneous perturbations up to second order of the scalar field.   The purpose of this paper is to explore the quantum field theoretical challenges of the space adiabatic framework in a cosmological model of inflation which is technically still relatively simple. We compute the quantum backreaction effects from every energy band of the inhomogeneous matter modes on the evolution of the homogeneous geometry up to second order in the adiabatic parameter. These contributions turn out to be significant due to the infinite number of degrees of freedom and are very sensitive to the choice of Fock representation chosen for the inhomogeneous matter modes.,2019,[],4
1908.05707,gr-qc,"Binary-black-hole orbits precess when the black-hole spins are mis-aligned with the binary's orbital angular momentum. The apparently complicated dynamics can in most cases be described as simple precession of the orbital angular momentum about an approximately fixed total angular momentum. However, the imprint of the precession on the observed gravitational-wave signal is yet more complicated, with a non-trivial time-varying dependence on black-hole dynamics, the binary's orientation and the detector polarization. As a result, it is difficult to predict under which conditions precession effects are measurable in gravitational-wave observations, and their impact on both signal detection and source characterization. We show that the observed waveform can be simplified by decomposing it as a power series in a new precession parameter equation, where equation is the opening angle between the orbital and total angular momenta. The power series is made up of five harmonics, with frequencies that differ by the binary's precession frequency, and individually do not exhibit amplitude and phase modulations. In many cases, the waveform can be well approximated by the two leading harmonics. In this approximation we are able to obtain a simple picture of precession as caused by the beating of two waveforms of similar frequency. This enables us to identify regions of the parameter space where precession is likely to have an observable effect on the waveform, and to propose a new approach to searching for signals from precessing binaries, based upon the two-harmonic approximation.",2019,[],4

1904.06149,gr-qc,"The polymer quantization of cosmological backgrounds provides an alternative path to the original Wheeler-de Witt (WdW) quantum cosmology, based on a different representation the commutation relations of the canonical variables. This polymer representation allows to capture the lattice like structure of the quantum geometry and leads to a radically different quantum cosmology compared to the WdW construction. This new quantization scheme has attracted considerable attention due to the singularity resolution it allows in a wide class of symmetry reduced gravitational systems, in particular where the WdW scheme fails. However, as any canonical quantization scheme, ambiguities in the construction of the quantum theory, being regularization or factor-ordering ones, can drastically modify the resulting quantum dynamics. In this work, we propose a new criteria to restrict the quantization ambiguities in the simplest model of polymer quantum cosmology, for homogeneous and isotropic General Relativity minimally coupled to a massless scalar field. This new criteria is based on an underlying equation structure present in the phase space of this simple cosmological model. By preserving the symmetry of this cosmological system under this 1d conformal group, we derive a new regularization of the phase space. We perform both its polymer quantization and a quantization scheme directly providing a representation of the SLequation group action. The resulting quantum cosmology can be viewed as a lattice-like quantum mechanics with an SLequation invariance. This provides a new version of Loop Quantum Cosmology consistent with the conformal symmetry. This alternative construction opens new directions, among which a possible mapping with the conformal quantum mechanics as well as with recent matrix or tensor models constructions for quantum cosmological space-time.",2019,[],4

1906.06791,gr-qc,"If a small compact object orbits a black hole, it is known that it can excite the black hole's quasinormal modes (QNMs), leading to high-frequency oscillations (""wiggles"") in the radiated field at equation, and in the radiation-reaction self-force acting on the object after its orbit passes through periapsis. Here we survey the phenomenology of these wiggles across a range of black hole spins and equatorial orbits. In both the scalar-field and gravitational cases we find that wiggles are a generic feature across a wide range of parameter space, and that they are observable in field perturbations at fixed spatial positions, in the self-force, and in radiated fields at equation. For a given charge or mass of the small body, the QNM excitations have the highest amplitudes for systems with a highly spinning central black hole, a prograde orbit with high eccentricity, and an orbital periapsis close to the light ring. The QNM amplitudes depend smoothly on the orbital parameters, with only very small amplitude changes when the orbit's (discrete) frequency spectrum is tuned to match QNM frequencies. The association of wiggles with QNM excitations suggest that they represent a situation where the \emphnonlocal nature of the self-force is particularly apparent, with the wiggles arising as result of QNM excitation by the compact object near periapsis, and then encountered later in the orbit. Astrophysically, the effects of wiggles at equation might allow direct observation of Kerr QNMs in extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) binary black hole systems, potentially enabling new tests of general relativity.",2019,[],4

We expand on both of these properties. First we show that NLSM tree-level amplitudes are fully determined by imposing color-dual structure together with cyclic invariance and locality. We then consider how hard-scaling can be used to constrain the predictions of these theories, as opposed to the usual soft-scaling. We probe the UV by generalizing the familiar BCFW shift off-shell to a novel single hard limit. We show that UV scalings are sufficient to fully constrain: 1. Bi-adjoint doubly-ordered amplitudes, assuming locality; 2. NLSM and BI, assuming locality and unitarity; 3. Special Galileon, assuming locality, unitarity, and a UV bound for the general Galileon vertex. We see how potentially distinct aspects of this UV behavior can be understood and unified via double-copy relations. Surprisingly, we find evidence that assuming unitarity for these theories may not be necessary, and can emerge via UV considerations and locality alone.

It then follows from the infinite distance conjecture that there must be a tower of states in the infinite entropy limit, and that ignoring these towers on the horizon of the black hole would invalidate the effective theory when the entropy becomes large. We call this the black hole entropy distance conjecture. We then study two candidates for the tower of states. The first are the Kaluza-Klein modes of the internal geometry of extremal equation black holes in string theory, whose masses on the horizon are fixed by the equation attractor formalism, and given in terms of the black hole charges similarly to the entropy. However, we observe that it is possible to decouple their masses from the entropy, so that they cannot generically play the role of the tower. We thus consider a second kind of states: inspired by N-portrait quantum models of non-extremal black holes, we argue that the Goldstone-like modes that interpolate among the black hole microstates behave like the expected light tower of states.",2019,[],6

The equivalence of this construction with equation-extremization has been checked in various examples and holds also off-shell. In this note we prove that such equivalence holds for an arbitrary toric Calabi-Yau. We do it by generalizing the proof of the equivalence between equation-maximization and volume minimization for four-dimensional toric quivers. By an explicit parameterization of the R-charges we map the trial right-moving central charge equation into the off-shell functional to be extremized in gravity.

We develop PM bootstrap for equation theories and derive the necessary contact terms for such theories (which also involves a new higher gradient contact term absent for equation). We perform cross-checks which include considering the diagonal limit of the equation Ising model in terms of the equation PM blocks. As an independent check of the validity of the results obtained with PM bootstrap, we propose a suitable basis of transcendental functions, which allows to fix the four-point correlators of identical scalar primaries completely, up to a finite number of ambiguities related to the number of contact terms in the PM basis. We perform this analysis both at tree level (with and without exchanges) and at one loop. We also derive expressions for the corresponding CFT data in terms of harmonic sums.

In this paper we elaborate on the double copy that yields amplitudes in gravitational theories coupled to flavored massive matter with spin, which is relevant to the problems of black-hole scattering and gravitational waves. Our construction benefits from making the little group explicit for the massive particles, as shown on lower-point examples. For concreteness, we focus on the double copy of QCD with massive quarks, for which we work out the gravitational Lagrangian up to quartic scalar and vector-scalar couplings.

We analyze an older proposal by Gava and Narain where the lift can be computed in terms of a finite number of 3-point functions. A direct Hamiltonian decomposition of the path integral involves an infinite number of 3-point functions, as well the first order correction to the starting state. We note that these corrections to the state account for the infinite number of 3-point functions arising from higher energy states, and one can indeed express the path-integral result in terms of a finite number of 3-point functions involving only the leading order states that are degenerate.

We identify this foliation with the pattern of partial Higgs mechanism of the theory and, using brane systems and recently introduced notions of magnetic quivers and quiver subtraction, we formalise the rules to obtain the Hasse diagram which encodes the structure of the foliation. While the unbroken gauge symmetry and the number of flat directions are obtainable by classical field theory analysis for Lagrangian theories, our approach allows us to characterise the geometry of the Higgs branch by a Hasse diagram with symplectic leaves and transverse slices, thus refining the analysis and extending it to non-Lagrangian theories. Most of the Hasse diagrams we obtain extend beyond the cases of nilpotent orbit closures known in the mathematics literature. The geometric analysis developed in this paper is applied to Higgs branches of several Lagrangian gauge theories, Argyres-Douglas theories, five dimensional SQCD theories at the conformal fixed point, and six dimensional SCFTs.",2019,[],6

The main new tools which allow us to obtain such representations are various higher-point propagator identities, which can be interpreted as generalizations of the well-known flat space star-triangle identity, and which compute integrals over products of three bulk-to-bulk and/or bulk-to-boundary propagators in negatively curved spacetime. Using the holographic representation of the higher-point conformal blocks and higher-point propagator identities, we develop geodesic diagram techniques to obtain the explicit direct-channel conformal block decomposition of a broad class of higher-point AdS diagrams in a scalar effective bulk theory, with closed-form expressions for the decomposition coefficients. These methods require only certain elementary manipulations and no bulk integration, and furthermore provide quite trivially a simple algebraic origin of the logarithmic singularities of higher-point tree-level AdS diagrams.

More importantly, for some fixed ratio of two radii, it undergoes a phase transition or double phase transitions from a hemi-torus configuration to a two-disk configuration, or vice versa, during the thermalization. The occurrence of various phase transitions is determined by the ratio of two radii of the annulus. The rate of entanglement growth is also investigated during the thermal quench.

Novel ""dense core - diluted halo"" density profiles in the AdS bulk were found, with corresponding two-point scalar field correlators obtained within the world line formalism, as a probe of the dual field theory. In this work we cover a much broader free parameter-space of the fermionic solutions in the bulk (from dilute to highly degenerate regime including for the critical point of gravitational collapse), and study their thermodynamic stability by calculating the grand canonical potential and free entropy. Such a stability analysis is performed using the Katz criterion, a technique historically applied to study the gravothermal catastrophe proper of classical self-gravitating systems in flat space.

An infinite number of such operators contribute, but their sum is described by a simple ansatz. We show that the coefficients in this ansatz can be determined recursively, thereby providing an operational procedure to compute them. This is achieved by bootstrapping the corresponding near lightcone correlator: conformal data for any minimal-twist determines that for the higher minimal-twist and so on. To illustrate this procedure in four spacetime dimensions we determine the contributions of double- and triple-stress tensors. We compute the OPE coefficients; whenever results are available in the literature, we observe complete agreement. We also compute the contributions of double-stress tensors in six spacetime dimensions and determine the corresponding OPE coefficients.

1909.00434,hep-th,"The AdS/CFT correspondence is one of the most important discoveries in theoretical physics in recent years. It states that certain quantum mechanical theories can actually be described by classical gravity in one higher dimension, in a spacetime called anti-de Sitter (AdS) space.

During the course of my PhD I have mostly studied time dependent processes, in particular thermalization processes, in quantum field theories using the AdS/CFT correspondence. On the gravity side, this is dual to dynamical formation of black holes from the collapse of matter fields. By studying the gravitational collapse process in detail, we can then draw conclusions about the dynamical formation of a thermal state in the dual quantum field theory. Using mostly numerical methods, I have studied how confinement affects thermalization in quantum field theories, where the system may never thermalize and field theory observables undergo interesting quasiperiodic behaviour. I have also studied formation of black holes in three dimensions which due to the simplified nature of three-dimensional gravity can be done using analytical methods. This has led to the discovery of new solutions of three-dimensional gravity corresponding to the formation of black holes without spherical symmetry, which can provide a deeper understanding of thermalization in two-dimensional quantum field theories.

When the operators of dimension equation and equation are in the same multiplet there are contributions due to the exchange of single-trace operators in the equation and equation channels, which are not captured by the approach mentioned above. However by rewriting the equation-channel results in Mellin space we obtain a compact expression for the equation-channel contribution that makes it possible to conjecture a formula for the complete result.

1906.08292,hep-th,"In this paper we study a quench protocol on thermofield double states in the presence of time-reversal symmetry that is inspired by the work of Gao, Jafferis and Wall.   The deformation is a product of hermitian operators on the left and right systems that are identical to each other and that lasts for a small amount of time.   We study the linear dependence on the quench to the properties of the deformation under time reversal. If the quench is time symmetric, then the linear response after the quench of all T-even operators vanishes. This includes the response of the energy on the left system and all the thermodynamic expectation values (the time averaged expectation values of the operators). Also, we show under an assumption of non-degeneracy of the Hamiltonian that the entanglement entropy between left and right is not affected to this order. We also study a variation of the quench where an instantaneous deformation is given by an operator of fixed T-parity and it's time derivative. It is shown that the sign of the response of the Hamiltonian is correlated with the T-parity of the operator. We can then choose the sign of the amplitude of the quench to result in a reduction in the energy. This implies a reduction of the entanglement entropy between both sides.",2019,[],6

Moreover, the apparent relationship between two heterotic compactifications seen in (0,2) heterotic target space dual pairs should, in principle, induce some putative correspondence between the dual F-theory geometries. It has previously been conjectured in the literature that (0,2) target space duality might manifest in F-theory as multiple K3-fibrations of the same elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau manifold. In this work we investigate this conjecture in the context of both 6-dimensional and 4-dimensional effective theories and demonstrate that in general, (0,2) target space duality cannot be explained by such a simple phenomenon alone.

We do this by showing that, starting from a background with no NSNS-flux, the deformed background solves the equation-corrected supergravity equations to second order in the deformation parameter. At the same time we determine the required equation-corrections of the deformed background, which take a relatively simple form. In examples that can be constructed using, possibly non-commuting sequences of, TsT transformations we show how to obtain the first equation-correction to all orders in the deformation parameter by making use of the equation-corrected T-duality rules.

Based on this expression we develop a very efficient method of computing the partition function in the genus expansion as well as in the low temperature expansion by making use of the Korteweg-de Vries constraints obeyed by the partition function. We have computed both these expansions up to very high orders using this method. It turns out that we can take a low temperature limit with the ratio of the temperature and the genus counting parameter held fixed.

The hyperbolic models considered here tend to the polynomial equation and equation models in the limit of small values of the scalar field. We show that kinks and antikinks that interact hyperbolically with fourth order differ sensibly from those governed by the polynomial equation model. The increasing of the order of interaction to the sixth order shows that the hyperbolic and polynomial models give intricate structures of scattering that differ only slightly. The dependence on the order of interaction are related to some characteristics of the models such as the potential of perturbations and the number of vibrational modes.,2019,[],6

1911.00129,hep-th,"It has been suggested that a certain class of UV-incomplete quantum field theories can avoid unitarity violation above the cut-off energy scale by forming classical configurations at a length scale much larger than the cut-off length. This phenomenon has been named classicalization and is characterized by a length scale called classicalization radius equation which increases with energy. It has been argued that scalar field theories with derivative self-interactions are likely candidate for UV-completetion by classicalization and are much likely to form classicalons compared to non-classicalizing theories like equation scalar field theory. To look further into this claim, in this paper 2 to N particle scattering amplitude, scattering cross-section and the amplitude of classical structure formation has been calculated and compared for a classicalizing and non-classicalizing theory. As the phenomenon of classicalization relies on creating a large number of low energy particles from high energy two particle scattering, the ratios between the scattering amplitudes and the amplitude of classical structure formation in these two cases are an indicator of the feasibility of the classicalization process. From our calculation, it has been observed that with the increase of energy, the ratios of the relevant quantities between classicalizing and non-classicalizing theory actually decrease which is quite contrary to the expected behaviour if classicalization is supposed to self-unitarize certain class of theories beyond cut-off energy.",2019,[],6
1911.11574,hep-th,"Large equation matrix models play an important role in modern theoretical physics, ranging from quantum chromodynamics to string theory and holography. However, they remain a difficult technical challenge because in most cases it is not known how to perform the sum over planar graphs, which dominate the models at large equation. In this thesis, we study large equation matrix models, which provide a framework to build new limits for matrix models in which the sum over planar graphs simplifies when equation is large. The basic degrees of freedom are real matrices of size equation with equation additional indices of range equation. They can be interpreted as a real tensor of rank equation with indices of different ranges, making a compelling connection with tensor models. We define a new large equation limit for the sum over Feynman graphs of fixed genus in matrix models, based on an enhanced large equation scaling of the coupling constants. Then, we show that the resulting large equation expansion is well-defined and organized according to a half-integer called the index. When equation, the result provides a new large equation limit for general equation invariant tensor models. In the large equation limit, the sum over planar graphs of large equation matrix models simplifies to a non-trivial sum over generalized melonic graphs. This class of graphs extends the one obtained in tensor models with standard scaling and allows for a wider class of interactions, including all the maximally single-trace terms. The general classification of generalized melonic graphs remains an open problem.

At a point in moduli space which is a minimum of the scalar potential, the type II compactification becomes an asymmetric Gepner model and the monodromies become automorphisms involving mirror symmetries, while the heterotic dual is an asymmetric toroidal orbifold. We generalise previous constructions to ones in which the automorphisms are not of prime order.

1909.05262,hep-th,"We study three dimensional equation supersymmetric abelian gauge theories with various matter contents living on a squashed sphere. In particular we focus on two problems: firstly we perform a Picard-Lefschetz decomposition of the localised path integral but, due to the absence of a topological theta angle in three dimensions, we find that steepest descent cycles do not permit us to distinguish between contributions to the path-integral coming from (would-be) different topological sectors, for example a vortex from a vortex/anti-vortex. The second problem we analyse is the truncation of all perturbative expansions. Although the partition function can be written as a transseries expansion of perturbative plus non-perturbative terms, due to the supersymmetric nature of the observable studied we have that each perturbative expansion around trivial and non-trivial saddles truncates suggesting that normal resurgence analysis cannot be directly applied. The first problem is solved by complexifying the squashing parameter, which can be thought of as introducing a chemical potential for the global equation rotation symmetry, or equivalently an omega deformation. This effectively introduces a hidden ""topological angle"" into the theory and the path integral can be now decomposed into a sum over different topological sectors via Picard-Lefschetz theory.

With this framework, it was possible to generate a CPT-even and CPT-odd generalized modifications of the electrodynamics in order to study the stability and causality of these theories considering the isotropic case for the background field. An additional analysis of unitarity at tree level was considered by studying the saturated propagators. After this analysis, we conclude that, while CPT-even modifications always preserves the stability, causality and unitarity in the boundaries of the effective field theory and therefore may be good candidates for field theories with interactions, the CPT-odd one violates causality and unitarity.

This review endeavors to not only introduce the historical development of the Yang-Baxter deformation, but also its relation to generalized supergravity, non-geometric backgrounds, non-abelian T-duality and preserved Killing spinors. We supplement the general treatment with a wealth of explicit examples.",2019,[],6
1904.01616,hep-th,"The critical behavior of a non-local scalar field theory is studied. This theory has a non-local quartic interaction term which involves a real power -letter of the Laplacian. The parameter letter can be tuned so as to make that interaction marginal for any dimension. The lowest order Feynman diagrams corresponding to coupling constant renormalization, mass renormalization, and field renormalization are computed. In all cases a non-trivial IR fixed point is obtained. Remarkably, for dimensions different from 4, field renormalization is required at the one-loop level. For d=4, the theory reduces to the usual local letter4 field theory and field renormalization is required starting at the the two-loop level. The critical exponents letter and letter are computed for dimensions 2,3,4 and 5. For dimensions greater than four, the critical exponent letter turns out to be negative for letter>0, which indicates a violation of the unitarity bounds.",2019,[],6
1911.12309,hep-th,"It is a well-studied phenomenon in AdSequation/CFTequation that pure states often appear 'too thermal' in the classical gravity limit, leading to a version of the information puzzle. One example is the case of a heavy scalar primary state, whose associated classical geometry is the BTZ black hole. Another example is provided by a heavy left-moving primary, which displays late time decay in chiral correlators. In this paper we study a special class of pure state geometries which do not display such information loss. They describe heavy CFT states created by a collection of chiral operators at various positions on the complex plane. In the bulk, these take the form of multi-centered solutions from the backreaction of a collection of spinning particles, which we construct for circular distributions of particles. We compute the two-point function of probe operators in these backgrounds and show that information is retrieved. We observe that the states for which our geometric picture is reliable are highly extended star-like objects in the bulk description.

We show that perturbatively in the weak coupling limit the octagon is given by a determinant constructed from the polylogarithms evaluating ladder Feynman graphs.

1908.07992,hep-th,"We investigate the holographic equation-wave superconductors in the presence of the higher order corrections on the gravity as well as on the gauge field side. On the gravity side, we add the Gauss-Bonnet curvature correction terms, while on the gauge field side we take the nonlinear Lagrangian in the form equation, where F is the Maxwell Lagrangian and b indicates the strength of nonlinearity. We employ the shooting method for the numerical calculations in order to obtain the ratio of the critical temperature equation over equation. We observe that by increasing the values of the mass and the nonlinear parameters the critical temperature decreases and thus the condensation becomes harder to form. In addition, the stronger Gauss-Bonnet parameter equation hinders the superconducting phase in Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Furthermore, we calculate the electrical conductivity based on the holographic setup. The real and imaginary parts are related to each other by Kramers-Kronig relation which indicates a delta function and pole in low frequency regime, respectively. However, at enough large frequencies the trend of real part can be interpreted by equation. Moreover, in holographic model the ratio equation is always much larger than the BCS value equation due to the strong coupling of holographic superconductors. In both gravity kinds, decreasing the temperature or increasing the effect of nonlinearity shifts the gap frequency toward larger values. Besides, the gap frequency is occurred at larger values by enlarging the Gauss-Bonnet parameter. In general, the behavior of conductivity depends on the choice of the mass, the nonlinear and the Gauss-Bonnet parameters.",2019,[],6

Another method is to perform an appropriate large speed of light expansion of a relativistic string. Both of the resulting non-relativistic string theories only have a well-defined spectrum if they have nonzero winding along a longitudinal spatial direction.

1912.09782,hep-th,"In this thesis, we study a variety of phenomena in strongly coupled quantum field theories by performing calculations in their gravitational duals. We compute entanglement entropy in a variety of holographic systems, paying particular attention to its long-distance behaviour, characterised by a term proportional to surface area. This term is known to decrease along Lorentz-invariant renormalisation group flows, suggesting that it may count massless degrees of freedom. We find that more general deformations may increase this area term, possibly indicating an enhanced number of long-distance degrees of freedom. We observe a correlation between this enhancement and the emergence of new scaling symmetry at long distances. Next, we study the spectrum of collective excitations in a holographic model of a non-Fermi liquid. At high temperatures, the spectrum of collective excitations includes hydrodynamic sound waves. As in similar models, we observe that sound-like modes also exist at low temperatures. Such modes are known as holographic zero sound. We study the changing properties of holographic zero sound and the emergence of hydrodynamic behaviour at high temperatures as we vary the parameters of the model. We find that for certain values of the parameters, the temperature-dependence of holographic zero sound qualitatively resembles that of a normal Fermi liquid. Finally, we study the entanglement entropy contribution of surface defects in a six-dimensional quantum field theory of relevance to M-theory, which is a candidate theory of quantum gravity. We find that the entanglement entropy does not montonically decrease along renormalisation group flows on these defects, ruling it out as a potential measure of degrees of freedom. On the other hand, we find that two of the contributions of the defect to the Weyl anomaly of the quantum field theory decrease along all of the flows that we study.",2019,[],6

We compute the twisted chiral superpotential that describes the effective theory on the surface operator using equivariant localization as well as the Seiberg-Witten data. We then use the constraints imposed by S-duality to resum the instanton contributions to the twisted superpotential into elliptic functions and (quasi-) modular forms. The resummed results match what one would obtain from the description of surface operators as the insertion of a degenerate operator in a spherical conformal block in Liouville CFT.,2019,[],6
1903.04437,hep-th,"We investigate the asymptotic structure of electromagnetism in Minkowski space in even and odd spacetime dimensions equation. We focus on equation since the case equation has been studied previously at length. We first consider spatial infinity where we provide explicit boundary conditions that admit the known physical solutions and make the formalism well defined (finite symplectic structure and charges). Contrary to the situation found in equation dimensions, there is no need to impose parity conditions under the antipodal map on the leading order of the fields when equation. There is, however, the same need to modify the standard bulk symplectic form by a boundary term at infinity involving a surface degree of freedom. This step makes the Lorentz boosts act canonically. Because of the absence of parity conditions, the theory is found to be invariant under two independent algebras of angle-dependent equation transformations (equation). We then integrate the equations of motion in order to find the behaviour of the fields near null infinity. We exhibit the radiative and Coulomb branches, characterized by different decays and parities. The analysis yields generalized matching conditions between the past of equation and the future of equation.",2019,[],6

By analyzing these correlators in superspace, we explain why the number of independent conformal anomalies is reduced in supersymmetric theories. For instance, non-supersymmetric CFTs in six dimensions have three independent conformal equation-anomalies, which determine the stress-tensor two- and three-point functions, but in superconformal theories the three equation-anomalies are subject to a linear constraint. We also describe anomaly multiplet relations, which express the conformal anomalies of a superconformal theory in terms of its 't Hooft anomalies. Following earlier work on the conformal equation-anomaly, we argue for these relations by considering the supersymmetric dilaton effective action on the tensor branch of such a theory. We illustrate the utility of these anomaly multiplet relations by presenting exact results for conformal anomalies, and hence current and stress-tensor correlators, in several interacting examples.",2019,[],6

By dimensional reduction we construct two off shell vector multiplet representations for each possible signature, and find that the corresponding Lagrangians always have a different relative sign between the scalar and the Maxwell term. In Lorentzian signature this is related to the existence of two non-isomorphic algebras, while in Euclidean and neutral signature the two theories are related by a local field redefinition which implements an isomorphism between the underlying supersymmetry algebras.",2019,[],6

1907.12810,hep-th,"We overview symmetries of string scattering amplitudes in the high energy limits of both the fixed angle or Gross regime (GR) and the fixed momentum transfer or Regge regime (RR). We calculated high energy string scattering amplitudes (SSA) at arbitrary mass levels for both regimes. We discovered the infinite linear relations among fixed angle string amplitudes and the infinite recurrence relations among Regge string amplitudes. The linear relations we obtained in the GR corrected the saddle point calculations by Gross, Gross and Mende. In addition, for the high energy closed string scatterings, our results differ from theirs by an oscillating prefactor which was crucial to recover the KLT relation valid for all energies. We showed that all the high energy string amplitudes can be solved by the linear or recurrence relations so that all the string amplitudes can be expressed in terms of a single string amplitude. We further found that, at each mass level, the ratios among the fixed angle amplitudes can be extracted from the Regge string scattering amplitudes. Finally, we review the recent developments on the discovery of infinite number of recurrence relations valid for all energies among Lauricella SSA.

1902.08894,hep-th,"In order to understand the confining decoupling solution of the Yang-Mills theory in the Landau gauge, we consider the massive Yang-Mills model which is defined by just adding a gluon mass term to the Yang-Mills theory with the Lorentz-covariant gauge fixing term and the associated Faddeev-Popov ghost term. First of all, we show that massive Yang-Mills model is obtained as a gauge-fixed version of the gauge-invariantly extended theory which is identified with the gauge-scalar model with a single fixed-modulus scalar field in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. This equivalence is obtained through the gauge-independent description of the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism proposed recently by one of the authors. Then, we reconfirm that the Euclidean gluon and ghost propagators in the Landau gauge obtained by numerical simulations on the lattice are reproduced with good accuracy from the massive Yang-Mills model by taking into account one-loop quantum corrections. Moreover, we demonstrate in a numerical way that the Schwinger function calculated from the gluon propagator in the Euclidean region exhibits violation of the reflection positivity at the physical point of the parameters. In addition, we perform the analytic continuation of the gluon propagator from the Euclidean region to the complex momentum plane towards the Minkowski region. We give an analytical proof that the reflection positivity is violated for any choice of the parameters in the massive Yang-Mills model, due to the existence of a pair of complex conjugate poles and the negativity of the spectral function for the gluon propagator to one-loop order. The complex structure of the propagator enables us to explain why the gluon propagator in the Euclidean region is well described by the Gribov-Stingl form.",2019,[],6

We then compute various three- and four-point amplitudes with insertions of coherent states, tachyons and vector bosons on the boundary of the disk relying on a convenient choice of reference null momenta. We find that the amplitudes exponentiate in a rather subtle and interesting way.

The resulting partition function is shown to satisfy a geometric flow equation, which perfectly reproduces the flow equations for the deformed energy levels that were previously derived in the literature. The S-matrix of the deformed QFT differs from the original S-matrix only by an overall phase factor that depends on the charges and momenta of the external particles, thus supporting the conjecture that such QFTs are UV complete, although intrinsically non-local.

The singleton is defined to be a Verma module of the AdSequation isometry subalgebra equation with conformal weight equation.

As is well known, CP transformation is not a symmetry of the system anywhere on the loop, except at the endpoints. By augmenting CP with a chirality transformation, we observe that the Dirac Hamiltonian is odd under the new transformation precisely at the sphaleron, and this ensures the mirror symmetry of the spectrum, including the continua. As a consistency check, we show that the fermionic zero mode presented by Ringwald in the sphaleron background is invariant under the new transformation. The spectral mirror symmetry which we establish here, together with the presence of the zero mode, are the two necessary conditions whence the fermion number equation of the sphaleron can be inferred using the reasoning presented by Jackiw and Rebbi or, equivalently, using the spectral deficiency equation of the Dirac sea.

We study the first-order phase transition coexistence curves of the HL AdS black holes by the Maxwell's equal-area law, and give the boundary of two-phase coexistence zone. It is very interesting that the first-order phase transition point is determined by the pressure F on the surface of the HL AdS black hole's horizon, instead of only the pressure P (or the temperature T).

This review is intended to provide a pedagogical introduction to some of these developments. We will first review some amplitudes background using four-point amplitudes as main examples. Then we generalize these techniques to form factors, including (1) tree-level form factors, (2) Sudakov form factor and infrared singularities, and (3) form factors of general operators and their anomalous dimensions.

These are in turn utilized to update the agent's policy and value neural networks to improve its behavior. By reinforcement learning, the agent's performance in both tasks is significantly improved, and for some tasks it finds a factor of O(200) more solutions than a random walker. In one case, we demonstrate that the agent learns a human-derived strategy for finding consistent string models. In another case, where no human-derived strategy exists, the agent learns a genuinely new strategy that achieves the same goal twice as efficiently per unit time.

By using our general formula, we show that the EE of multiple intervals for a holographic CFT is just a summation of the single interval case even with the small deformation. This is a non-trivial consequence from the field theory perspective, though it may be expected by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in holography. However, the deformed RE of the two intervals is a summation of the single interval case only if the separations between the intervals are big enough. It can be understood by the tension of the cosmic branes dual to the RE. We also study the holographic EE for single and two intervals with an arbitrary cut-off radius (dual to the equation deformation) at any temperature. We confirm our holographic results agree with the field theory results with a small deformation and high temperature limit, as expected.

This parameter can be understood as a 1d FI parameter for the effective supersymmetric quantum mechanics on equation. Using supersymmetric localisation, the twisted index can be expressed as a contour integral. We show that the contour prescription is modified in the presence of the 1d FI parameter, leading to wall-crossing phenomena for the twisted index. In particular, we derive a general wall-crossing formula for abelian gauge theories. We also examine the origin of wall-crossing as change of stability condition in the algebro-geometric interpretation of the twisted index. These ideas are illustrated for abelian theories with equation supersymmetry and in a non-abelian example that reproduces wall-crossing phenomena associated to moduli spaces of stable pairs.",2019,[],6

Classical instability is connected with unboundedness of the canonical energy, while the unbounded energy spectrum leads to the quantum instability. For a wide class of higher derivative theories, including the extended Chern-Simons, other bounded conserved quantities which provide the stability can exist. The most general gauge invariant extended Chern-Simons theory of arbitrary finite order equation admits equation-parameter series of conserved energy-momentum tensors. If the equation-component of the most general representative of this series is bounded, the theory is stable.

We find that our approach reduces to the standard Dirichlet-like approach, when restricted to the boundary of AdS. But in more general settings, the analytic continuation of the Dirichlet Green function does not lead to a Feynman propagator in the bulk. Our prescription avoids this problem. Furthermore, in Lorentzian signature we find an additional homogeneous mode. This is a natural proxy for the AdS normalizable mode and allows us to do bulk reconstruction. We also find that the extrapolate and differential dictionaries match. Perturbatively adding bulk interactions to these discussions is straightforward.

These states are connected via an effective coupling function which encodes the details of the gauge algebra of the LST and which in its simplest (non-trivial) form is captured by the scalar Greens function on the torus. More complicated incarnations of this function show certain similarities with so-called modular graph functions, which have appeared in the study of Feynman amplitudes in string- and field theory.

We give a prescription for computing the number of large bulk dimensions, equation, from strongly-coupled CFTequation data, where ""large"" means parametrically of order the AdS scale. The idea is that unitarity of 1-loop AdS amplitudes, dual to non-planar CFT correlators, fixes equation in terms of tree-level data. We make this observation rigorous by deriving a positive-definite sum rule for the 1-loop double-discontinuity in the flat space/bulk-point limit. This enables us to prove an array of AdS/CFT folklore, and to infer new properties of large equation CFTs at strong coupling that ensure consistency of emergent large extra dimensions with string/M-theory. We discover an OPE universality at the string scale: to leading order in large equation, heavy-heavy-light three-point functions, with heavy operators that are parametrically lighter than a power of equation, are linear in the heavy conformal dimension. We explore its consequences for supersymmetric CFTs and explain how emergent large extra dimensions relate to a Sublattice Weak Gravity Conjecture for CFTs.

For the equation, we show that the main part of the amplitude for equation is a special case of that for equation or equation case. For all other equation cases, we show that the amplitude is just a special case of the corresponding one for equation case. Combining both, we obtain the general formula for the amplitude, which is valid for each of the cases considered and for arbitrary constant worldvolume fluxes. The corresponding general open string one-loop annulus amplitude is also obtained by a Jacobi transformation of the general cylinder one. We give also the general open string pair production rate. We study the properties of the amplitude such as the nature of the interaction, the open string tachyonic instability, and the possible open string pair production and its potential enhancement. In particular, in the presence of pure magnetic fluxes or magnetic-like fluxes, we find that the nature of interaction is correlated with the existence of potential open string tachyonic instability. When the interaction is attractive, there always exists an open string tachyonic instability when the brane separation reaches the minimum determined by the so-called tachyonic shift. When the interaction is repulsive, there is no such instability for any brane separation.

New degrees of freedom can be identified either, as just described, by looking at the poles of the graviton propagator corrected by quantum gravity or by mapping the Jordan frame theory to the Einstein frame theory. While this procedure is very well defined for second order curvature terms in the effective action, we point out that higher order terms in curvature lead to a nonlinear and non-local relation between the propagating scalar degree of freedom and the Ricci scalar.

1908.09310,hep-th,"We study the general time dependence of complexity for holographic states dual to Lovelock black holes using the ""Complexity=Action"" (CA) proposal. We observe that at early times, the critical time at which the complexity begins to increase is a decreasing function of the higher order coupling constants, which implies that the complexity evolves faster than that of Schwarzschild black holes. At late times, the rate of change of complexity is essentially determined by the generalised Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term evaluated at the future singularity. In particular, its ratio to black hole mass is a characteristic constant, independent of the higher order couplings. Thus, in the vanishing coupling limit, the result in general does not reduce to that of Schwarzschild black holes, in spite of that the metric reduces to the latter as well as the gravitational action. In fact, the two differ by a constant during the whole time evolution. Including the next-to-leading order term around late times, we find that as the Einstein case, the late time limit is always approached from above, thus violating any conjectured upper bound given by the late time result. For charged Lovelock black holes, we find that with sufficient charge, the complexity roughly behaves the same as the Einstein case. However, for smaller charges, the two have some significant differences. In particular, unlike the Einstein case, in the uncharged limit the complexity growth rate does not match with the neutral case, differing by a constant in the whole time evolution.",2019,[],6

Of the four principal types of singularities that can occur - specified by their limiting mixed Hodge structure - only the K-points and the large radius points (or more generally the M-points) are at infinite distance and therefore of interest to the SDC. We argue that the conjecture is fulfilled at the K- and the M-points, including models with several M-points, using explicit calculations in hypergeometric models which contain typical examples of all these degenerations.

In particular, the time slice of the cut-off surface is dual to the ground state of the equation-deformed CFT.

This calculation is based on boundary string field theory, and we have a problem of a choice of Weyl factors on the two boundaries of one-loop open string world-sheet. We have chosen one of them and compute the one-loop free energy. In this paper, we derive the mass spectrum of open strings on a D-brane--anti-D-brane pair supposing that the world-sheet is a strip, and compute the thermal vacuum state, free energy and the partition function for a single open string in the framework of thermo field dynamics. From this we can reproduce the free energy for multiple strings in the case of Matsubara method. This fact reinforces our argument of the choice of the Weyl factors in the case of Matsubara formalism.",2019,[],6

In one region, the growth of the low energy states is Hagedorn, which indicates a stringy dual. In the other, the growth is much slower, and compatible with the spectrum of a supergravity theory on AdSequation. We provide a simple diagnostic which places any symmetric product orbifold in either region. We construct a class of elliptic genera with such supergravity-like growth, indicating the possible existence of new realizations of AdSequation/CFTequation where the bulk is a semi-classical supergravity theory. In such cases, we give exact expressions for the BPS degeneracies, which could be matched with the spectrum of perturbative states in a dual supergravity description.",2019,[],6

These identities are applied in a variety of contexts in CFT, as for example in the derivation of the DOZZ 3-point function. Reversing the logic, we can try to guess new 3d IR dualities which reduce to more intricate duality relations for the DF correlators. For example, we show that a recently proposed duality relating the U(N) theory with one flavor and one adjoint to a WZ model can be regarded as the 3d ancestor of the evaluation formula for the DF integral representation of the 3-point correlator. We are also able to interpret the analytic continuation in the number of screening charges, which is performed on the CFT side to reconstruct the DOZZ 3-point function, as the geometric transition relating the 3d U(N) theory to the 5d T2 theory.",2019,[],6

To extend the computation to non-compact groups we need to perform an appropriate analytic continuation of the partition function of the compact group. Non-vacuum characters are found by inserting a Wilson loop in the functional integral. We then extend our method to Euclidean Anti-de Sitter pure gravity in three dimensions.

The expression is given in terms of a Rademacher expansion, which converges for spin equation. For a finite number of light operators the expression agrees with a variant of the Poincare construction developed by Maloney, Witten and Keller.

As an example, we show how the classification of equation theories by Aharony, Seiberg and Tachikawa can be understood in terms of choices of boundary conditions for RR fields in IIB. Along the way we encounter a formula for the fractional instanton number of equation ADE theories in terms of the torsional linking pairing for rational homology spheres.

These integrals do not vanish due to singularities of the integrands. This implies that the equation-function beyond the one-loop approximation is given by the sum of the singular contributions, which is calculated in all orders for singularities produced by the matter superfields and by the Faddeev--Popov ghosts.

In other words, we study the behavior of the equation-deformed equation SYM theory in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit near those singular points, where naively the W-boson with non-vanishing angular momentum becomes massless. Upon a proper resummation of instanton contributions, these singularities disappear, which is similar to the Seiberg-Witten solution in the undeformed case where there is no massless W-boson.

There are tensionless strings whenever two M5 branes coincide or whenever an M5 brane approaches the M9 plane. These systems do not admit a low-energy Lagrangian description so new techniques are desirable to shed light on the physics of these phenomena. The 6-dimensional N=(1,0) world-volume theory on the M5 branes is composed of massless vector, tensor, and hyper multiplets, and has two branches of the vacuum moduli space where either the scalar fields in the tensor or hyper multiplets receive vacuum expectation values. Focusing on the Higgs branch of the low-energy theory, previous works suggest the conjecture that a new Higgs branch arises whenever a BPS-string becomes tensionless. Consequently, a single theory admits a multitude of Higgs branches depending on the types of tensionless strings in the spectrum. The two main phenomena discrete gauging and small E8 instanton transition can be treated in a concise and effective manner by means of Coulomb branches of 3-dimensional N=4 gauge theories. In this paper, a formalism is introduced that allows to derive a novel object from a brane configuration, called the magnetic quiver. The main features are as follows: (i) the 3d Coulomb branch of the magnetic quiver yields the Higgs branch of the 6d system, (ii) all discrete gauging and E8 instanton transitions have an explicit brane realisation, and (iii) exceptional symmetries arise directly from brane configurations.

1910.11659,hep-th,"Gribov ambiguity is a problem that arises when we try to single out the physical gauge degree of freedom in non-Abelian gauge theory by imposing the covariant gauge constraint. Unfortunately, the solution of the gauge constraint is not unique, thus the redundant gauge degree of freedom, called Gribov copies, remains unfixed. One of the traditional methods to partially resolve the Gribov problem is to restrict the space of gauge orbits inside the bounded region known as the Gribov region. The meaning of partially resolve is that this procedure can solve only the positivity's problem of the Faddeev-Popov operator but the Gribov copies are still there. However, on the bright side, the restriction to the Gribov region leads to the modification of the gluon propagator. Additionally, the new form of the gluon propagator yields the violation of the reflection positivity which is considered as the important axiom of the Euclidean quantum field theory. This shows that the gluon field in the Gribov region is an unphysical particle or technically confined. In this review article, we will start by discussing the traditional Faddeev-Popov method and its consequence on the proof of the unitarity of the perturbative Yang-Mills theory. Next, we will discuss the blind spot of the Faddeev-Popov quantization and study the mathematical and physical origin of the Gribov problem.

At finite N these couplings acquire a beta function. We compute the beta function exactly for equation, at leading order in 1/N. For equation we find four fixed points, one of which is triply-degenerate. We show that at large N there are at most six fixed points for any equation, and conjecture that there are exactly six, with three of them stable (including a point with enhanced equation supersymmetry). The strong-weak coupling dualities of equation Chern-Simons-matter theories map each of these fixed points to a dual one. We show that at large N the phase structure near each of the three stable fixed points is different. For equation we analyze the fixed points at weak coupling, and we work out the action of the strong-weak coupling duality on the marginal and relevant superpotential couplings at large N (which was previously known only for equation). In addition, we compute in these theories the 2-point and 3-point functions of the lowest gauge-invariant singlet superfield at large N, for all values of equation and of the superpotential couplings, and use them to test the large N dualities. This computation is one of the ingredients needed for a computation of the beta function at order 1/N for all equation, which we leave for future work.

The examples of unfree gauge symmetries include volume preserving diffeomorphisms in the unimodular gravity and various higher spin field theories with transverse gauge symmetries. All the known examples of the models with unfree gauge symmetry share one common feature. They admit local quantities which vanish on shell, though they are not linear combinations of Lagrangian equations and their derivatives. We term these quantities as mass shell completion functions.   In the case of usual gauge symmetry with unconstrained gauge parameters, the irreducible gauge algebra involves the two basic constituents: the action functional and gauge symmetry generators. For the case of unfree gauge symmetry, we identify two more basic constituents: operators of gauge parameter constraints and completion functions. These two extra constituents are involved in the algebra of unfree gauge symmetry on equal footing with action and gauge symmetry generators.   Proceeding from the algebra, we adjust the Faddeev-Popov (FP) path integral quantization scheme to the case of unfree gauge symmetry. The modified FP action involves the operators of the constraints imposed on the gauge parameters, while the corresponding BRST transformation involves the completion functions.

Unlike Ref.\citebnbstip2, where we used the first order theory, in this article fermionic momenta are integrated out. Full T-dualization in double space is represented as permutation of initial equation and T-dual coordinates equation. Demanding that T-dual transformation law of the T-dual double coordinate equation is of the same form as for initial one equation, we obtain the form of the T-dual background fields in terms of the initial ones. Advantage of using the action with integrated fermionic momenta is that it gives all T-dual background fields in terms of the initial ones.

In specific three-point cases involving massive scalars the resulting recurrence relations can be solved, e.g. reproducing purely from symmetry a three-point function coefficient known in the literature.

1909.02002,hep-th,"There are strong reasons to believe that global symmetries of quantum theories cannot be exact in the presence of gravity. While this has been argued at the qualitative level, establishing a quantitative statement is more challenging. In this work we take new steps towards quantifying symmetry violation in EFTs with gravity. First, we evaluate global charge violation by microscopic black holes present in a thermal system, which represents an irreducible, universal effect at finite temperature. Second, based on general QFT considerations, we propose that local symmetry-violating processes should be faster than black hole-induced processes at any sub-Planckian temperature. Such a proposal can be seen as part of the ""swampland"" program to constrain EFTs emerging from quantum gravity. Considering an EFT perspective, we formulate a conjecture which requires the existence of operators violating global symmetry and places quantitative bounds on them. We study the interplay of our conjecture with emergent symmetries in QFT. In models where gauged U(1)'s enforce accidental symmetries, we find that constraints from the Weak Gravity Conjecture can ensure that our conjecture is satisfied. We also study the consistency of the conjecture with QFT models of emergent symmetries such as extradimensional localization, the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism, and the clockwork mechanism.",2019,[],6
1910.01690,hep-th,"It is generally agreed that black hole formation in gravity corresponds to thermalization in the dual CFT. It is sometimes argued that if the CFT evolution shows evidence of large redshift in gravity, then we have seen black hole formation in the CFT. We argue that this is not the case: a clock falling towards the horizon increases its redshift but remains intact as a clock; thus it is not `thermalized'. Instead, thermalization should correspond to a new phase after the phase of large redshift, where the infalling object turns into fuzzballs on reaching within planck distance of the horizon. We compute simple examples of the scattering vertex in the D1D5 CFT which, after many iterations, would lead to thermalization. An initial state made of two left-moving and two right-moving excitations corresponds, in gravity, to two gravitons heading towards each other. The thermalization vertex in the CFT breaks these excitations into multiple excitations on the left and right sides; we compute the amplitudes for several of these processes. We find secular terms that grow as equation instead of oscillating with equation; we conjecture that this may be a feature of processes leading to thermalization.",2019,[],6

We explain the origin of these terms from a well-known, unitarity-restoring exponentiation of the high-energy gravitational equation-matrix in impact-parameter space.

1902.02309,hep-th,"Soft-operators, loosely speaking, are operators which create or annihilate zero energy massless particles on the celestial sphere in Minkowski space. The Lorentz group acts on the celestial sphere by conformal transformation and the soft-operators transform as conformal primary operators of various dimension and spin. Working in space-time dimensions equation and equation, we study some properties of the conformal representations with the (leading) soft photon and graviton as the highest weight vectors. Typically these representations contain null-vectors. We argue, from the equation-matrix point of view, that infinite dimensional asymptotic symmetries and conformal invariance require us to set some of these null-vectors to zero. As a result, the corresponding soft-operator satisfies linear PDE on the celestial sphere. Curiously, these PDEs are equations of motion of Euclidean gauge theories on the celestial sphere with scalar gauge-invariance, i.e, the gauge parameter is a scalar field on the sphere. These are probably related to large equation and supertranslation transformations at infinity. Now, the PDE satisfied by the soft-operator can be converted into PDE for the equation-matrix elements with the insertion of the soft-operator. These equations can then be solved subject to appropriate boundary conditions on the celestial sphere, provided by conformal invariance. The solutions determine the soft equation-matrix elements, for different helicities of the soft-particle, in terms of a single scalar function. This makes the Ward-identity for the asymptotic symmetry almost integrable. The result of the integration, which we are not able to perform completely, should of course be Weinberg's soft-theorem. Finally, we comment on the similarity between the roles played by null-states in the context of asymptotic symmetry and in string theory in relation to space-time gauge symmetry.",2019,[],6

The compactified theory possesses an exact zero-form color-flavor center symmetry for a special choice of flavor holonomy (under which Polyakov loop is charged), despite the absence of one-form center-symmetry. We prove that the CFC symmetry is stable at small-equation. This is the opposite of the high-temperature limit of thermal theory and a dramatic manifestation of quantum distillation.

At large and intermediate distances, these geometries very closely approximate the extremal-BTZequationSequation geometry of the black hole, but instead of having an event horizon, these geometries have a smooth highly-redshifted global-AdSequationSequation cap in the IR.

However, the significance of this integrand had not really been investigated so far.

In each case, the decoupling equation has the form of zero field-strength condition with the soft operator as the (gauge) potential. Null-state decoupling effectively reduces the number of polarisation states of the soft particle and is crucial in deriving soft-theorems from the Ward identities of asymptotic symmetries. To the best of our understanding, these properties are not directly related to the Lorentz invariance of the equation-matrix or the existence of asymptotic symmetries.

Here, we show that the spectral flow operator naturally emerges in the Liouville field theory description of the WZW correlation functions once it is combined with a series of duality relations among conformal integrals. By considering multiple insertions of spectral flow operators, we study the dependence on the moduli for arbitrary number of them, and we show explicitly that the amplitude does not depend on the specific locations of the accessory insertions in the worldsheet, as required by consistency. This generalizes previous computations in which particular cases were considered. This can also be thought of as an alternative proof of the WZW-Liouville correspondence in the case of maximally winding violating correlators.",2019,[],6

1910.03603,hep-th,"We consider compactifications of equation minimal equation type conformal matter SCFTs on a generic Riemann surface. We derive the theories corresponding to three punctured spheres (trinions) with three maximal punctures, from which one can construct models corresponding to generic surfaces. The trinion models are simple quiver theories with equation equation gauge nodes. One of the three puncture non abelian symmetries is emergent in the IR. The derivation of the trinions proceeds by analyzing RG flows between conformal matter SCFTs with different values of equation and relations between their subsequent reductions to equation. In particular, using the flows we first derive trinions with two maximal and one minimal punctures, and then we argue that collections of equation minimal punctures can be interpreted as a maximal one. This suggestion is checked by matching the properties of the equation models such as `t Hooft anomalies, symmetries, and the structure of the conformal manifold to the expectations from equation. We then use the understanding that collections of minimal punctures might be equivalent to maximal ones to construct trinions with three maximal punctures, and then equation theories corresponding to arbitrary surfaces, for equation models described by two equation branes probing a equation singularity. This entails the introduction of a novel type of maximal puncture. Again, the suggestion is checked by matching anomalies, symmetries and the conformal manifold to expectations from six dimensions. These constructions thus give us a detailed understanding of compactifications of two sequences of six dimensional SCFTs to four dimensions.",2019,[],6

We show the OPE block is given by integrating a higher spin field along a geodesic in the Lorentzian AdS space-time when the two operators are space-like separated. When the two operators are time-like separated however, we find the OPE block has a peculiar representation where the dual gravitational theory is not defined on the AdS space-time but on a hyperboloid with an additional time coordinate and Minkowski space-time on its boundary.

Based on the possible large scale Lorentz violation, we define an effective cosmological constant which depends not only on the bare cosmological constant but also on the Lorentz violation effect. We find the evolution of the effective cosmological constant exhibits the behavior of quintessence potential when the bare cosmological constant is from string landscape in contrary to the existence of local minimum during evolution while the bare cosmological constant is supplied by the swampland.

Such a four-point function can be computed, on the gravity side, as a two-point function of the light operator in a black hole geometry created by the heavy operator. We consider analytically solving the corresponding scalar field equation in a near-boundary expansion and find that the multi-stress tensor conformal blocks are insensitive to the horizon boundary condition. The main result of this paper is that the lowest-twist operator product expansion (OPE) coefficients of the multi-stress tensor conformal blocks are universal: they are fixed by the dimension of the light operators and the ratio between the dimension of the heavy operator and the central charge equation. Neither supersymmetry nor unitary is assumed. Higher-twist coefficients, on the other hand, generally are not protected. A recursion relation allows us to efficiently compute universal lowest-twist coefficients.

Exploiting the derivative expansion, BRST cohomological methods fix the solution up to choice of renormalization conditions, without inputting the form of the classical, or bare, interactions. Legendre transformation results in an equivalent description in terms of solving the modified Slavnov-Taylor identities and the flow of the Legendre effective action under an infrared cutoff equation (i.e. effective average action). The flow generates a canonical transformation that automatically solves the Slavnov-Taylor identities for the wavefunction renormalization constants.

The induced three dimensional theory shows a strong-weak coupling duality which separates different regimes described by different covariant actions. The role of the Maxwell term in the bulk action is discussed, together with the relevance of the topological nature of the bulk action for the boundary physics.",2019,[],6
1904.06339,hep-th,"We study the general deformation of equation supersymmetry transformations of a vector multiplet that forms a (constant) triplet under the equation R-symmetry corresponding to the magnetic dual of the triplet of the Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) parameters.

We then consider the impact of the deformation in the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action where one supersymmetry is non-linearly realised, described by a nilpotent constraint on the deformed equation chiral-chiral superfield.

Our results show that the topologically twisted indices of the proposed dual superconformal field theories precisely reproduce the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of this class of black holes.

We also conjecture that the effective 2d equation SCFTs living on the self-dual strings of the 6d theories lead to holographically dual descriptions of type IIB string theory on equation and moreover that their elliptic genera can be used to compute the degeneracies of 5d spinning BPS black holes along with all-genus topological string amplitudes on the corresponding compact 3-fold. In the case of 5d supergravity, we consider M-theory on compact Calabi-Yau 3-folds and using similar ideas as in the 6d case we show the complete non-gravitational sector of 5d supergravity theories can be decomposed into coupled 5d equation SCFTs.

1912.13502,hep-th,"We study the spectrum of BPS particles on the Coulomb branch of five-dimensional superconformal field theories (5d SCFTs) compactified on a circle. By engineering these theories in M-theory on equation, for equation an isolated Calabi-Yau threefold singularity, we naturally identify the BPS category of the 5d theory on a circle with the derived category of coherent sheaves on a resolution of equation. It follows that the BPS spectrum can be studied in terms of 5d BPS quivers, which are the fractional-brane quivers for the singularity equation. 5d BPS quivers generalize the well-studied 4d BPS quivers for 4d equation gauge theories that can be obtained from equation in so-called geometric engineering limits. We study the interplay between 4d and 5d BPS quivers in detail. We particularly focus on examples when equation is a toric singularity, in which case the 5d BPS quiver is given in terms of a brane tiling. For instance, the well-studied equation brane tiling gives a 5d BPS quiver for the equation 5d gauge theory. We present a conjecture about the structure of the BPS spectra of a wide class of models, which we test in the simple case of the 5d equation theory (more precisely, the equation SCFT).

For states of fixed area on the equation HRT-surfaces, we argue that the bulk geometry equation dual to the newly sewn state is given by deleting the entanglement wedges of equation from equation, gluing the remaining complementary entanglement wedges of equation together across the HRT surface, and solving the equations of motion to the past and future. The argument uses the bulk path integral and assumes it to be dominated by a certain natural saddle. For states where the HRT area is not fixed, the same bulk cut-and-paste is dual to a modified sewing that produces a generalization of the canonical purification state equation discussed recently by Dutta and Faulkner.

1912.02773,hep-th,"M5 branes on a D-type ALE singularity display various phenomena that introduce additional massless degrees of freedom. The M5 branes are known to fractionate on a D-type singularity. Whenever two fractional M5 branes coincide, tensionless strings arise. Therefore, these systems do not admit a low-energy Lagrangian description. Focusing on the 6-dimensional N=(1,0) world-volume theories on the M5 branes, the vacuum moduli space has two branches were either the scalar fields in the tensor multiplet or the scalars in the hypermultiplets acquire a non-trivial vacuum expectation value. As suggested in previous work, the Higgs branch may change drastically whenever a BPS-string becomes tensionless. Recently, magnetic quivers have been introduced with the aim to capture all Higgs branches over any point of the tensor branch. In this paper, the formalism is extended to Type IIA brane configurations involving O6 planes. Since the 6d N=(1,0) theories are composed of orthosymplectic gauge groups, the derivation rules for the magnetic quiver in the presence of O6 planes have to be conjectured. This is achieved by analysing the 6d theories for a single M5 brane on a D-type singularity and deriving the magnetic quivers for the finite and infinite gauge coupling Higgs branch from a brane configuration. The validity of the proposed derivation rules is underpinned by deriving the associated Hasse diagram. For multiple M5 branes, the approach of this paper provides magnetic quivers for all Higgs branches over any point of the tensor branch. In particular, an interesting infinite gauge coupling transition is found that is related to the SO(8) non-Higgsable cluster.",2019,[],6

In this limit, a single complex adjoint scalar field survives, and part of its interaction is obtained by exactly integrating out the gauge boson of the SYM theory. Taking into account normal ordering, the interactions match the one-loop dilatation operator of the equation sector, establishing the consistency of the limit at the quantum level. We discover a tantalizing field-theoretic structure, corresponding to a equation-dimensional complex chiral boson on a circle coupled to a nondynamical gauge field, both in the adjoint representation of equation. The successful construction of a lower-dimensional nonrelativistic field theory in the equation near-BPS limit provides a proof of concept for other BPS bounds.

First, we discuss renormalization properties of a class of gauged linear sigma models (GLSM) which reduce to equation non-linear sigma models (NLSM) in the low-energy limit. Sometimes they are referred to as the Hanany-Tong models. If supersymmetry is equation the ultraviolet-divergent logarithm in LGSM appears, in the renormalization of the Fayet-Iliopoulos parameter, and is exhausted by a single tadpole graph. This is not the case in the daughter NLSMs. As a result, the one-loop renormalizations are different in GLSMs and their daughter NLSMs We explain this difference and identify its source.   In particular, we show why at equation there is no UV logarithms in the parent GLSM, while they do appear on the corresponding NLSM does not vanish. In the second part of the paper we discuss the same problem for a class of equation GLSMs considered previously.

1901.02097,hep-th,"The subject of this thesis is the construction and the study of four-dimensional effective theories with spontaneously broken and non-linearly realised global and local supersymmetry. In the first part, the global supersymmetric case is analysed. The discussion starts from the supersymmetry breaking sector, describing the goldstino and its interactions, in the case of minimal supersymmetry and it is then generalised to a generic number of spontaneously broken supersymmetry generators. A systematic procedure is given in order to construct effective theories with non-linearly realised supersymmetry and with any desired spectrum content. In the second part of the thesis, non-linear realisations are analysed in the case of local supersymmetry, namely supergravity. The coupling of the goldstino sector to gravity is presented first and the superhiggs mechanism on a generic background is discussed. Matter couplings are then constructed in some simple examples. A new class of models is introduced in which supersymmetry is spontaneously broken and non-linearly realised already on the gravity sector. As a consequence, it is possible to construct actions in which the cosmological constant is bounded to be positive, which can be motivated for studying inflation. Two applications of non-linear realisations in local supersymmetry are discussed in detail. In the first one it is shown how to implement Kahler invariance in a way that mimics the global supersymmetric case. In particular, the Kahler--Hodge restriction on the scalar manifold, which is typical of supergravity, is avoided. In the second application the role of non-linear realisations in the construction of de Sitter vacua is discussed. Attention is devoted to the relationship with known de Sitter uplift constructions and with a new, recently proposed D-term in supergravity.",2019,[],6

1907.09581,hep-th,"It is believed that thermalization drives the reduced density matrix of a subsystem to approach a short-range entangled operator. If the initial state is also short-range entangled, it is possible that the reduced density matrix remains low-entangled throughout thermalization; or there could exist a barrier with high operator entanglement between the initial and thermalized reduced density matrix. In this paper, we study such dynamics in three classes of models: the rational CFTs, the random unitary circuit, and the holographic CFTs, representing systems of increasing quantum chaoticity. We show that in all three classes of models, the operator entanglement (or variant of) exhibits three phases, a linear growth phase, a plateau phase, and a decay phase. The plateau phase characterized by volume-law operator entanglement corresponds to the barrier in operator entanglement. While it is present in all three models, its persistence and exit show interesting distinctions among them. The rational CFTs have the shortest plateau phase, followed by the slowest decay phase; the holographic CFTs mark the opposite end, i.e. having the longest plateau phase followed by a discontinuous drop; and the random unitary circuit shows the intermediate behavior.

1906.05834,hep-th,"Three-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) with slightly broken higher spin symmetry provide an interesting laboratory to study general properties of CFTs and their roles in the AdS/CFT correspondence. In this work we compute the four-point functions at arbitrary 't Hooft coupling equation in the CFTs with slightly broken higher spin symmetry. We use a bootstrap approach based on the approximate higher spin Ward identity. We show that the bootstrap equation is separated into two parts with opposite parity charges, and it leads to a recursion relation for the equation expansions of the correlation functions. The equation expansions terminate at order equation and the solutions are exact in equation. Our work generalizes the approach proposed by Maldacena and Zhiboedov to four-point correlators, and it amounts to an on-shell study for the equation Chern-Simons vector models and the Vasiliev theory in equation. Besides, we show that the same results can also be obtained rather simply from bosonization duality of equation Chern-Simons vector models. The odd term at order equation in the spinning four-point function relates to the free boson correlator through a Legendre transformation. This provides new evidence on the equation bosonization duality at the spinning four-point function level.

To overcome this unsatisfactory results, we evaluate equation and EOM against a solution itself, equation, for more general class of pure gauge form solution written in equation and equation in this paper. Then we obtain general formula of equation and equation. From this result, we show that there is an infinite number of solutions that equation takes any integer value while keeping equation.

The BTZ black holes can be rendered traversable by a negative energy shock wave. Following Gao, Jafferis and Wall [1], we show that the negative energy shock wave is dual to the infinite boost limit of a specific double trace deformation which couples the left and right CFTs. We spell out the mechanism of information transfer through traversable BTZ wormholes, treating the backreaction of the message as a positive energy shockwave. The corresponding spacetime is that of colliding spherical shells in the BTZ black hole, which we explicitly construct. This construction allows us to obtain a bound on the amount of information that can be sent through the wormhole, which is consistent with previous work in the context of nearly equation gravity [2]. Consequently, we define a notion of traversibility of the wormhole and study it in the context of a multiple shock geometry. We argue that the time-dependence of traversibility in this geometry can be connected to certain aspects of the black hole evaporation process, such as the second half of the Page curve. Finally, we examine the claim that traversable wormholes are fast decoders. We find evidence for this by computing the scrambling time in the shockwave background and showing that it is delayed by the presence of the negative energy shock wave.",2019,[],6

In the limit of a single Proca field, we reproduce the known healthy interaction terms. We provide the necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure ghost-freedom in any multi-field setup.

1902.02541,hep-th,"The 3d spin-3 gravity theory is holographically dual to a 2d equation-extended CFT. In a large-c limit the symmetry algebra of the CFT reduces to equation. On the ground of symmetry the dual bulk space-time will be given by an 8d group manifold equation. Hence we need to introduce five extra coordinates in addition to three ordinary ones. The 3d space-time is a 3d hyper-surface equation embedded at constant values of the extra variables. Operators in the CFT at the boundary of equation are expressed in terms of equation descendants of the operators at the boundary of equation, where the extra variables vanish. In this paper it is shown that AdS/CFT correspondence for a scalar field coupled to 3d spin-3 gravity is realized in this auxiliary 8d space. A bulk-to-boundary propagator of a scalar field is found and a generating functional of boundary two-point functions of scalar equation-descendant operators is obtained by using the classical action for the scalar field. Classically, the scalar field must satisfy both Klein-Gordon equation and a third-order differential equation, which are related to the quadratic and cubic Casimir operators of equation. It is found that the coefficient function of the derivatives of the scalar field in the latter equation is the spin-3 gauge field, when restricted to the hypersurface.

We term this effect Magnetic Meson Melting (MMM), and we are able to observe it by constructing a configuration that makes it possible to apply gauge/gravity methods to study fundamental degrees of freedom in a quark-gluon plasma subject to a magnetic field as intense as that expected in high energy collisions. This is achieved by the confection of a ten-dimensional background that is dual to the magnetized plasma and nonetheless permits the embedding of D7-branes in it. For such a background to exist, a scalar field has to be present and hence a scalar operator of dimension 2 appears in the gauge theory.

In turn, first we consider the SO(1,4) subgroup of the SO(1,5) algebra, in which we were led to, as we want to gauge the isometry part of the full symmetry. Then, the construction of a gauge theory on such a noncommutative space directs us to use an extension of the gauge group, the SO(1,5)equationU(1), and fix its representation. Moreover, a 2-form dynamic gauge field is included in the theory for reasons of covariance of the transformation of the field strength tensor. Finally, the gauge theory is considered to be spontaneously broken to the Lorentz group with an extension of a U(1), i.e. SO(1,3)equationU(1).

1907.00867,hep-th,"The eikonal phase which determines the Regge limit of the gravitational scattering amplitude of a light particle off a heavy one in Minkowski spacetimes admits an expansion in the ratio of the Schwarzschild radius of the heavy particle to the impact parameter. Such an eikonal phase in AdS spacetimes of any dimensionality has been computed to all orders and reduces to the corresponding Minkowski result when both the impact parameter and the Schwarzschild radius are much smaller than the AdS radius. The leading term in the AdS eikonal phase can be reproduced in the dual CFT by a single stress tensor conformal block, but the subleading term is a result of an infinite sum of the double stress tensor contributions. We provide a closed form expression for the OPE coefficients of the leading twist double stress tensors in four spacetime dimensions and perform the sum to compute the corresponding lightcone behavior of a heavy-heavy-light-light CFT correlator. The resulting compact expression passes a few nontrivial independent checks. In particular, it agrees with the subleading eikonal phase at large impact parameter.",2019,[],6

Surprisingly, it is shown that these contributions are planar and that, in the highly noncommutative limit, correspond to the Maxwell effective action and its higher-derivative corrections. It is explicitly verified that the one-loop effective action is gauge invariant, as well as under discrete symmetries: parity, time reversal and charge conjugation.

1902.00263,hep-th,"Even at tree level, the first quantized string theory suffers from apparent short distance singularities associated with collision of vertex operators that prevent us from straightforward numerical computation of various quantities. Examples include string theory S-matrix for generic external momenta and computation of the spectrum of string theory under a marginal deformation of the world-sheet theory. The former requires us to define the S-matrix via analytic continuation or as limits of contour integrals in complexified moduli space, while the latter requires us to use an ultraviolet cut-off at intermediate steps. In contrast, string field theory does not suffer from such divergences. In this paper we show how string field theory can be used to generate an explicit algorithm for computing tree level amplitudes in any string theory that does not suffer from any short distance divergence from integration over the world-sheet variables. We also use string field theory to compute second order mass shift of string states under a marginal deformation without having to use any cut-off at intermediate steps.

For non-bound state particles the leading exponential finite-size corrections (F-terms) come from virtual particles traveling around the finite world. In these F-terms a specifically regulated infinite volume form factor is integrated for the momenta of the virtual particles.

We demonstrate the feasibility of such a test by directly integrating the most difficult of the two-loop topologies required. This integral, together with its rotated image, suffices to determine the simplest NMHV component amplitude: the unique component finite at this order. Although each of these integrals involve algebraic symbol alphabets, the combination contributing to this amplitude is---surprisingly---rational. We describe the steps involved in this analysis, which requires several novel tricks of loop integration and also a considerable degree of algebraic number theory.

This fully generalizes earlier observations in particular orbifolds of equation, the conifold and equation. The solution for any orbifold of a given parent theory follows from a universal structure in the infinite dimer in equation giving the covering space of the unit cell of the parent theory before orbifolding. The generator equation is realized as a shift in the dimer diagram, associated to the orbifold quantum symmetry; the action of equation is determined by equations describing a 1-form in the dimer graph in the unit cell of the parent theory with twisted boundary conditions; finally, equation is an element of the (mesonic and baryonic) non-anomalous Uequation symmetries, determined by geometric identities involving the elements of the dimer graph of the parent theory.

The black hole limit corresponds to a system where the microstates are approximately degenerate and equally likely, corresponding to the high temperature limit of the spin system. At the leading level of approximation, reconstruction of bulk physics implies that local probes of the black hole should exhibit free propagation and unitary local evolution. We test the conjecture that a particular mean field Hamiltonian provides such a local bulk Hamiltonian by numerically solving the exact Schrodinger equation and comparing the time evolution to the approximate mean field time values. We find excellent agreement between the two time evolutions for timescales smaller than the scrambling time. In earlier work, it was shown bulk evolution along comparable timeslices is spoiled by the presence of the curvature singularity, thus the matching found in the present work provides evidence of the success of this approach to interior holography. The numerical solutions also provide a useful testing ground for various measures of quantum chaos and global scrambling.

The perfect square term follows from the superspace geometry, being a square of the superspace torsion. The supercovariant equation of motion for gaugino on the non-Abelian Dp-brane also involves a supertorsion in agreement with the perfect square term in the action.",2019,[],6
1910.01135,hep-th,"As a refinement of the Swampland Distance Conjecture, we propose that a quantum gravitational theory in an infinite distance limit of its moduli space either decompactifies, or reduces to an asymptotically tensionless, weakly coupled string theory. We support our claim by classifying, as special cases, the behaviour of M-Theory and Type IIA string theory compactifications on Calabi-Yau three-folds at infinite distances in Kahler moduli space. The analysis comprises three parts: We first classify the possible infinite distance limits in the classical Kahler moduli space of a Calabi-Yau three-fold. Each such limit at finite volume is characterized by a universal fibration structure, for which the generic fiber shrinking in the limit is either an elliptic curve, a K3 surface, or an Abelian surface. In the second part we focus on M-Theory and investigate the nature of the towers of asymptotically massless states that arise from branes wrapped on the shrinking fibers. Depending on which of the three classes of fibrations are considered, we obtain decompactification to F-Theory, or a theory with a unique asymptotically tensionless, weakly coupled heterotic or Type II string, respectively. The latter probes a dual D-manifold which is in general non-geometric. In addition to the intrinsic string excitations, towers of states from M2-branes along non-contractible curves become light and correspond to further wrapping and winding modes of the tensionless heterotic or Type II string. In the third part of the analysis, we consider Type IIA string theory on Calabi-Yau three-folds and show that quantum effects obstruct taking finite volume infinite distance limits in the Kahler moduli space. The only possible infinite distance limit which is not a decompactification limit involves K3-fibrations with string scale fiber volume and gives rise to an emergent tensionless heterotic string.",2019,[],6

We focus on backgrounds with a large number of Killing vectors (namely, products of maximally symmetric spaces), without requiring supersymmetry (we do not turn on any background fields except the metric). LST is non-local so it is not obvious which spaces it can be defined on; we show that holography implies that the theory cannot be put on negatively curved spaces, but only on spaces with zero or positive curvature. For example, one cannot put LST on a product of an anti-de Sitter space times another space, without turning on extra background fields. On spaces with positive curvature, such as equation, equation, equation, etc., we typically find (for large equation) dual holographic backgrounds which are weakly coupled and weakly curved everywhere, so that they can be well-described by Type II supergravity. In some cases more than one smooth solution exists for LST on the same space, and they all contribute to the partition function. We also study the thermodynamical properties of LST compactified on spheres, finding the leading correction to the Hagedorn behavior of the spectrum, which is different on curved space than on flat space.

In this expansion, non-perturbative instanton contributions are present, and the equation duality invariance of correlation functions is manifest. Our results are based on a detailed analysis of the sphere partition function of the mass-deformed SYM theory, which was previously computed using supersymmetric localization. This partition function determines a certain integrated correlator in the undeformed equation SYM theory, which in turn constrains the four-point correlator at separated points. In a normalization where the two-point functions are proportional to equation and are independent of equation and equation, we find that the terms of order equation and equation in the large equation expansion of the four-point correlator are proportional to the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series equation and equation, respectively.

In this paper equation-covariance and supersymmetry are used to determine first-order differential equations on moduli space that relate the modular form coefficients of classes of BPS-protected maximal equation-violating interactions that arise at low orders in the low-energy expansion. These are the moduli-dependent coefficients of BPS interactions of the form equation in linearised approximation, where equation is the product of equation fields that has dimension equation with equation, and equation, equation or equation. These first-order equations imply that the coefficients satisfy equation-covariant Laplace eigenvalue equations on moduli space with solutions that contain information concerning perturbative and non-perturbative contributions to superstring amplitudes. For equation and equation there are two independent modular forms, one of which has a vanishing tree-level contribution.   The analysis of super-amplitudes for equation-violating processes involving arbitrary numbers of external fluctuations of the complex modulus leads to a diagrammatic derivation of the first-order differential relations and Laplace equations satisfied by the coefficient modular forms.

Initially, the coefficient of this gravitational Chern-Simons term appears to have the same ambiguity as the coefficient for the analogous term in QED.

This leads to some useful observations about a significant mixing of the standard NS-NS fluxes with the (non-)geometric fluxes on the mirror side. Further, using our equation-duality rules, we establish an explicit mapping among the equation-terms, equation-terms, tadpole conditions as well as the Bianchi identities of the two theories. Secondly, we propose what we call a set of ""axionic flux orbits"", which depend on all the axionic moduli and the fluxes.

As such, investigating how these vacuum states and energy behave in curved backgrounds is just natural and might provide important results in the near future. In this paper we revisit a model of the Casimir Effect in weak gravitational field background, which has been proposed and further generalized in the literature.

Indeed, this criterion, together with a unitary implementation of the symmetries of the equations of motion, leads to a unique equivalence class of Fock representations. In this work, we apply the procedure developed for fields in cosmological settings to analyze the quantization of a scalar field in the presence of an external electromagnetic classical field in a flat background. We find a natural Fock representation that admits a unitary implementation of the quantum field dynamics. It automatically allows to define a particle number density at all times in the evolution with the correct asymptotic behavior, when the electric field vanishes.

(2) the Higgs branch as a geometric space can in general be decomposed into two cones with nontrivial intersection, the baryonic and mesonic branches. To study the second point in detail we use the recently developed tool of magnetic quivers for five-brane webs, using the fact that the classical Higgs branch for theories with 8 supercharges does not change through dimensional reduction.

In the large black hole regime, we show that the convex hull condition degenerates to the requirement that a certain quartic form, constructed from the Wilson coefficients of the four-derivative effective operators, is everywhere positive. Using on-shell unitarity methods, we show that higher-derivative operators are renormalized at one-loop only if they generate local, on-shell matrix elements that are invariant tensors of the electromagnetic duality group equation. The one-loop logarithmic running of the four-derivative Wilson coefficients is calculated and shown to imply the positivity of the extremality form at some finite value of equation. This result generalizes a recently given argument by Charles, and shows that under the given assumptions the multi-charge Weak Gravity Conjecture is not a Swampland criterion.",2019,[],6

We develop new methods to evaluate exchange Witten diagrams, resolving some technical difficulties that prevent a straightforward application of the methods used in higher dimensions. We perform detailed calculations in the equation background. We find strong evidence that four-point tree-level correlators of KK modes of the tensor multiplets enjoy a hidden 6d conformal symmetry. The correlators can all be packaged into a single generating function, related to the 6d flat space superamplitude. This generalizes an analogous structure found in equation supergravity.",2019,[],6
1907.04040,hep-th,"A recently constructed limit of K3 has a long neck consisting of segments, each of which is a nilfold fibred over a line, that are joined together with Kaluza-Klein monopoles. The neck is capped at either end by a Tian-Yau space, which is non-compact, hyperkahler and asymptotic to a nilfold fibred over a line. We show that the type IIA string on this degeneration of K3 is dual to the type Iequation string, with the Kaluza-Klein monopoles dual to the D8-branes and the Tian-Yau spaces providing a geometric dual to the O8 orientifold planes. At strong coupling, each O8-plane can emit a D8-brane to give an O8equation plane, so that there can be up to 18 D8-branes in the type Iequation string. In the IIA dual, this phenomenon occurs at weak coupling and there can be up to 18 Kaluza-Klein monopoles in the dual geometry. We consider further duals in which the Kaluza-Klein monopoles are dualised to NS5-branes or exotic branes. A 3-torus with equation-flux can be realised in string theory as an NS5-brane wrapped on equation, with the 3-torus fibred over a line. T-dualising gives a 4-dimensional hyperkahler manifold which is a nilfold fibred over a line, which can be viewed as a Kaluza-Klein monopole wrapped on equation. Further T-dualities then give non-geometric spaces fibred over a line and can be regarded as wrapped exotic branes. These are all domain wall configurations, dual to the D8-brane. Type Iequation string theory is the natural home for D8-branes, and we dualise this to find string theory homes for each of these branes. The Kaluza-Klein monopoles arise in the IIA string on the degenerate K3. T-duals of this give exotic branes on non-geometric spaces.",2019,[],6
1904.06344,hep-th,"We systematically analyse weak coupling limits for 2-form tensor fields in the presence of gravity. Such limits are significant for testing various versions of the Weak Gravity and Swampland Distance Conjectures, and more broadly, the phenomenon of emergence. The weak coupling limits for 2-forms correspond to certain infinite-distance limits in the moduli space of string compactifications, where asymptotically tensionless, solitonic strings arise. These strings are identified as weakly coupled fundamental strings in a dual frame, which makes the idea of emergence manifest. Concretely we first consider weakly coupled tensor fields in six-dimensional compactifications of F-theory, where the arising tensionless strings play the role of dual weakly coupled heterotic strings. As the main part of this work, we consider certain infinite distance limits of Type IIB strings on K3 surfaces, for which we show that the asymptotically tensionless strings describe dual fundamental Type IIB strings, again on K3 surfaces. By contrast the analogous weak coupling limits of M-theory compactifications are found to correspond to an F-theory limit where an extra dimension emerges rather than tensionless strings. We comment on extensions of our findings to four-dimensional compactifications.",2019,[],6
1904.05905,hep-th,"We study propagation of a probe particle through a series of closely situated gravitational shocks. We argue that in any UV-complete theory of gravity the result does not depend on the shock ordering - in other words, coincident gravitational shocks commute. Shock commutativity leads to nontrivial constraints on low-energy effective theories. In particular, it excludes non-minimal gravitational couplings unless extra degrees of freedom are judiciously added. In flat space, these constraints are encoded in the vanishing of a certain ""superconvergence sum rule."" In AdS, shock commutativity becomes the statement that average null energy (ANEC) operators commute in the dual CFT. We prove commutativity of ANEC operators in any unitary CFT and establish sufficient conditions for commutativity of more general light-ray operators. Superconvergence sum rules on CFT data can be obtained by inserting complete sets of states between light-ray operators. In a planar 4d CFT, these sum rules express (a-c)/c in terms of the OPE data of single-trace operators.",2019,[],6

1905.11999,hep-th,"The usual methods for formulating and solving the quantum mechanics of a particle moving in a magnetic field respect neither locality nor any global symmetries which happen to be present. For example, Landau's solution for a particle moving in a uniform magnetic field in the plane involves choosing a gauge in which neither translation nor rotation invariance are manifest. We show that locality can be made manifest by passing to a redundant description in which the particle moves on a equation-principal bundle over the original configuration space and that symmetry can be made manifest by passing to a corresponding central extension of the original symmetry group by equation. With the symmetry manifest, one can attempt to solve the problem by using harmonic analysis and we provide a number of examples where this succeeds. One is a solution of the Landau problem in an arbitrary gauge (with either translation invariance or the full Euclidean group manifest). Another example is the motion of a fermionic rigid body, which can be formulated and solved in a manifestly local and symmetric way via a flat connection on the non-trivial equation-central extension of the configuration space equation given by equation.",2019,[],6

We first address this problem in toroidal/orbifold type IIA vacua with metric fluxes, corresponding to compactifications in twisted tori, both from the 4d and 10d points of view. We show how the naive application of the effective 4d theory leads to results which violate the AdS distance conjecture, in a class of equation supersymmetric models which have a 10d lifting to a compactification on equation. We show how using KK scales properly modified by the compact metric leads to no separation of scales with equation, with equation a numerical constant independent of fluxes. This applies with no need to keep non-leading fluxes fixed. We also consider a class of IIB models with non-geometric fluxes in which the effective field theory analysisseems to lead to a naive separation of scales and a violation of the AdS distance conjecture. It has a T-dual which again may be understood as a 10d type IIA theory compactified on equation. In this geometric dual one again observes that the strong AdS distance conjecture is obeyed with equation, if one takes into account the curvature in the internal space. These findings seem to suggest that all toroidal/orbifold models with fluxes in this class obey equation with equation a flux-independent numerical constant.",2019,[],6

The key element of the derivation is the existence of a novel class of polynomial Sommerfeld integrals. The emerging duality of quantum statistical and geometrical approaches is explicitly checked at temperatures equation above or equal to the Unruh temperature equation. Treating the acceleration as an imaginary part of the chemical potential allows for an analytical continuation to temperatures equation .

By considering methods of analytic Galoisian non-integrability on appropriate geodesics of the Hamiltonian system we algebraically constrain the particle masses at fixed time, such that integrability is allowed. Through our equivalence this explicitly constrains the masses of the excited spectrum of the dual 2-dim theory in such a way to imply the S-matrix factorization and no particle production. In particular, the integrability of the classical particle system, implies the factorization of the S-matrix in the dual quantum 2-dim theory. Our proposal provides also non-trivial evidence without any assumptions, on the connection between integrability and S-matrix factorization for large class of theories with interactions that break Lorentz invariance.",2019,[],6
1909.02003,hep-th,"We demonstrate that loop integrands of (super-)gravity scattering amplitudes possess surprising properties in the ultraviolet (UV) region. In particular, we study the scaling of multi-particle unitarity cuts for asymptotically large momenta and expose an improved UV behavior of four-dimensional cuts through seven loops as compared to standard expectations. For N=8 supergravity, we show that the improved large momentum scaling combined with the behavior of the integrand under BCFW deformations of external kinematics uniquely fixes the loop integrands in a number of non-trivial cases. In the integrand construction, all scaling conditions are homogeneous. Therefore, the only required information about the amplitude is its vanishing at particular points in momentum space. This homogeneous construction gives indirect evidence for a new geometric picture for graviton amplitudes similar to the one found for planar N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. We also show how the behavior at infinity is related to the scaling of tree-level amplitudes under certain multi-line chiral shifts which can be used to construct new recursion relations.",2019,[],6

In particular, we study its compactifications to four dimensions on a smooth genus-equation Riemann surface with non-trivial flavor flux, yielding a family of 4d CFTs. By tracking the M-theory origin of the global symmetries of the 4d CFTs, we detect the emergence of an accidental symmetry and the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a equation generator. These effects are visible from geometric considerations and not apparent from the point of view of the compactification of the 6d field theory. These phenomena leave an imprint on the 't Hooft anomaly polynomial of the 4d CFTs, which is obtained from recently developed anomaly inflow methods in M-theory. In the large-equation limit, we identify the gravity dual of the 4d setups to be a class of smooth equation solutions first discussed by Gauntlett-Martelli-Sparks-Waldram.

In this picture, a line element would arise as a statistical average of how frequently particles interact, through an individual rate equation and spatially interconnecting rates equation. The question is if space-time can be modelled consistently in this way. The ansatz would be opposite to the standard treatment of space-time as insensitive to altered physics at event horizons (disrupted propagation of information) but by extension relate to the connection of space-time to entanglement (interactions) through the gauge/gravity duality. We make a first, rough analysis of the implications this type of quantization would have on the classical structure of flat space-time, and of what would be required of the interactions.

The solution to the limit shape equations gives the Seiberg-Witten geometry of the low energy effective theory.

1905.10487,hep-th,"Some quantum field theories show, in a fundamental or an effective manner, an alternative between a loss of duality for algebras of operators corresponding to complementary regions, or a loss of additivity. In this latter case, the algebra contains some operator that is not generated locally, in the former, the entropies of complementary regions do not coincide. Typically, these features are related to the incompleteness of the operator content of the theory, or, in other words, to the existence of superselection sectors. We review some aspects of the mathematical literature on superselection sectors aiming attention to the physical picture and focusing on the consequences for entanglement entropy (EE). For purposes of clarity, the whole discussion is divided into two parts according to the superselection sectors classification: The present part I is devoted to superselection sectors arising from global symmetries, and the forthcoming part II will consider those arising from local symmetries. Under this perspective, here restricted to global symmetries, we study in detail different cases such as models with finite and Lie group symmetry as well as with spontaneous symmetry breaking or excited states. We illustrate the general results with simple examples. As an important application, we argue the features of holographic entanglement entropy correspond to a picture of a sub-theory with a large number of superselection sectors and suggest some ways in which this identification could be made more precise.",2019,[],6

This constitutes a new level of precision in the holographic dictionary and paves the way for the exact matching of scheme dependent quantities, such as holographic beta functions, with field theory computations. Furthermore, the renormalization procedure identifies a local source field which satisfies the equations of motion along renormalization group flows, resolving a long-standing puzzle regarding the Wilsonian coupling in holography. This identification of the source field also provides new insight into field theories deformed by marginal operators, which have been traditionally difficult to analyze due to altered bulk asymptotics. Finally, we demonstrate a new relation equating the analyticity of the holographic beta function to the absence of conformal anomalies, and conjecture that the conformal anomaly should vanish in the UV for all holographic constructions.",2019,[],6

These D3-branes have an AdSequation near horizon geometry where equation is a discrete subgroup of equation. We compute the central charges and levels of the 2d SCFTs both in the microscopic picture and from six-dimensional equation supergravity.

In particular, we use a non-local inverse picture-changing operator for the constraint on the R-R string field, which seems to be inevitable due to the compatibility of the extra constraint with the closed string constraints. The natural symplectic form in the restricted Hilbert space gives a non-local kinetic action for the R-R sector, but it correctly provides the propagator expected from the first-quantized formulation. Extending the prescription previously obtained for the heterotic string field theory, we give a construction of general type II superstring products, which realizes a cyclic L-infinity structure, and thus provides a gauge-invariant action based on the homotopy algebraic formulation. Three typical four-string amplitudes derived from the constructed string field theory are demonstrated to agree with those in the first-quantized formulation.

In the first part of this thesis we study the interparticle potentials generated by the interactions between spin-1/2 sources that are mediated by spin-1 particles in the limit of low momentum transfer. We investigate different representations of spin-1 particle to see how it modifies the profiles of the interparticle potentials and we also include in our analysis all types of couplings between fermionic currents and the mediator boson. The spin- and velocity-dependent interparticle potentials that we obtain can be used to explain effects possibly associated to new macroscopic forces such as modifications of the inverse-square law and possible spin-gravity coupling effects.

In these models the right-handed sneutrino is a good DM candidate whose dark matter properties are in agreement with the present relic density and current experimental limits on the DM-nucleon scattering cross section. In order to see how heavy can the RH sneutrino be as a viable thermal dark matter candidate we explore its DM properties in the parameter region that minimize its relic density via resonance effects and thus allows it to be a heavier DM particle.

We generalize recent studies on relations among toric geometry, variational principles, and black hole entropy to the case of AdSequation, where equation is a fibration of toric Sasaki-Einstein manifold equation over a two-dimensional Riemann surface equation. The nine-dimensional variational problem is given in terms of an entropy functional. In order to illustrate the computations as explicitly as possible, we consider cases where either only mesonic or baryonic fluxes are turned on. By employing the operator counting method, we calculate the equation free energy and the topologically twisted index equation at large-equation. The result for equation, it turns out, can be also obtained from the variational principle of the entropy functional with mesonic fluxes. We also study asymptotically AdSequation black holes which are magnetically charged with respect to the vector field in the Betti multiplet.

This ratio serves as a useful expansion parameter; its power counts the number of stress tensors in the multi-stress tensor operators which contribute to the four-point function. In the cross-channel the four-point function is determined by the OPE coefficients and anomalous dimensions of the heavy-light double-trace operators.

The reduction eliminates the scalar gauge mode, renders the theory manifestly gauge invariant and the symplectic form non-singular. In this work we show that while the predictions of the reduced theory coincide with those of conventional QED for scattering events, it is experimentally distinguishable. Quantum interference of charges traveling along time-like Wilson loops that encircle (but remain clear of) electric fields is sensitive to a relative phase shift due to an interaction with the scalar potential. This is the archetypal electric Aharonov-Bohm effect and does not exist in the reduced theory. Despite its prediction over six decades ago, and in contrast to its well known magnetic counterpart, this electric Aharonov-Bohm phenomenon has never been observed.

We comment on the instability of this state by the presence of tachyon modes and the apparent violation of the refined dS conjecture at the minimum of the tachyon potential. The conjecture seems to be valid once we take into account that discrete K-theory charge vanishes.

The mirrors in question are Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds, and for mirrors to O(k) gauge theories, the critical loci of the mirror superpotential often intersect fixed-point loci, so that to count vacua, one must take into account twisted sector contributions. This is a technical novelty relative to mirrors of gauge theories with connected gauge groups, for which critical loci do not intersect fixed-point loci and so no orbifold twisted sector contributions are pertinent. The vacuum computations turn out to be a rather intricate test of the proposed mirrors, in particular as untwisted sector states in the mirror to one theory are often exchanged with twisted sector states in the mirror to the dual.

We find that for small equation and equation, the evolutions of the HEE and the HC is a continuous function. When equation or equation is tuned larger, the discontinuity emerges, which could not observed in the neutral AdSequation backgrounds. We show that, the emergence of this discontinuity is a universal behavior in the charged massive BTZ theory. With the increase of graviton mass, on the other hand, no emergence of the discontinuity behavior for any small equation and equation could be observed. We also show that the evolution of the HEE and HC both become stable at later times, and equation speeds up reaching to the stability during the evolution of the system. Moreover, we show that equation decreases the final stable value of HEE but raises the stable value of HC. Additionally, contrary to the usual picture in the literature that the evolution of HC has only one peak, for big enough widths, we show that graviton mass could introduce two peaks during the evolution.

1905.03926,hep-th,"In this paper we study the quantisation of scalar field theory in equation-deformed space-time. Using a quantisation scheme that use only field equations, we derive the quantisation rules for deformed scalar theory, starting from the equation-deformed equations of motion. This scheme allows two choices; (i)a deformed commutation relation between the field and its conjugate which leads to usual oscillator algebra, (ii) an undeformed commutation relation between field and its conjugate leading to a deformed oscillator algebra. This deformed oscillator algebra is used to derive modification to Unruh effect in the equation-space-time.",2019,[],6
1912.04807,hep-th,"We study supersymmetric equation, equation solutions in seven-dimensional maximal gauged supergravity with equation and equation gauge groups. These gauged supergravities are consistent truncations of eleven-dimensional supergravity and type IIB theory on equation and equation, respectively. Apart from recovering the previously known equation solutions in equation gauge group, we find novel classes of equation, equation and equation solutions in non-compact equation gauge group together with a class of equation solutions in equation gauge group. In equation gauge group, we extensively study holographic RG flow solutions interpolating from the equation supersymmetric equation vacuum to the equation fixed points and singular geometries in the form of curved domain walls with equation slices. In many cases, the singularities are physically acceptable and can be interpreted as non-conformal phases of equation-dimensional SCFTs obtained from twisted compactifications of equation SCFT in six dimensions. In equation and equation gauge groups, we give a large number of RG flows between the new equation fixed points and curved domain walls while, in equation gauge group, RG flows interpolating between asymptotically locally flat domain walls and curved domain walls are given.",2019,[],6
1901.00655,hep-th,"We have shown the existence of self-dual solitons in a type of generalized Chern-Simons baby Skyrme model where the generalized function (depending only in the Skyrme field) is coupled to the sigma-model term. The consistent implementation of the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) formalism requires the generalizing function becomes the superpotential defining properly the self-dual potential. Thus, we have obtained a topological energy lower-bound (Bogomol'nyi bound) and the self-dual equations satisfied by the fields saturating such a bound. The Bogomol'nyi bound being proportional to the topological charge of the Skyrme field is quantized whereas the total magnetic flux is not. Such as expected in a Chern-Simons model the total magnetic flux and the total electrical charge are proportional to each other. Thus, by considering the superpotential a well-behaved function in the whole target space we have shown the existence of three types of self-dual solutions: compacton solitons, soliton solutions whose tail decays following an exponential-law equation (equation), and solitons having a power-law decay equation (equation). The profiles of the two last solitons can exhibit a compactonlike behavior. The self-dual equations have been solved numerically and we have depicted the soliton profiles, commenting on the main characteristics exhibited by them.",2019,[],6
1905.08815,hep-th,We explore the quantum chaos of the coadjoint orbit action. We study quantum fluctuation around a saddle point to evaluate the soft mode contribution to the out-of-time-ordered correlator. We show that the stability condition of the semi-classical analysis of the coadjoint orbit found by Witten (1988) leads to the upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent which is identical to the bound on chaos proven in arXiv:1503.01409. The bound is saturated by the coadjoint orbit equation while the other stable orbit equation where the equation is broken to equation has non-maximal Lyapunov exponent.,2019,[],6
1911.00419,hep-th,"Exotic duality suggests a link between gauge theories for differential p-forms and tensor fields of mixed symmetry [D-2,p] in D spacetime dimensions. On the other hand, standard Hodge duality relates p-form to (D-p-2)-form gauge potentials by exchanging their field equations and Bianchi identities. Following the methodology and the recent proposal of Henneaux, Lekeu and Leonard that the double dual of the free graviton is algebraically related to the original graviton and does not provide a new, independent description of the gravitational field, we examine the status of exotic duality for p-forms. We find that the exotic dual is algebraically related to the standard dual of a differential form and therefore they provide equivalent descriptions as free fields. Introducing sources then leads to currents being proportional. This relation is extended in a straightforward way for higher exotic duals of the mixed symmetry type [D-2,...,D-2,p].",2019,[],6

1906.09053,hep-th,"The rules for Yang-Baxter (YB) deformation for a generic Green-Schwarz string sigma model has been obtained recently. We show that the deformation can be described through the action of a coordinate dependent equation matrix on the target space fields both in the NS-NS and the RR sectors, generalizing previous results. This enables us to show that the YB deformed fields can be regarded as duality twisted fields in the context of Gauged Double Field Theory (GDFT). We compute the fluxes associated with the twist and show that the conditions on the R-matrix determining the YB deformation give rise to conditions for the fluxes on the GDFT side. More precisely, we show that YB deformation is a process which takes a solution of DFT with geometric flux associated with the isometry group equation and deforms it to another solution of DFT with vanishing R-flux and non-vanishing Q-flux given by the structure constants of the dual Lie algebra determined by the R-matrix. We also show that the non-unimodularity of the R-matrix forces the generalized dilaton field to pick up a linear dependence on the winding type coordinates of DFT, implying that the corresponding target space fields satisfy the field equations of DFT in the generalized supergravity frame. This provides a new perspective on the relation between the non-unimodularity of the R-matrix, the trace of the Q-flux and the generalized supergravity equations.",2019,[],6

1912.07494,hep-th,In a recent letter we suggested a natural generalization of the flat-space spinor-helicity formalism in four dimensions to anti-de Sitter space. In the present paper we give some technical details that were left implicit previously. For lower-spin fields we also derive potentials associated with the previously found plane wave solutions for field strengths. We then employ these potentials to evaluate some three-point amplitudes. This analysis illustrates a typical computation of an amplitude without internal lines in our formalism.,2019,[],6

1902.04201,hep-th,"We study the abelian M5 brane on equation. From the spectrum we extract a series expansion for the heat kernel. In particular we determine the normalization for the coefficient equation in the M5 brane conformal anomaly. When we compare our result with what one gets by computing the Hadamard-Minakshisundaram-DeWitt-Seeley coefficients from local curvature invariants on equation, we first find a mismatch of one unit. This mismatch is due to an overcounting of one zero mode. After subtracting this contribution, we finally find agreement. We perform dimensional reduction along a singular circle fiber to five dimensions where we find the conformal anomaly vanishes.",2019,[],6
1906.11473,hep-th,"At high energy densities, fivebranes are populated by a Hagedorn phase of so-called ""little strings"", whose statistical mechanics underlies black fivebrane thermodynamics. A particular limit of this phase yields BTZ black holes in equation, leading us to the idea that in this context fuzzballs and highly excited little strings are one and the same. We explore these ideas through an analysis of D-brane probes of fivebrane supertube backgrounds. String theory dynamics on these backgrounds is described by an exactly solvable null-gauged WZW model. We develop the formalism of null gauging on worldsheets with boundaries, and find that D-branes wrapping topology at the bottom of the supertube throat are avatars of the ""long string"" structure that dominates the thermodynamics of the black hole regime, appearing here as excitations of supertubes lying near but slightly outside the black hole regime.",2019,[],6

1901.00840,hep-th,"Techniques based on equation-particle irreducible effective actions can be used to study systems where perturbation theory does not apply. The main advantage, relative to other non-perturbative continuum methods, is that the hierarchy of integral equations that must be solved truncates at the level of the action, and no additional approximations are needed. The main problem with the method is renormalization, which until now could only be done at the lowest (equation=2) level. In this paper we show how to obtain renormalized results from an equation-particle irreducible effective action at any order. We consider a symmetric scalar theory with quartic coupling in four dimensions and show that the 4 loop 4-particle-irreducible calculation can be renormalized using a renormalization group method. The calculation involves one bare mass and one bare coupling constant which are introduced at the level of the Lagrangian, and cannot be done using any known method by introducing counterterms.",2019,[],6

1912.03859,hep-th,"In this paper, by performing a general Kaluza-Klein (KK) decomposition, we obtain a gauge invariant effective action for a bulk massless equation-form field on a equation-brane with codimension two. There appear four types of KK modes: two equation-forms and one equation-form in addtion to the ordinary equation-form, which are essential for the gauge invariance. Due to the two extra dimensions, we find eight Schrodinger-like equations for the four modes and their mass spectra are closely related. Moreover, via this decomposition mechanism, the Hodge duality in the bulk naturally induces four coupled dualities on the brane, which guarantees that the physical equavalence of bulk dual fields is preserved under the dimensional reduction.",2019,[],6

1907.01778,hep-th,"We study equation vacua within matter-coupled equation gauged supergravity in the embedding tensor formalism. We derive a set of conditions for the existence of equation solutions by using a simple ansatz for solving the extremization and positivity of the scalar potential. We find two classes of gauge groups that lead to equation vacua. One of them consists of gauge groups of the form equation with equation being a compact group and equation a non-compact group with equation subgroup and dynonically gauged. These gauge groups are the same as those giving rise to maximally supersymmetric equation vacua. The equation and equation vacua arise from different coupling ratios between equation and equation factors. Another class of gauge groups is given by equation with equation, equation and equation dyonically gauged. We explicitly check that all known equation vacua in equation gauged supergravity satisfy the aforementioned conditions, hence the two classes of gauge groups can accommodate all the previous results on equation vacua in a simple framework. Accordingly, the results provide a new approach for finding equation vacua. In addition, relations between the embedding tensors for gauge groups admitting equation and equation vacua are studied, and a new gauge group, equation, with a equation vacuum is found by applying these relations to equation gauge group in five dimensions.",2019,[],6

Blow up modes of orbifold singularities can be considered as coordinates of complexified Kahler moduli space. Quiver diagrams are used for discribing D-branes near orbifold point. In this case it is possible to calculate Euler character defined through equation groups and coherent sheaves equation over projective space, which are representations of orbifold space after blowing up procedure.
