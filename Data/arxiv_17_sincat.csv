1710.08127,astro-ph,"The generation of turbulence at magnetized shocks and its subsequent interaction with the latter is a key question of plasma- and high-energy astrophysics. This paper presents two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a fast shock front interacting with incoming upstream perturbations, described as harmonic entropy or fast magnetosonic waves, both in the relativistic and the sub-relativistic regimes. We discuss how the disturbances are transmitted into downstream turbulence and we compare the observed response for small amplitude waves to a recent linear calculation. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of a resonant response of the corrugation amplitude when the group velocity of the outgoing downstream fast mode matches the velocity of the shock front. We also present simulations of large amplitude waves to probe the non-linear regime.",17,[],1
1709.02186,astro-ph,"In this work, we reinvestigate the electron fraction equation and electron Fermi energy equation of neutron stars, based on our previous work of Li et al.(2016), in which we firstly deduced a special solution to equation, and then obtained several useful analytical formulae for equation and matter density equation within classical models and the relativistic mean field(RMF) theory using numerically fitting. The advantages of this work include the following aspects:(1) The linear functions are substituted for the nonlinear exponential functions used in the previous work. This method may be more simple, and closer to realistic equation of state\,(EoS) of a neutron star(NS), because there are linear or quasi-linear relationships between number fractions of leptons and matter density, which can be seen by solving NS EoS; (2)we introduce a dimensionless variable equation\,(equation, equation is the standard saturated nuclear density), which greatly reduces the scope of the fitting coefficients;(3)we present numerical errors including absolute and relative deviations between the data and fit. By numerically simulating, we have obtained several analytical formulae for equation and equation for both APR98 and RMF models. Combining these analytical formulae with the special solution, we can calculate the value of equation for any given matter density. Since equation and equation are important in assessing cooling rate of a NS and the possibility of kaon/pion condensation in the NS interior, this study could be useful in the future study on the thermal evolution of a NS.",17,[],1
1705.05733,astro-ph,"Spiral arms are the most singular features in disc galaxies. These structures can exhibit different patterns, namely grand design and flocculent arms, with easily distinguishable characteristics. However, their origin and the mechanisms shaping them are unclear. The overall role of spirals in the chemical evolution of disc galaxies is another unsolved question. In particular, it has not been fully explored if the \hii\,regions of spiral arms present different properties from those located in the interarm regions. Here we analyse the radial oxygen abundance gradient of the arm and interarm star forming regions of 63 face-on spiral galaxies using CALIFA Integral Field Spectroscopy data. We focus the analysis on three characteristic parameters of the profile: slope, zero-point, and scatter. The sample is morphologically separated into flocculent versus grand design spirals and barred versus unbarred galaxies. We find subtle but statistically significant differences between the arm and interarm distributions for flocculent galaxies, suggesting that the mechanisms generating the spiral structure in these galaxies may be different to those producing grand design systems, for which no significant differences are found. We also find small differences in barred galaxies, not observed in unbarred systems, hinting that bars may affect the chemical distribution of these galaxies but not strongly enough as to be reflected in the overall abundance distribution. In light of these results, we propose bars and flocculent structure as two distinct mechanisms inducing differences in the abundance distribution between arm and interarm star forming regions.",17,[],1
1705.07554,astro-ph,"The hypothesis of a recent origin of Saturn's rings and its mid-sized moons is actively debated. It was suggested that a proto-Rhea and a proto-Dione might have collided recently, giving birth to the modern system of mid-sized moons. It is also suggested that the rapid viscous spreading of the debris may have implanted mass inside Saturn's Roche limit, giving birth to the modern Saturn's ring system. However, this scenario has been only investigated in very simplified way for the moment. This paper investigates it in detail to assess its plausibility by using equation-body simulations and analytical arguments. When the debris disk is dominated by its largest remnant, equation-body simulations show that the system quickly re-accrete into a single satellite without significant spreading. On the other hand, if the disk is composed of small particles, analytical arguments suggest that the disk experiences dynamical evolutions in three steps. The disk starts significantly excited after the impact and collisional damping dominates over the viscous spreading. After the system flattens, the system can become gravitationally unstable when particles are smaller than equation 100 m. However, the particles grow faster than spreading. Then, the system becomes gravitationally stable again and accretion continues at a slower pace, but spreading is inhibited. Therefore, the debris is expected to re-accrete into several large bodies. In conclusion, our results show that such a scenario may not form the today's ring system. In contrast, our results suggest that today's mid-sized moons are likely re-accreted from such a catastrophic event.",17,[],1
1706.03289,astro-ph,"We present BVRI photometry of supernova (SN) 2016coj in NGC 4125 from equation days before to equation days after its equation-band maximum light. Our light curves and color curves suggest that this event belongs to the ""normal"" class of type Ia SNe, with a decline rate parameter equation, and that it suffers little extinction. Adopting a distance modulus to its host galaxy of equation mag, we compute extinction-corrected peak absolute magnitudes of equation, equation, equation, and equation. The explosion occurred close enough to the nucleus of NGC 4125 to hinder the measurement of its brightness. We describe our methods to reduce the effect of such host-galaxy contamination, but it is clear that our latest values suffer from systematic bias.",17,[],1
1712.04110,astro-ph,"The galaxies with photometric redshifts observed in a close angular proximity might be either projection coincidences, strongly lensed images of the same galaxy, or separate galaxies that are in a stage of merging. We search for the groups of galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF09) in equation and equation drop-out samples. We find no close pairs among 50 galaxies in the equation sample, while in the equation sample we find that 6 out of 22 galaxies have a companion within equation (3 pairs). Adopting a numerical simulation and performing forward modeling we show that even though mergers are unlikely to have such a high fraction, the projection coincidences and the strong lensing are even less likely mechanisms to account for all of three pairs. Alternatively, there is a possibility of the contamination in the drop-out catalog from lower redshifts, which potentially can account for all of the groups. Finally, we make projection on the sensitivity to mergers of the James Webb Space Telescope, and discuss the possible applications of the high-redshift merging galaxies for decreasing cosmic variance effect on the luminosity function and for improving the accuracy of photometric redshifts in general.",17,[],1
1711.01275,astro-ph,"The late-time light curves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), observed equation days after explosion, present the possibility of a new diagnostic for SN Ia progenitor and explosion models. First, however, we must discover what physical process (or combination of processes) leads to the slow-down of the late-time light curve relative to a pure equationCo decay, as observed in SNe 2011fe, 2012cg, and 2014J. We present Hubble Space Telescope observations of SN 2015F, taken equation days past maximum light. Unlike those of the three other SNe Ia, the light curve of SN 2015F remains consistent with being powered solely by the radioactive decay of equationCo. We fit the light curves of these four SNe Ia in a consistent manner and measure possible correlations between the light curve stretch - a proxy for the intrinsic luminosity of the SN - and the parameters of the physical model used in the fit (e.g., the mass ratio of equationCo and equationCo produced in the explosion, or the time at which freeze-out sets in). We propose a new, late-time Phillips-like correlation between the stretch of the SNe and the shape of their late-time light curves, which we parametrize as the difference between their pseudo-bolometric luminosities at 600 and 900 days: equation. This model-independent correlation provides a new way to test which physical process lies behind the slow-down of SN Ia light curves equation days after explosion, and, ultimately, fresh constraints on the various SN Ia progenitor and explosion models.",17,[],1
1710.11552,astro-ph,"We present a seismological method to probe the solar atmosphere above sunspot umbrae with three-minute oscillations. Our technique allows us to estimate both the vertical distance between atmospheric layers and the wave-propagation speed without specifying any extra parameters, in particular, the phase speed of the wave or the emission formation heights. Our method uses the projected wave paths of slow MHD waves propagating through the atmospheric layers of different heights and guided by the magnetic field. The length of the projected wave path depends upon the distance between the layers and the inclination angle of the magnetic field with respect to the line of sight, allowing us to estimate the distance between the layers from measured projected wave paths and the local magnetic-field vector. In turn, the wave-propagation delay registered at different heights allows for the calculation of the phase speed. We estimated the vertical distance between the emission layers at the temperature minimum (1600 \AA) and transition region (304 \AA), as well as the average phase speed above the sunspot umbrae, for three active regions. We found that the distance between the 1600 \AA emission layer and the transition region above the sunspot umbrae lies in the range of 500 -- 800 km. The average phase speed between these layers was found to be about 30 km/s giving the sound speed of 6 km/s. The temperature between the layers has been roughly estimated as 3000 K and corresponds to the region of the temperature minimum. The results obtained are consistent with the semiempirical model of the sunspot umbrae atmosphere by Fontenla, 2009.   The manuscript has been accepted for publication in Solar Physics journal.",17,[],1
1704.04834,astro-ph,"At early stages of stellar evolution young stars show powerful jets and/or outflows that interact with protoplanetary discs and their surroundings. Despite the scarce knowledge about the interaction of jets and/or outflows with discs, spectroscopic studies based on Herschel and ISO data suggests that gas shocked by jets and/or outflows can be traced by far-IR (FIR) emission in certain sources. We want to provide a consistent catalogue of selected atomic ([OI] and [CII]) and molecular (CO, OH, and HequationO) line fluxes observed in the FIR, separate and characterize the contribution from the jet and the disc to the observed line emission, and place the observations in an evolutionary picture. The atomic and molecular FIR (60-190 equation) line emission of protoplanetary discs around 76 T Tauri stars located in Taurus are analysed. The observations were carried out within the Herschel key programme Gas in Protoplanetary Systems (GASPS). The spectra were obtained with the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS). The sample is first divided in outflow and non-outflow sources according to literature tabulations. With the aid of archival stellar/disc and jet/outflow tracers and model predictions (PDRs and shocks), correlations are explored to constrain the physical mechanisms behind the observed line emission. The much higher detection rate of emission lines in outflow sources and the compatibility of line ratios with shock model predictions supports the idea of a dominant contribution from the jet/outflow to the line emission, in particular at earlier stages of the stellar evolution as the brightness of FIR lines depends in large part on the specific evolutionary stage.

1707.02376,astro-ph,"At TeV energies and above gamma rays can induce electromagnetic cascades, whose charged component is sensitive to intervening intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMFs). When interpreting gamma-ray measurements in the energy range between a few GeV and hundreds of TeV, one has to carefully account for effects due to IGMFs, which depend on their strength and power spectrum. Therefore, gamma-ray-induced electromagnetic cascades can be used as probes of cosmic magnetism, since their arrival distribution as well as spectral and temporal properties can provide unique information about IGMFs, whose origin and properties are currently poorly understood. In this contribution we present an efficient three-dimensional Monte Carlo code for simulations of gamma-ray propagation. We focus on the effects of different configurations of IGMFs, in particular magnetic helicity and the power spectrum of stochastic fields, on the morphology of the arrival directions of gamma rays, and discuss the prospects for detecting pair haloes around distant blazars.",17,[],1
1709.03750,astro-ph,"We present the abundances of Li, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, and Ba in a wide metallicity range (equation [Fe/H] equation). Using the differential technique allowed us to obtain an unprecedented low level of scatter in our analysis, with standard deviations as low as 0.05 dex, and mean errors as low as 0.05 dex for [X/Fe]. By expanding our metallicity range with precise abundances from other works, we were able to precisely constrain Galactic chemical evolution models in a wide metallicity range (equation [Fe/H] equation). The agreements and discrepancies found are key for further improvement of both models and observations. We also show that the LTE analysis of Cr II is a much more reliable source of abundance for chromium, as Cr I has important NLTE effects. These effects can be clearly seen when we compare the observed abundances of Cr I and Cr II with GCE models. While Cr I has a clear disagreement between model and observations, Cr II is very well modeled. We confirm tight increasing trends of Co and Zn toward lower metallicities, and a tight flat evolution of Ni relative to Fe. Our results strongly suggest inhomogeneous enrichment from hypernovae. Our precise stellar parameters results in a low star-to-star scatter (equation dex) in the Li abundances of our sample, with a mean value about equation dex lower than the prediction from standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis; we also study the relation between lithium depletion and stellar mass, but it is difficult to assess a correlation due to the limited mass range. We find two blue straggler stars, based on their very depleted Li abundances. One of them shows intriguing abundance anomalies, including a possible zinc enhancement, suggesting that zinc may have been also produced by a former AGB companion.",17,[],1
1709.08298,astro-ph,"We introduce a equation Doppler and aberration transformation kernel for the harmonic multipoles of a general cosmological observable with spin weight equation, Doppler weight equation and arbitrary frequency spectrum. In the context of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) studies, the frequency-dependent formalism allows to correct for the motion-induced aberration and Doppler effects on individual frequency maps with different masks. It also permits to deboost background radiations with non-blackbody frequency spectra, like extragalactic foregrounds and CMB spectra with primordial spectral distortions. The formalism can also be used to correct individual E and B polarization modes and account for motion-induced E/B mixing of polarized observables with equation at different frequencies.   We apply the generalized aberration kernel on polarized and unpolarized CMB specific intensity at 100 and 217 GHz and show that the motion-induced effects typically increase with the frequency of observation. In all-sky CMB experiments, the frequency-dependence of the motion-induced effects for a blackbody spectrum are overall negligible. However in a cut-sky analysis, ignoring the frequency dependence can lead to percent level error in the polarized and unpolarized power spectra over all angular scales. In the specific cut-sky used in our analysis (equation), and for the dipole-inferred velocity equation typically attributed to our peculiar motion, the Doppler and aberration effects can change polarized and unpolarized power spectra of specific intensity in the CMB rest frame by equation, but we find the polarization cross-leakage between E and B modes to be negligible.",17,[],1
1704.02256,astro-ph,"We study the alignment of irregular dust grains by mechanical torques due to the drift of grains through the ambient gas. We first calculate mechanical torques (MATs) resulting from specular reflection of gas atoms for seven irregular shapes: one shape of mirror symmetry, three highly irregular shapes (HIS), and three weakly irregular shapes (WIS). We find that the grain with mirror symmetry experiences negligible MATs due to its mirror-symmetry geometry. Three highly irregular shapes can produce strong MATs which exhibit some generic properties as radiative torques, while three weakly irregular shapes produce less efficient MATs. We then study grain alignment by MATs for the different angles between the drift velocity and the ambient magnetic field, for paramagnetic and superparamagnetic grains assuming efficient internal relaxation. We find that for HIS grains, MATs can align subsonically drifting grains in the same way as radiative torques, with low-J and high-J attractors. For supersonic drift, MATs can align grains with low-J and high-J attractors, analogous to radiative alignment by anisotropic radiation. We also show that the joint action of MATs and magnetic torques in grains with iron inclusions can lead to perfect MAT alignment. Our results point out the potential importance of MAT alignment for HIS grains predicted by the analytical model of Lazarian \& Hoang (2007b), although more theoretical and observational studies are required due to uncertainty in the shape of interstellar grains. We outline astrophysical environments where MAT alignment is potentially important.",17,[],1
1710.07295,astro-ph,"Radiation in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray holds clues to the location of the missing baryons, the energetics in stellar feedback processes, and the cosmic enrichment history. Additionally, EUV and soft X-ray photons help determine the ionization state of most intergalactic and circumgalactic metals, shaping the rate at which cosmic gas cools. Unfortunately, this band is extremely difficult to probe observationally due to absorption from the Galaxy. In this paper, we model the contributions of various sources to the cosmic EUV and soft X-ray backgrounds. We bracket the contribution from (1) quasars, (2) X-ray binaries, (3) hot interstellar gas, (4) circumgalactic gas, (5) virialized gas, and (6) supersoft sources, developing models that extrapolate into these bands using both empirical and theoretical inputs. While quasars are traditionally assumed to dominate these backgrounds, we discuss the substantial uncertainty in their contribution. Furthermore, we find that hot intrahalo gases likely emit an O(1) fraction of this radiation at low redshifts, and that interstellar and circumgalactic emission potentially contribute tens of percent to these backgrounds at all redshifts. We estimate that uncertainties in the angular-averaged background intensity impact the ionization corrections for common circumgalactic and intergalactic metal absorption lines by ~0.3-1 dex, and we show that local emissions are comparable to the cosmic background only at rprox = 10-100 kpc from Milky Way-like galaxies.",17,[],1

1712.10148,astro-ph,"Buoyancy of the fossil magnetic field in the accretion disks of young stars is investigated. It is assumed that the Parker instability leads to the formation of slender flux tubes of toroidal magnetic field in the regions of effective magnetic field generation. Stationary solution of the induction equation is written in the form in which buoyancy is treated as the additional mechanism of the magnetic flux escape. We calculate the fossil magnetic field intensity in the accretion disks of young T Tauri stars for the cases when radius of the magnetic flux tubes equation, equation or equation, where equation is the accretion disk height scale.

1709.10475,astro-ph,"We present our study of OGLE-2014-SN-073, one of the brightest Type II SN ever discovered, with an unusually broad lightcurve combined with high ejecta velocities. From our hydrodynamical modelling we infer a remarkable ejecta mass of equation~Mequation, and a relatively high explosion energy of equation~erg. We show that this object belongs, with a very small number of other hydrogen-rich SNe, to an energy regime that is not explained by standard core-collapse (CC) neutrino-driven explosions. We compare the quantities inferred by the hydrodynamical modelling with the expectations of various exploding scenarios, trying to explain the high energy and luminosity released. We find some qualitative similarities with pair-instabilities SNe, although a prompt injection of energy by a magnetar seems also a viable alternative to explain such extreme event.",17,[],1
1709.03751,astro-ph,"The High Altitude Water Cherenkov observatory (HAWC) is an air shower array devised for TeV gamma-ray astronomy. HAWC is located at an altitude of 4100 m a.s.l. in Sierra Negra, Mexico. HAWC consists of 300 Water Cherenkov Detectors, each instrumented with 4 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). HAWC re-uses the Front-End Boards from the Milagro experiment to receive the PMT signals. These boards are used in combination with Time to Digital Converters (TDCs) to record the time and the amount of light in each PMT hit (light flash). A set of VME TDC modules (128 channels each) is operated in a continuous (dead time free) mode. The TDCs are read out via the VME bus by Single-Board Computers (SBCs), which in turn are connected to a gigabit Ethernet network. The complete system produces ~ 500 MB/s of raw data. A high-throughput data processing system has been designed and built to enable real-time data analysis. The system relies on off-the-shelf hardware components, an open-source software technology for data transfers (ZeroMQ) and a custom software framework for data analysis (AERIE). Multiple trigger and reconstruction algorithms can be combined and run on blocks of data in a parallel fashion, producing a set of output data streams which can be analyzed in real time with minimal latency (< 5 s).

1712.06364,astro-ph,"Modern extragalactic molecular gas surveys now reach the scales of star-forming giant molecular clouds (GMCs, 20-50 pc). Systematic variations in GMC properties with galaxy environment imply that clouds are not universally self-gravitating objects, decoupled from their surroundings. Here we reexamine the coupling of clouds to their environment and develop a model for 3D gas motions generated by forces arising with the galaxy gravitational potential defined by the background disk of stars and dark matter. We show that these motions can resemble or even exceed the motions needed to support gas against its own self-gravity throughout typical galaxy disks. The importance of the galactic potential in spiral arms and galaxy centers suggests that the response to self-gravity does not always dominate the motions of gas at GMC scales, with implications for observed gas kinematics, virial equilibrium and cloud morphology. We describe how a uniform treatment of gas motions in the plane and in the vertical direction synthesizes the two main mechanisms proposed to regulate star formation: vertical pressure equilibrium and shear/Coriolis forces as parameterized by Toomre Q~1. As the modeled motions are coherent and continually driven by the external potential, they represent support for the gas that is distinct from that conventionally attributed to turbulence, which decays rapidly and requires thus maintenance, e.g. via feedback from star formation. Thus our model suggests the galaxy itself can impose an important limit to star formation, as we explore in a second paper in this series.",17,[],1
1701.07982,astro-ph,"Most stars in the Galaxy are believed to be formed within star clusters from collapsing molecular clouds. However, the complete process of star formation, from the parent cloud to a gas-free star cluster, is still poorly understood. We perform radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of the collapse of a turbulent molecular cloud using the RAMSES-RT code. Stars are modelled using sink particles, from which we self-consistently follow the propagation of the ionising radiation. We study how different feedback models affect the gas expulsion from the cloud and how they shape the final properties of the emerging star cluster. We find that the star formation efficiency is lower for stronger feedback models. Feedback also changes the high mass end of the stellar mass function. Stronger feedback also allows the establishment of a lower density star cluster, which can maintain a virial or sub-virial state. In the absence of feedback, the star formation efficiency is very high, as well as the final stellar density. As a result, high energy close encounters make the cluster evaporate quickly. Other indicators, such as mass segregation, statistics of multiple systems and escaping stars confirm this picture. Observations of young star clusters are in best agreement with our strong feedback simulation.",17,[],1
1702.02587,astro-ph,"Using observations carried out with the GMRT, we performed high-quality full-synthesis imaging at 610 MHz of the source G29.370.1, which is an as-yet-unclassified object linked to the TeV source HESS J1844-030. These data, combined with observations at 1400 MHz from MAGPIS were used to investigate the properties of its radio emission. Additionally, we reprocessed XMM-Newton and Chandra archival data. G29.370.1 mainly consists of a bright twisted structure, named the S-shaped feature. The high sensitivity of the new GMRT observations allowed the identification of potential lobes, jets, and a nuclear central region in the S-shaped morphology of G29.370.1. We also highlight the detection of diffuse and low surface brightness emission enveloping the brightest emitting regions. The brightest emission in G29.370.1 has a radio synchrotron spectral index 0.59/-0.09. Variations in the spectral behavior are observed across the whole radio source with the flattest spectral features in the central nuclear and jets components (alpha~0.3). These results lead us to conclude that the brightest radio emission from G29.370.1 likely represents a newly recognized radio galaxy. The identification of optical and infrared counterparts to the emission from the core of G29.370.1 strengthens our interpretation of an extragalactic origin of the radio emission. Our spectral analysis demonstrated that a non-thermal origin for the X-ray emission compatible with a pulsar wind nebula is quite possible. The analysis of the spatial distribution of the CO gas revealed the presence of a complex of molecular clouds located in projection adjacent to the radio halo emission and probably interacting with it.

The most important of these is the role of magnetic fields in the star formation process on the scale of individual filaments and cores in dense regions. We describe the data acquisition and reduction processes for POL-2, demonstrating both repeatability and consistency with previous data. We present a first-look analysis of the first results from the BISTRO survey in the OMC 1 region.

Furthermore, we see an 'hour-glass' magnetic field morphology extending beyond the densest region of the integral filament into the less-dense surrounding material, and discuss possible causes for this. We also discuss the more complex morphology seen along the Orion Bar region. We examine the morphology of the field along the lower-density north-eastern filament.

We provide analytical estimates of the spectrum and of the polarization fraction of the synchrotron precursor for both relativistic and non-relativistic collisionless shock fronts, accounting for the self-generation or amplification of magnetic turbulence. In relativistic sources, the spectrum of the precursor is harder than that of the shocked plasma, because the upstream residence time increases with particle energy, leading to an effectively hard spectrum of accelerated particles in the precursor volume. At high frequencies, typically in the optical to X-ray range, the contribution of the precursor becomes sizeable, but we find that in most cases studied, it remains dominated by the synchrotron or inverse Compton contribution of the shocked plasma; its contribution might be detectable only in trans-relativistic shock waves. Non-relativistic sources offer the possibility of spectral imaging of the precursor by viewing the shock front edge-on. We calculate this spectro-morphological contribution for various parameters. The synchrotron contribution is also sizeable at the highest frequencies (X-ray range). If the turbulence is tangled in the plane transverse to the shock front, the resulting synchrotron radiation should be nearly maximally linearly polarized; polarimetry thus arises as an interesting tool to reveal this precursor.[Abridged]",17,[],1
1708.01441,astro-ph,"Weak gravitational lensing alters the apparent separations between observed sources, potentially affecting clustering statistics. We derive a general expression for the lensing deflection which is valid for any three-point statistic, and investigate its effect on the three-point clustering correlation function. We find that deflection of the clustering correlation function is greatest at around equation. It is most prominent in regions where the correlation function varies rapidly, in particular at the baryon acoustic oscillation scale where it smooths out the peaks and troughs, reducing the peak-to-trough difference by about 0.1 percent at equation and around 2.3 percent at equation. The modification due to lensing deflection is typically at the per cent level of the expected errors in a Euclid-like survey and therefore undetectable.",17,[],1
1708.00862,astro-ph,"Uranus and Neptune are ice giants with equation 15% atmospheres by mass, placing them in an intermediate category between rocky planets and gas giants. These atmospheres are too massive to have been primarily outgassed, yet they never underwent runaway gas accretion. The ice giants never reached critical core mass (equation) in a full gas disk, yet their cores are equation, suggesting that their envelopes were mainly accreted at the end of the disk lifetime. Pebble accretion calls into question traditional slow atmospheric growth during this phase. We show that the full-sized ice giants predominantly accreted gas from a disk depleted by at least a factor of equation. Such a disk dissipates in equation years. Why would both cores stay sub-critical for the entire equation Myr disk lifetime, only to reach equation in the final equation years? This is fine tuned. Ice giants in the outer disk have atmospheric mass fractions comparable to the disk gas-to-solid ratio during the bulk of their gas accretion. This point in disk evolution coincides with a dynamical upheaval: the gas loses its ability to efficiently damp the cores' random velocities, allowing them to be gravitationally excited by Jupiter and Saturn. We suggest that the ice giants' cores began growing on closer-in orbits (staying sub-critical), and migrated out during this dynamical instability. There, their orbits circularized after accreting much of their mass in solids. Finally, they accreted their envelopes from a depleted nebula, where the sparseness of feeding zone gas prevented runaway.",17,[],1
1706.01246,astro-ph,"Taipan is a multi-object spectroscopic galaxy survey starting in 2017 that will cover 2pi steradians over the southern sky, and obtain optical spectra for about two million galaxies out to z<0.4. Taipan will use the newly-refurbished 1.2m UK Schmidt Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory with the new TAIPAN instrument, which includes an innovative 'Starbugs' positioning system capable of rapidly and simultaneously deploying up to 150 spectroscopic fibres (and up to 300 with a proposed upgrade) over the 6-deg diameter focal plane, and a purpose-built spectrograph operating from 370 to 870nm with resolving power R>2000. The main scientific goals of Taipan are: (i) to measure the distance scale of the Universe (primarily governed by the local expansion rate, H0) to 1% precision, and the structure growth rate of structure to 5%; (ii) to make the most extensive map yet constructed of the mass distribution and motions in the local Universe, using peculiar velocities based on improved Fundamental Plane distances, which will enable sensitive tests of gravitational physics; and (iii) to deliver a legacy sample of low-redshift galaxies as a unique laboratory for studying galaxy evolution as a function of mass and environment. The final survey, which will be completed within 5 years, will consist of a complete magnitude-limited sample (i<17) of about 1.2x106 galaxies, supplemented by an extension to higher redshifts and fainter magnitudes (i<18.1) of a luminous red galaxy sample of about 0.8x106 galaxies. Observations and data processing will be carried out remotely and in a fully-automated way, using a purpose-built automated 'virtual observer' software and an automated data reduction pipeline. The Taipan survey is deliberately designed to maximise its legacy value, by complementing and enhancing current and planned surveys of the southern sky at wavelengths from the optical to the radio.",17,[],1
1701.07057,astro-ph,"We model the size distribution of supernova remnants to infer the surrounding ISM density. Using simple, yet standard SNR evolution models, we find that the distribution of ambient densities is remarkably narrow; either the standard assumptions about SNR evolution are wrong, or observable SNRs are biased to a narrow range of ambient densities. We show that the size distributions are consistent with log-normal, which severely limits the number of model parameters in any SNR population synthesis model. Simple Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the size distribution is indistinguishable from log-normal when the SNR sample size is less than 600. This implies that these SNR distributions provide only information on the mean and variance, yielding additional information only when the sample size grows larger than equation SNRs. To infer the parameters of the ambient density, we use Bayesian statistical inference under the assumption that SNR evolution is dominated by the Sedov phase. In particular, we use the SNR sizes and explosion energies to estimate the mean and variance of the ambient medium surrounding SNR progenitors. We find that the mean ISM particle density around our sample of SNRs is equation, in equation of particles per cubic centimeter, with variance equation. If interpreted at face value, this implies that most SNRs result from supernovae propagating in the warm, ionized medium. However, it is also likely that either SNR evolution is not dominated by the simple Sedov evolution or SNR samples are biased to the warm, ionized medium (WIM).",17,[],1
1709.04856,astro-ph,"We present the results of Very Large Array NHequation equation and equation observations of the HH 111/HH 121 protostellar system. HH 111, with a spectacular collimated optical jet, is one of the most well-known Herbig-Haro objects. We report the detection of a new source (NHequationS) in the vicinity of HH 111/HH 121 (equation0.03 pc from the HH 111 jet source) in two epochs of the ammonia observations. This constitutes the first detection of this source, in a region which has been thoroughly covered previously by both continuum and spectral line interferometric observations. We study the kinematic and physical properties of HH 111 and the newly discovered NHequationS. We also use HCOequation and HCN equation data obtained with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope and archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array equationCO, equationCO, and CequationO equation, NequationDequation equation, and equationCS equation data to gain insight into the nature of NHequationS. The chemical structure of NHequationS shows evidence for ""selective freeze-out"", an inherent characteristic of dense cold cores. The inner part of NHequationS shows subsonic non-thermal velocity dispersions indicating a ""coherent core"", while they increase in the direction of the jets. Archival near- to far-infrared data show no indication of any embedded source in NHequationS. The properties of NHequationS and its location in the infrared dark cloud suggest that it is a starless core located in a turbulent medium with turbulence induced by Herbig-Haro jets and associated outflows. More data is needed to fully understand the physical and chemical properties of NHequationS and if/how its evolution is affected by nearby jets.",17,[],1

BASS is an imaging survey of about 5400 degequation in equation and equation bands using the 2.3 m Bok telescope.

BASS and MzLS have respectively completed about 72% and 76% of their observations. The two surveys will be served for the spectroscopic targeting of the upcoming Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. Both BASS and MzLS data are reduced by the same pipeline. We have updated the basic data reduction and photometric methods in DR2. In particular, source detections are performed on stacked images, and photometric measurements are co-added from single-epoch images based on these sources. The median 5equation depths with corrections of the Galactic extinction are 24.05, 23.61, and 23.10 mag for equation, equation, and equation bands, respectively.

1703.05764,astro-ph,"We present ALMA detections of the [CI] 1-0, CO J=3-2, and CO J=4-3 emission lines, as well as the ALMA band 4 continuum for a compact star-forming galaxy (cSFG) at z=2.225, 3D-HST GS30274. As is typical for cSFGs, this galaxy has a stellar mass of equation, with a star formation rate of equation putting it on the star-forming `main-sequence', but with an H-band effective radius of 2.5 kpc, making it much smaller than the bulk of `main-sequence' star-forming galaxies. The intensity ratio of the line detections yield an ISM density (~ 6 equation) and a UV-radiation field ( ~2 equation), similar to the values in local starburst and ultra-luminous infrared galaxy environments. A starburst phase is consistent with the short depletion times (equation Myr) we find using three different proxies for the H2 mass ([CI], CO, dust mass). This depletion time is significantly shorter than in more extended SFGs with similar stellar masses and SFRs. Moreover, the gas fraction of 3D-HST GS30274 is smaller than typically found in extended galaxies. We measure the CO and [CI] kinematics and find a FWHM line width of ~equation km sequation. The CO and [CI] FWHM are consistent with a previously measured Hequation FWHM for this source. The line widths are consistent with gravitational motions, suggesting we are seeing a compact molecular gas reservoir. A previous merger event, as suggested by the asymmetric light profile, may be responsible for the compact distribution of gas and has triggered a central starburst event. This event gives rise to the starburst-like ISM properties and short depletion times. The centrally located and efficient star formation is quickly building up a dense core of stars, responsible for the compact distribution of stellar light in 3D-HST GS30274.",17,[],1
1706.05652,astro-ph,"We analyzed the NANTEN2 13CO (J=2-1 and 1-0) datasets in NGC 2024. We found that the cloud consists of two velocity components, whereas the cloud shows mostly single-peaked CO profiles. The two components are physically connected to the HII region as evidenced by their close correlation with the dark lanes and the emission nebulosity. The two components show complementary distribution with a displacement of 0.4 pc. Such complementary distribution is typical to colliding clouds discovered in regions of high-mass star formation. We hypothesize that cloud-cloud collision between the two components triggered the formation of the late O stars and early B stars localized within 0.3 pc of the cloud peak. The collision timescale is estimated to be ~ 105 yrs from a ratio of the displacement and the relative velocity 3-4 km s-1 corrected for probable projection. The high column density of the colliding cloud 1023 cm-2 is similar to those in the other massive star clusters in RCW 38, Westerlund 2, NGC 3603, and M42, which are likely formed under trigger by cloud-cloud collision. The present results provide an additional piece of evidence favorable to high-mass star formation by a major cloud-cloud collision in Orion.",17,[],1
1701.04116,astro-ph,"We observed the field of the Fermi source 3FGL J0838.8-2829 in optical and X-rays, initially motivated by the cataclysmic variable (CV) 1RXS J083842.1-282723 that lies within its error circle. Several X-ray sources first classified as CVs have turned out to be gamma-ray emitting millisecond pulsars (MSPs). We find that 1RXS J083842.1-282723 is in fact an unusual CV, a stream-fed asynchronous polar in which accretion switches between magnetic poles (that are equation120equation apart) when the accretion rate is at minimum. High-amplitude X-ray modulation at periods of 94.8equation0.4 minutes and 14.7equation1.2 hr are seen. The former appears to be the spin period, while latter is inferred to be one-third of the beat period between the spin and the orbit, implying an orbital period of 98.3equation0.5 minutes. We also measure an optical emission-line spectroscopic period of 98.413equation0.004 minutes which is consistent with the orbital period inferred from the X-rays. In any case, this system is unlikely to be the gamma-ray source. Instead, we find a fainter variable X-ray and optical source, XMMU J083850.38-282756.8, that is modulated on a time scale of hours in addition to exhibiting occasional sharp flares. It resembles the black widow or redback pulsars that have been discovered as counterparts of Fermi sources, with the optical modulation due to heating of the photosphere of a low-mass companion star by, in this case, an as-yet undetected MSP. We propose XMMU J083850.38-282756.8 as the MSP counterpart of 3FGL J0838.8-2829.",17,[],1
1702.04643,astro-ph,"We present the results of a study of different statistical methods currently used in the literature to analyse the (micro)variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from ground-based optical observations. In particular, we focus on the comparison between the results obtained by applying the so-called C and F statistics, which are based on the ratio of standard deviations and variances, respectively. The motivation for this is that the implementation of these methods leads to different and contradictory results, making the variability classification of the light curves of a certain source dependent on the statistics implemented.   For this purpose, we re-analyse the results on an AGN sample observed along several sessions with the 2.15m ""Jorge Sahade"" telescope (CASLEO), San Juan, Argentina. For each AGN we constructed the nightly differential light curves. We thus obtained a total of 78 light curves for 39 AGNs, and we then applied the statistical tests mentioned above, in order to re-classify the variability state of these light curves and in an attempt to find the suitable statistical methodology to study photometric (micro)variations. We conclude that, although the equation criterion is not proper a statistical test, it could still be a suitable parameter to detect variability and that its application allows us to get more reliable variability results, in contrast with the F test.",17,[],1
1703.08884,astro-ph,"We investigate the activity induced signals related to rotation in late type stars (FGKM). We analyse the Ca II H&K, the H alpha and the radial velocity time-series of 55 stars using the spectra from the HARPS public database and the light-curves provided by the ASAS survey. We search for short term periodic signals in the time-series of activity indicators as well as in the photometric light-curves. Radial velocity data sets are then analysed to determine the presence of activity induced signals. We measure a radial velocity signal induced by rotational modulation of stellar surface features in 37 stars, from late F-type to mid M-type stars. We report an empirical relationship, with some degree of spectral type dependency, between the mean level of chromospheric emission measured by the log(Rhk) and the measured radial velocity semi amplitude. We also report a relationship betweeen the semi amplitude of the chromospheric measured signal and the semi amplitude of the radial velocity induced signal, which strongly depends on the spectral type. We find that for a given strength of chromospheric activity (i.e. a given rotation period) M-type stars tend to induce larger rotation related radial velocity signals than G and K-type stars.",17,[],1
1703.05358,astro-ph,"We report the discovery of periodic modulation of pulsation in 51 fundamental mode classical Cepheids of the Magellanic Clouds observed by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. Although the overall incidence rate is very low, about 1 per cent in each of the Magellanic Clouds, in the case of the SMC and pulsation periods between 12 and 16d the incidence rate is nearly 40 per cent. On the other hand, in the LMC the highest incidence rate is 5 per cent for pulsation periods between 8 and 14d, and the overall amplitude of the effect is smaller. It indicates that the phenomenon is metallicity dependent. Typical modulation periods are between 70 and 300d. In nearly all stars the mean brightness is modulated, which, in principle, may influence the use of classical Cepheids for distance determination. Fortunately, the modulation of mean brightness does not exceed 0.01 mag in all but one star. Also, the effect averages out in typical observations spanning a long time base. Consequently, the effect of modulation on the determination of the distance moduli is negligible. The relative modulation amplitude of the fundamental mode is also low and, with one exception, it does not exceed 6 per cent. The origin of the modulation is unknown. We draw a hypothesis that the modulation is caused by the 2:1 resonance between the fundamental mode and the second overtone that shapes the famous Hertzsprung bump progression.",17,[],1
1704.04776,astro-ph,"Water and hydroxyl, once thought to be found only in the primitive airless bodies that formed beyond roughly 2.5-3 AU, have recently been detected on the Moon and Vesta, which both have surfaces dominated by evolved, non-primitive compositions. In both these cases, the water/OH is thought to be exogenic, either brought in via impacts with comets or hydrated asteroids or created via solar wind interactions with silicates in the regolith or both. Such exogenic processes should also be occurring on other airless body surfaces. To test this hypothesis, we used the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) to measure reflectance spectra (2.0 to 4.1 letterm) of two large near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) with compositions generally interpreted as anhydrous: 433 Eros and 1036 Ganymed. OH is detected on both of these bodies in the form of absorption features near 3 letterm. The spectra contain a component of thermal emission at longer wavelengths, from which we estimate thermal of 167/- 98 J m-2s-1/2K-1 for Eros (consistent with previous estimates) and 214/- 80 J m-2s-1/2K-1 for Ganymed, the first reported measurement of thermal inertia for this object.

1704.05502,astro-ph,"We present the first identification of a candidate precursor for an imminent red nova. Our prediction is based on the example of the precursor to the red nova V1309 Sco, which was retrospectively found to be a contact binary with an exponentially decreasing period. We explore the use of this distinctive timing signature to identify precursors, developing the observational and analysis steps needed. We estimate that our Galaxy has roughly 1-10 observable precursors. Specifically, we lay out the observational case for KIC 9832227, which we identified as a tentative candidate two years ago (Molnar et al. 2015, AAS Meeting Abstracts 415.05). Orbital timing over the past two years has followed the tentative exponential fit. As of late 2015, the period time derivative went beyond the range found in other systems (dP/dt < 1x10-8), a necessary criterion for a serious candidate. We estimate time of merger is the year 2022.2(7). Double absorption line spectra confirm directly the 0.458 d light curve period is a contact binary system and yield a mass ratio mB/mA = 0.228(3). Closer analysis of the Kepler timing data shows evidence of a component C with orbital period PC = 590(8) days and mC x sin iC = 0.11 solar masses. An alternative interpretation of the long term timing trend, light travel time delay due to orbit around a distant component D, is ruled out by the spectroscopic data for any nondegenerate star. Additional measurements are needed to test further the merging hypothesis and to utilize fully this fortuitous opportunity.",17,[],1
1701.00890,astro-ph,"We present new SINFONI near-infrared integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy and SALT optical long-slit spectroscopy characterising the history of a nearby merging luminous infrared galaxy, dubbed the Bird (IRAS19115-2114). The NIR line-ratio maps of the IFU data-cubes and stellar population fitting of the SALT spectra now allow dating of the star formation (SF) over the triple system uncovered from our previous adaptive optics data. The distinct components separate very clearly in a line-ratio diagnostic diagram. An off-nuclear pure starburst dominates the current SF of the Bird with 60-70% of the total, with a 4-7 Myr age, and signs of a fairly constant long-term star formation of the underlying stellar population. The most massive nucleus, in contrast, is quenched with a starburst age of >40 Myr and shows hints of budding AGN activity. The secondary massive nucleus is at an intermediate stage. The two major components have a population of older stars, consistent with a starburst triggered 1 Gyr ago in a first encounter. The simplest explanation of the history is that of a triple merger, where the strongly star forming component has joined later. We detect multiple gas flows in different phases. The Bird offers an opportunity to witness multiple stages of galaxy evolution in the same system; triggering as well as quenching of SF, and the early appearance of AGN activity. It also serves as a cautionary note on interpretations of observations with lower spatial resolution and/or without infrared data. At high-redshift the system would look like a clumpy starburst with crucial pieces of its puzzle hidden, in danger of misinterpretations.",17,[],1

Our measurement of vLSR = 53 /- 1 km s-1 does not definitively resolve the nature of the source, but supports the general conclusion that the source is in the bulge.

We examine the energy and momentum transfer from the Poynting flux to the gas by solving time-dependent hydrodynamical simulations with explicitly taking into account low-frequency \Alfvenic waves of period of 0.5 Myr in a one-dimensional vertical magnetic flux tube. The \Alfvenic waves propagate upward into the Galactic halo, and they are damped through the propagation along meandering magnetic field lines. If the turbulence is nearly trans-Alfv\'enic, the wave damping is significant, which leads to the formation of an upward propagating shock wave.

The simulations are initialised with disruption trajectories from 3-body integrations of stars with parabolic orbits with respect to the binary center of mass. The most common outcome is found to be the formation of an unbound debris stream, with either weak late-time accretion or no accretion at all. A substantial fraction of streams remain bound, however, and these commonly yield structured fallback rate curves that exhibit multiple peaks or sharp drops.

Profiles of multiple emission lines are modeled by a sum of several Gaussian functions. The spectral analysis allows us to identify 1) a prevalence of both [OIII]equation line blue asymmetry and bulk velocity blueshift of both [NeIII]equation and [NeV]equation lines, when the [\ionO2]equation line is used as a reference. The velocity offset of [\ionO3]equation line is, however, distributed around zero value, except for a few outliers. 2) not only the significant [OIII]equation line asymmetry, but also the large bulk velocity offsets of [NeIII]equation and [NeV]equation emission lines tend to occur in the objects with high equation, which is considerably consistent with the conclusions based on local AGNs. With three equation estimation methods, the significance level of the trend is found to be better than equation, equation and equation for [OIII], [NeIII] and [NeV], respectively. \rm After excluding the role of radio jets, the revealed dependence of NLR gas outflow on equation allows us to argue that the pressure caused by the wind/radiation launched/emitted from central supermassive black hole is the most likely origin of the outflow in these distant quasars, which implies that the outflow in luminous AGNs up to equation have the same origin.",17,[],1

The soft lag, which is the time delay between the hard and soft X-ray light curves, is usually interpreted as the time difference between the direct and reflected emission, but is alternatively suggested to arise from the direct and scattering emission from distant clouds. By analysing the archival Suzaku observations totalling an exposure time of ~ 770 ks, we discover a soft lag of equation ks at equation Hz in the luminous quasar PDS 456, which is the longest soft lag and lowest Fourier frequency reported to date. In this study, we use the maximum likelihood method to deal with non-continuous nature of the Suzaku light curves. The result follows the mass-scaling relation for soft lags, which further supports that soft lags originate from the innermost areas of AGN and hence are best interpreted by the reflection scenario. Spectral analysis has been performed in this work and we find no evidence of clumpy partial-covering absorbers. The spectrum can be explained by a self-consistent relativistic reflection model with warm absorbers, and spectral variations over epochs can be accounted for by the change of the continuum, and of column density and ionization states of the warm absorbers.",17,[],1

Because of the effects of possible residual fractionation, the derived value of the metallicity equation actually represents a lower limit to the true metallicity of the Sun. However, when compared with helioseismological measurements, solar models computed using these new abundances fail to restore agreement, owing to the implausibly high abundance of refractory (Mg, Si, S, Fe) elements, which correlates with a higher core temperature and hence an overproduction of solar neutrinos.

However, the distance modulus of the cluster is estimated to be 11.9/-0.2 mag (d = 2.4/-0.2 kpc) from the reddening-free color-magnitude diagrams, which is larger than the distance to the nearby massive star-forming region W3(OH) measured from the radio VLBA astrometry. We also determined the age of IC 1805 (tauMSTO = 3.5 Myr). In addition, we critically compared the age and mass scale from two pre-main-sequence evolution models. The initial mass function with a Salpeter-type slope of Gamma = -1.3/-0.2 was obtained and the total mass of IC 1805 was estimated to be about 2700/-200 Msun.

We derive the uncertainties on the stellar population synthesis properties using a Monte Carlo simulation and examine the correlations between the parameters with and without the use of the spectrum in the modeling of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The spectroscopic constraints confirm the extreme stellar masses of the galaxies in our sample. We find that three out of five galaxies are quiescent (star formation rate of equation) with low levels of dust obscuration (equation) , that one galaxy displays both high levels of star formation and dust obscuration (equation, equation~mag), and that the remaining galaxy has properties that are intermediate between the quiescent and star-forming populations.",17,[],1

Probing their origin will be difficult due to the expected lack of electromagnetic emission and limited localization accuracy. Associations with rare host galaxy types -- such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) -- can nevertheless be identified statistically through spatial correlation. We show that (i) fractional contributions equation from AGN hosts to the total BBH merger rate can be statistically established with 70-300 detected events (expected in 0.5-2 years of observation with Advanced LIGO-Virgo at design sensitivity and current rate estimates); (ii) fractional contributions as low as equation can be tested with 1000 events (equation 5\,years of observation); (iii) the equation best localized GWs drive these constraints.

1708.03217,astro-ph,"We use optical spectra from the inner 1.8 equation 2.5kpcequation of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC1358, obtained with the GMOS integral field spectrograph on the Gemini South telescope at a spatial resolution of equation 165pc, to assess the feeding and feedback processes in this nearby active galaxy. Five gaseous kinematical components are observed in the emission line profiles. One of the components is present in the entire field-of-view and we interpret it as due to gas rotating in the disk of the galaxy. Three of the remaining components we interpret as associated to active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback: a compact unresolved outflow in the inner 1 arcsec and two gas clouds observed at opposite sides of the nucleus, which we propose have been ejected in a previous AGN burst. The disk component velocity field is strongly disturbed by a large scale bar. The subtraction of a velocity model combining both rotation and bar flows reveals three kinematic nuclear spiral arms: two in inflow and one in outflow.

1710.08899,astro-ph,"Bayesian parameter inference depends on a choice of prior probability distribution for the parameters in question. The prior which makes the posterior distribution maximally sensitive to data is called the Jeffreys prior, and it is completely determined by the response of the likelihood to changes in parameters. Under the assumption that the likelihood is a Gaussian distribution, the Jeffreys prior is a constant, i.e. flat. However, if one parameter is constrained by physical considerations, the Gaussian approximation fails and the flat prior is no longer the Jeffreys prior.   In this paper we compute the correct Jeffreys prior for a multivariate normal distribution constrained in one dimension, and we apply it to the sum of neutrino masses equation and the tensor-to-scalar ratio equation. We find that one-dimensional marginalised posteriors for these two parameters change considerably and that the 68% and 95% Bayesian upper limits increase by 9% and 4% respectively for equation and 22% and 3% for equation. Adding the prior to an existing chain can be done as a trivial importance sampling in the final step of the analysis proces.",17,[],1
1706.04771,astro-ph,"I examine a possible spectral distortion of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) due to its absorption by galactic and intergalactic dust. I show that even subtle intergalactic opacity of equation at the CMB wavelengths in the local Universe causes non-negligible CMB absorption and decline of the CMB intensity because the opacity steeply increases with redshift. The CMB should be distorted even during the epoch of the Universe defined by redshifts equation. For this epoch, the maximum spectral distortion of the CMB is at least equation at 300 GHz being well above the sensitivity of the COBE/FIRAS, WMAP or Planck flux measurements. If dust mass is considered to be redshift dependent with noticeable dust abundance at redshifts 2-4, the predicted CMB distortion is even higher. The CMB would be distorted also in a perfectly transparent universe due to dust in galaxies but this effect is lower by one order than that due to intergalactic opacity. The fact that the distortion of the CMB by dust is not observed is intriguing and questions either opacity and extinction law measurements or validity of the current model of the Universe.",17,[],1

Here it is demonstrated that the normally considered dissipative gravitational tidal evolution of rocky planet rotation could, in principle, be 'stalled' by thermal tide resonances for Earth-analog worlds in the liquid water orbital zone of stars more massive than ~0.3 Msolar. The possibility of feedback effects between a planetary biosphere and the planetary rotational evolution are examined. Building on earlier studies, it is suggested that atmospheric oxygenation, and ozone production could play a key role in planetary rotation evolution, and therefore represents a surprising but potent form of biological imprint on astronomically accessible planetary characteristics.",17,[],1
1708.08459,astro-ph,"We present the results of our work to determine the average albedo for small, close-in planets in the \it Kepler candidate catalog. We have adapted our method of averaging short cadence light curves of multiple Kepler planet candidates to long cadence data, in order to detect an average albedo for the group of candidates. Long cadence data exist for many more candidates than the short cadence, and so we separate the candidates into smaller radius bins than in our previous work: 1-2 Rearth, 2-4 Rearth, and 4-6 Rearth. We find that on average, all three groups appear darker than suggested by the short cadence result, but not as dark as many hot Jupiters. The average geometric albedos for the three groups are 0.11 equation 0.06, 0.05 equation 0.04, and 0.11 equation 0.08, respectively, for the case where heat is uniformly distributed about the planet. If heat redistribution is inefficient, the albedos are even lower, since there will be a greater thermal contribution to the total light from the planet. We confirm that newly-identified false positive Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) 1662.01 is indeed an eclipsing binary at twice the period listed in the planet candidate catalog. We also newly identify planet candidate KOI 4351.01 as an eclipsing binary, and we report a secondary eclipse measurement for Kepler-4b (KOI 7.01) of equation 7.50 ppm at a phase of equation 0.7, indicating that the planet is on an eccentric orbit.",17,[],1

COCOA is able to present the output of realistic numerical simulations of star clusters carried out using Monte Carlo or \textitN-body codes in a way that is useful for direct comparison with photometric observations. In this paper, we describe the COCOA code and demonstrate its different applications by utilizing globular cluster (GC) models simulated with the MOCCA (MOnte Carlo Cluster simulAtor) code. COCOA is used to synthetically observe these different GC models with optical telescopes, perform PSF photometry and subsequently produce observed colour magnitude diagrams. We also use COCOA to compare the results from synthetic observations of a cluster model that has the same age and metallicity as the Galactic GC NGC 2808 with observations of the same cluster carried out with a 2.2 meter optical telescope. We find that COCOA can effectively simulate realistic observations and recover photometric data.

1706.00601,astro-ph,"Afterglows of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are simple in the most basic model, but can show many complex features. The ultra-long duration GRB 111209A, one of the longest GRBs ever detected, also has the best-monitored afterglow in this rare class of GRBs. We want to address the question whether GRB 111209A was a special event beyond its extreme duration alone, and whether it is a classical GRB or another kind of high-energy transient. The afterglow may yield significant clues. We present afterglow photometry obtained in seven bands with the GROND imager as well as in further seven bands with the UVOT telescope on-board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. The light curve is analysed by multi-band modelling and joint fitting with power-laws and broken power-laws, and we use the contemporaneous GROND data to study the evolution of the spectral energy distribution. We compare the optical afterglow to a large ensemble we have analysed in earlier works, and especially to that of another ultra-long event, GRB 130925A. We furthermore undertake a photometric study of the host galaxy. We find a strong, chromatic rebrightening event at approx 0.8 days after the GRB, during which the spectral slope becomes redder. After this, the light curve decays achromatically, with evidence for a break at about 9 days after the trigger. The afterglow luminosity is found to not be exceptional. We find that a double-jet model is able to explain the chromatic rebrightening. The afterglow features have been detected in other events and are not unique. The duration aside, the GRB prompt emission and afterglow parameters of GRB 111209A are in agreement with the known distributions for these parameters. While the central engine of this event may differ from that of classical GRBs, there are multiple lines of evidence pointing to GRB 111209A resulting from the core-collapse of a massive star with a stripped envelope.",17,[],1

We divide our primary sample in two subsamples according to whether the sources lay (679 sources) or not (881 sources) inside the sky region defined by the Planck Galactic mask (fsky ~ 60 per cent) and the area around the Magellanic Clouds. We find that the average fractional polarisation of compact sources is approximately constant (with frequency) in both samples (with a weighted mean over all the channels of 3.08 per cent outside and 3.54 per cent inside the Planck mask). In the sky region outside the adopted mask, we also estimate the letter and letter parameters for the log-normal distribution of the fractional polarisation, finding a weighted mean value over all the Planck frequency range of 1.0 for letter and 0.7 for letter (that would imply a weighted mean value for the median fractional polarisation of 1.9 per cent).",17,[],1
1702.06578,astro-ph,"Models of debris disk morphology are often focused on the effects of a planet orbiting interior to or within the disk. Nonetheless, an exterior planetary-mass perturber can also excite eccentricities in a debris disk, via Laplace-Lagrange secular perturbations in the coplanar case or Kozai-Lidov perturbations for mutually inclined companions and disks. HD 106906 is an ideal example of such a system, as it harbors a confirmed exterior 11 MJup companion at a projected separation of 650 au outside a resolved, asymmetric disk. We use collisional and dynamical simulations to investigate the interactions between the disk and the companion, and to use the disk's observed morphology to place constraints on the companion's orbit. We conclude that the disk's observed morphology is consistent with perturbations from the observed exterior companion. Generalizing this result, we suggest that exterior perturbers, as well as interior planets, should be considered when investigating the cause of observed asymmetries in a debris disk.",17,[],1

1712.02425,astro-ph,"The paper deals with a computational method for detection of the solar system minor bodies (SSOs), whose inter-frame shifts in series of CCD-frames during the observation are commensurate with the errors in measuring their positions. These objects have velocities of apparent motion between CCD-frames not exceeding three RMS errors (equation) of measurements of their positions. About 15\% of objects have a near-zero apparent motion in CCD-frames, including the objects beyond the Jupiter's orbit as well as the asteroids heading straight to the Earth.   The proposed method for detection of the object's near-zero apparent motion in series of CCD-frames is based on the Fisher f-criterion instead of using the traditional decision rules that are based on the maximum likelihood criterion. We analyzed the quality indicators of detection of the object's near-zero apparent motion applying statistical and in situ modeling techniques in terms of the conditional probability of the true detection of objects with a near-zero apparent motion.   The efficiency of method being implemented as a plugin for the Collection Light Technology (CoLiTec) software for automated asteroids and comets detection has been demonstrated. Among the objects discovered with this plugin, there was the sungrazing comet C/2012 S1 (ISON). Within 26 minutes of the observation, the comet's image has been moved by three pixels in a series of four CCD-frames (the velocity of its apparent motion at the moment of discovery was equal to 0.8 pixels per CCD-frame; the image size on the frame was about five pixels). Next verification in observations of asteroids with a near-zero apparent motion conducted with small telescopes has confirmed an efficiency of the method even in bad conditions (strong backlight from the full Moon).

1702.06500,astro-ph,"Recent spectropolarimetric surveys of bright, hot stars have found that ~10% of OB-type stars contain strong (mostly dipolar) surface magnetic fields (~kG). The prominent paradigm describing the interaction between the stellar winds and the surface magnetic field is the magnetically confined wind shock (MCWS) model. In this model, the stellar wind plasma is forced to move along the closed field loops of the magnetic field, colliding at the magnetic equator, and creating a shock. As the shocked material cools radiatively it will emit X-rays. Therefore, X-ray spectroscopy is a key tool in detecting and characterizing the hot wind material confined by the magnetic fields of these stars. Some B-type stars are found to have very short rotational periods. The effects of the rapid rotation on the X-ray production within the magnetosphere have yet to be explored in detail. The added centrifugal force due to rapid rotation is predicted to cause faster wind outflows along the field lines, leading to higher shock temperatures and harder X-rays. However, this is not observed in all rapidly rotating magnetic B-type stars. In order to address this from a theoretical point of view, we use the X-ray Analytical Dynamical Magnetosphere (XADM) model, originally developed for slow rotators, with an implementation of new rapid rotational physics. Using X-ray spectroscopy from ESA's XMM-Newton space telescope, we observed 5 rapidly rotating B-type stars to add to the previous list of observations. Comparing the observed X-ray luminosity and hardness ratio to that predicted by the XADM allows us to determine the role the added centrifugal force plays in the magnetospheric X-ray emission of these stars.",17,[],1

We report results from radio images with half to one arc-second angular resolution at three frequencies, plus HST and Spitzer data. The Chandra data allow us to measure the X-ray spectral index in 10 distinct regions along the 18 arcsec jet and compare with the radio index. The radio and X-ray spectral indices of the jet regions are consistent with a value of equation throughout the jet, to within 2 sigma uncertainties. The X-ray jet structure to the south extends beyond the prominent radio jet and connects to the southern radio lobe, and there is extended X-ray emission in the direction of the unseen counter jet and coincident with the northern radio lobe. This jet is remarkable since its straight appearance over a large distance allows the geometry factors to be taken as fixed along the jet. Using the model of inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background (iC/CMB) by relativistic electrons, we find that the magnetic field strengths and Doppler factors are relatively constant along the jet. If instead the X-rays are synchrotron emission, they must arise from a population of electrons distinct from the particles producing the radio synchrotron spectrum.",17,[],1
1709.04168,astro-ph,"Cross-correlation between the redshifted 21 cm signal and Lyman-\alpha emitters (LAEs) is powerful tool to probe the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Although the cross-power spectrum (PS) has an advantage of not correlating with foregrounds much brighter than the 21 cm signal, the galactic and extra-galactic foregrounds prevent detection since they contribute to the variance of the cross PS. Therefore, strategies for mitigating foregrounds are required. In this work, we study the impact of foreground avoidance on the measurement of the 21 cm-LAE cross-correlation. We then simulate the 21 cm observation as observed by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The point source foreground is modelled from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey catalogue, and the diffuse foreground is evaluated using a parametric model. For LAE observations, we assume a large survey of the Subaru Hyper Supreme-Cam (HSC), with spectroscopic observations of the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS). To predict the 21 cm signal, we employ a numerical simulation combining post processed radiative transfer and radiation hydrodynamics. Using these models, the signal-to-noise ratio of 2D PS shows the foreground contamination dominates the error of cross-PS even in the so-called `EoR window'. We find that at least 99% of the point source foreground and 80% of the galactic diffuse foreground must be removed to measure the EoR signal at large scales equation. Additionally, a sensitivity 80 times larger than that of the MWA operating with 128 tiles and 99% of the point source foreground removal are required for a detection at small scales.",17,[],1

For the first time we extend stacking to include the effects of confusion. We develop our algorithm in a fully Bayesian framework and apply it to the Square Kilometre Array Design Study (SKADS) simulation in order to extract galaxy number counts. Previous studies have shown that recovered source counts are highly biased high when confusion is non-negligible. With this new method, source counts are returned correctly.

1710.09590,astro-ph,"NGC 4993, as a host galaxy of the electromagnetic counterpart of the first gravitational-wave detection of a binary neutron-star merger, was observed by many powerful telescopes from radio to equation-ray waveband. The weak nuclear activities of NGC 4993 suggest that it is a low-luminosity active galactic nuclear (LLAGN). We build the multi-waveband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of NGC 4993 from literatures. We find that the radio spectrum at equation GHz is much steeper than that of low-frequency waveband (e.g., 6-100 GHz), where this break was also found in the supermassive black holes in our galaxy center (Sgr A*), and in some other nearby AGNs. The radio emission above and below this break may has different physical origins, which provide an opportunity to probe the accretion and jet properties. We model the multi-waveband SEDs of NGC 4993 with an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF)-jet model. We find that the high-frequency steep radio emission at millimeter waveband is consistent with the prediction of the ADAF, while the low-frequency flat radio spectrum is better fitted by the jet. Further more, the X-ray emission can be also explained by the ADAF model simultaneously. From the model fits, we estimate important parameters of the central engine (e.g., accretion rate near the horizon of the black hole and mass-loss rate in jet) for NGC 4993. This result strengthen that the millimiter, submillimer and deep X-ray observations are crucial to understand the weak or quiescent activities in supermassive black-hole systems. Further simultaneous millimeter and X-ray monitoring of this kind of LLAGNs will help us to better understand the physical origin of multiwaveband emission.",17,[],1

The line profiles of CRSFs cannot be described by an analytic expression. Numerical methods such as Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the scattering processes are required in order to predict precise line shapes for a given physical setup, which can be compared to observations to gain information about the underlying physics in these systems.   A versatile simulation code is needed for the generation of synthetic cyclotron lines. Sophisticated geometries should be investigatable by making their simulation possible for the first time.   The simulation utilizes the mean free path tables described in the first paper of this series for the fast interpolation of propagation lengths. The code is parallelized to make the very time consuming simulations possible on convenient time scales. Furthermore, it can generate responses to mono-energetic photon injections, producing Green's functions, which can be used later to generate spectra for arbitrary continua.   We develop a new simulation code to generate synthetic cyclotron lines for complex scenarios, allowing for unprecedented physical interpretation of the observed data. An associated XSPEC model implementation is used to fit synthetic line profiles to NuSTAR data of Cep X-4.

1701.03538,astro-ph,"We investigate how the hydrostatic suppression of baryonic accretion affects the growth rate of dark matter halos during the Epoch of Reionization. By comparing halo properties in a simplistic hydrodynamic simulation in which gas only cools adiabatically, with its collisionless equivalent, we find that halo growth is slowed as hydrostatic forces prevent gas from collapsing. In our simulations, at the high redshifts relevant for reionization (between equation and equation), halos that host dwarf galaxies (equation) can be reduced by up to a factor of 2 in mass due to the hydrostatic pressure of baryons. Consequently, the inclusion of baryonic effects reduces the amplitude of the low mass tail of the halo mass function by factors of 2 to 4. In addition, we find that the fraction of baryons in dark matter halos hosting dwarf galaxies at high redshift never exceeds equation of the cosmic baryon fraction. When implementing baryonic processes, including cooling, star formation, supernova feedback and reionization, the suppression effects become more significant with further reductions of equation to 60\%. Although convergence tests suggest that the suppression may become weaker in higher resolution simulations, this suppressed growth will be important for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation, in which the halo mass inherited from an underlying N-body simulation directly determines galaxy properties. Based on the adiabatic simulation, we provide tables to account for these effects in N-body simulations, and present a modification of the halo mass function along with explanatory analytic calculations.",17,[],1

We demonstrate that we can efficiently generate deterministic and random displacements for many particles using preconditioned Krylov iterative methods, if kernel methods to efficiently compute the action of the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) mobility matrix and it ""square"" root are available for the given boundary conditions. We address a major challenge in large-scale BD simulations, capturing the stochastic drift term that arises because of the configuration-dependent mobility. Unlike the widely-used Fixman midpoint scheme, our methods utilize random finite differences and do not require the solution of resistance problems or the computation of the action of the inverse square root of the RPY mobility matrix. We construct two temporal schemes which are viable for large scale simulations, an Euler-Maruyama traction scheme and a Trapezoidal Slip scheme, which minimize the number of mobility solves per time step while capturing the required stochastic drift terms. We validate and compare these schemes numerically by modeling suspensions of boomerang shaped particles sedimented near a bottom wall. Using the trapezoidal scheme, we investigate the steady-state active motion in a dense suspensions of confined microrollers, whose height above the wall is set by a combination of thermal noise and active flows.

1710.02707,cond-mat,"Conventional Josephson metal-insulator-metal devices are inherently underdamped and exhibit hysteretic current-voltage response due to a very high subgap resistance compared to that in the normal state. At the same time, overdamped junctions with single-valued characteristics are needed for most superconducting digital applications. The usual way to overcome the hysteretic behavior is to place an external low-resistance normal-metal shunt in parallel with each junction. Unfortunately, such solution results in a considerable complication of the circuitry design and introduces parasitic inductance through the junction. This paper provides a concise overview of some generic approaches that have been proposed in order to realize internal shunting in Josephson heterostructures with a barrier that itself contains the desired resistive component. The main attention is paid to self-shunted devices with local weak-link transmission probabilities so strongly disordered in the interface plane that transmission probabilities are tiny for the main part of the transition region between two superconducting electrodes, while a small part of the interface is well transparent.

In various limits we provide perturbative results consistent with our numerical calculations. We find that the equation-equation mixing can be large, with up to 20\% occupation of orbitals that are nominally ""empty"", which has experimental implications for the interpretation of the branching ratio in experiments, and can impact the effective local moment Hamiltonian used to study magnetic phases and magnetic excitations in transition metal oxides. Our results can aid the theoretical interpretation of experiments on these materials, which often fall in a regime of intermediate coupling with respect to electron-electron interactions.",17,[],8
1705.04450,cond-mat,"Motivated by dimensional crossover in layered organic equation salts, we determine the phase diagram of a system of four periodically coupled Hubbard chains with frustration at half filling as a function of the interchain hopping equation and interaction strength equation at a fixed ratio of frustration and interchain hopping equation. We cover the range from the one-dimensional limit of uncoupled chains (equation) to the isotropic model (equation). For strong equation, we find an antiferromagnetic insulator; in the weak-to-moderate-interaction regime, the phase diagram features quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnetic behavior, an incommensurate spin-density wave, and a metallic phase as equation is increased. We characterize the phases through their magnetic ordering, dielectric response, and dominant static correlations. Our analysis is based primarily on a variant of the density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm based on an efficient hybrid-real-momentum-space formulation, in which we can treat relatively large lattices albeit of a limited width. This is complemented by a variational cluster approximation study with a cluster geometry corresponding to the cylindrical lattice allowing us to directly compare the two methods for this geometry. As an outlook, we make contact with work studying dimensional crossover in the full two-dimensional system.",17,[],8
1703.00671,cond-mat,"Monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) exhibit excellent electronic and optical properties. However, the performance of these two-dimensional (2D) devices are often limited by the large resistance offered by the metal contact interface. Till date, the carrier injection mechanism from metal to 2D TMDC layers remains unclear, with widely varying reports of Schottky barrier height (SBH) and contact resistance (Rc), particularly in the monolayer limit. In this work, we use a combination of theory and experiments in Au and Ni contacted monolayer MoS2 device to conclude the following points: (i) the carriers are injected at the source contact through a cascade of two potential barriers - the barrier heights being determined by the degree of interaction between the metal and the TMDC layer; (ii) the conventional Richardson equation becomes invalid due to the multi-dimensional nature of the injection barriers, and using Bardeen-Tersoff theory, we derive the appropriate form of the Richardson equation that describes such composite barrier; (iii) we propose a novel transfer length method (TLM) based SBH extraction methodology, to reliably extract SBH by eliminating any confounding effect of temperature dependent channel resistance variation; (iv) we derive the Landauer limit of the contact resistance achievable in such devices. A comparison of the limits with the experimentally achieved contact resistance reveals plenty of room for technological improvements.",17,[],8
1704.01604,cond-mat,"Phagraphene is a novel 2D carbon allotrope with interesting electronic properties which has been recently theoretically proposed. Phagraphene is similar to a defective graphene structure with an arrangement of pentagonal, heptagonal and hexagonal rings. In this study we investigate thermal conductivity and mechanical properties of phagraphene using molecular dynamics simulations. Using the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics method, we found the thermal conductivity of phagraphene to be anisotropic, with room temperature values of equation W/m-K along the armchair direction and equation W/m-K along the zigzag direction. Both values are one order of magnitude smaller than pristine graphene. Analysis of phonon group velocities also shows a significant reduction in this quantity for phagraphene in comparison to graphene. By performing uniaxial tensile simulations, we studied the deformation process and mechanical response of phagraphene. We found that phagraphene exhibits a remarkable high tensile strength around equation GPa, whereas its elastic modulus is also anisotropic along in-plane directions, with values of equation GPa and equation GPa for armchair and zigzag directions respectively. The lower thermal conductivity of phagraphene along with its predicted electronic properties suggests that it could be a better candidate than graphene in future carbon-based thermoelectric devices.",17,[],8

Several BP schemes are investigated and their optimization with respect to the phaseless constraint is considered.

1709.09363,cond-mat,"Fluorine adatoms on graphene induce local changes in electronic and magnetic properties, and subtle correlation effects. We investigate the GGA and GGAU approaches as possible solutions to describe the magnetic moment and electronic band structure of graphene sheets with fluorine adatoms, and compare to experiments. We show that, due to a lack of strong electronic correlations, GGA fails to reproduce the measured magnetic moment in this structure. In particular, the GGA incorrectly predicts a nonmagnetic ground state with a zero band gap. On the other hand, GGAU is a computationally efficient tool which provides physically reasonable properties. Using Hubbard U and exchange J parameters of 5 eV and 0.1 eV provides a magnetic moment and optical gap in agreement with experiments. Our results imply that the magnetic moment observed in the experiment is injected by fluorine in carbon pz orbitals throughout the graphene sheet. The spin- orbit coupling (SOC) has almost no influence (ca. 2%) on the magnetism. No Rashba effect is detected and the magnetic moment induced by fluorine strongly dominates the electronic properties.

1708.00273,cond-mat,"The dynamic Mott insulator-to-metal transition (DMT) is key to many intriguing phenomena in condensed matter physics yet it remains nearly unexplored. The cleanest way to observe DMT, without the interference from disorder and other effects inherent to electronic and atomic systems, is to employ the vortex Mott states formed by superconducting vortices in a regular array of pinning sites. The applied electric current delocalizes vortices and drives the dynamic vortex Mott transition. Here we report the critical behavior of the vortex system as it crosses the DMT line, driven by either current or temperature. We find universal scaling with respect to both, expressed by the same scaling function and characterized by a single critical exponent coinciding with the exponent for the thermodynamic Mott transition. We develop a theory for the DMT based on the parity reflection-time reversal (PT) symmetry breaking formalism and find that the nonequilibrium-induced Mott transition has the same critical behavior as thermal Mott transition. Our findings demonstrate the existence of physical systems in which the effect of nonequilibrium drive is to generate effective temperature and hence the transition belonging in the thermal universality class. We establish PT symmetry-breaking as a universal mechanism for out-of-equilibrium phase transitions.",17,[],8

Deformation is modeled with classical molecular dynamic simulations, validated from our first-principles data. We predict complex solid-solution alloys of improved stability with greatly enhanced modulus of elasticity (equation at 300 K) over near-equiatomic cases, as validated experimentally, and with higher moduli above 500~K over commercial alloys (equation at 2000 K).

The graphene/WS 2 system is found to maximize spin proximity effects compared to graphene on MoS 2 , WSe 2 , or MoSe 2 , with a crucial role played by disorder, given the disappearance of SHE signals in the presence of strong intervalley scattering.

The dephasing rates scale quadratically with the external strain and are inversely proportional to the Rabi frequency.

This lattice provides an excellent platform for hosting exotic quantum topological states. We observe a negative magnetoresistance that is consistent with the chiral anomaly expected from the presence of Weyl fermions close to the Fermi level. The anomalous Hall conductivity is robust against both increased temperature and charge conductivity, which corroborates the intrinsic Berry-curvature mechanism in momentum space. Owing to the low carrier density in this material and the significantly enhanced Berry curvature from its band structure, the anomalous Hall conductivity and the anomalous Hall angle simultaneously reach 1130 S cm-1 and 20%, respectively, an order of magnitude larger than typical magnetic systems.

This procedure yields an infinite hierarchy of kinetic equations that we terminate by employing a well-established closure strategy, developed in the pattern-formation community and based on a power-counting argument. We thus arrive at a closed set of coupled equations for slowly varying local density and orientation of the microtubules, and study its behaviour by performing a linear stability analysis and direct numerical simulations.

1704.07818,cond-mat,"Due to the interaction between topological defects of an order parameter and underlying fermions, the defects can possess induced fermion numbers, leading to several exotic phenomena of fundamental importance to both condensed matter and high energy physics. One of the intriguing outcome of induced fermion number is the presence of fluctuating competing orders inside the core of topological defect. In this regard, the interaction between fermions and skyrmion excitations of antiferromagnetic phase can have important consequence for understanding the global phase diagrams of many condensed matter systems where antiferromagnetism and several singlet orders compete. We critically investigate the relation between fluctuating competing orders and skyrmion excitations of the antiferromagnetic insulating phase of a half-filled Kondo-Heisenberg model on honeycomb lattice. By combining analytical and numerical methods we obtain exact eigenstates of underlying Dirac fermions in the presence of a single skyrmion configuration, which are used for computing induced chiral charge.

Based on the computed susceptibilities we establish spin Peierls and Kondo singlets as dominant competing orders of antiferromagnetism. We show favorable agreement between our findings and field theoretic predictions based on perturbative gradient expansion scheme which crucially relies on adiabatic principle and plane wave eigenstates for Dirac fermions.

This article investigates an emergent symmetry in the fractional quantum Hall effect, namely the PH symmetry of \em composite fermions, which relates states at composite fermion filling factors equation and equation, where the integer equation is the equation level index and equation. Detailed calculations using the microscopic theory of composite fermions demonstrate that for low lying equation levels (small equation): (i) the 2-body interaction between composite-fermion particles is very similar, apart from a constant additive term and an overall scale factor, to that between composite-fermion holes in the same equation level; and (ii) the 3-body interaction for composite fermions is an order of magnitude smaller than the 2-body interaction. Taken together, these results imply an approximate PH symmetry for composite fermions in low equation levels, which is also supported by exact diagonalization studies and available experiments. This symmetry, which relates states at electron filling factors equation and equation, is not present in the original Hamiltonian and owes its existence entirely to the formation of composite fermions.

While in the magnetically ordered phase the MR is positive and its magnitude increases with decreasing temperatures, in the paramagnetic regime the MR becomes vanishingly small. Above the spin density wave transition temperature (equation) the Hall coefficient equation is negative, small and weakly temperature dependent, but a remarkable change of slope occurs in the equation versus equation curves at equation. The Hall coefficient amplitude, while remaining negative, increases steadily and significantly as the temperature is decreased below equation and down to equation 20 K.

A long sought-after example is the melting of a Wigner Crystal (WC)~\citeWigner1934Interaction of electrons. Detection efforts have targeted distinctive collective modes such as pinning by disorder, resonant-frequency absorption of Goldstone modes, and melting transition. However, only one-step second-order melting of softly-pinned modes was reported. Without the evidence of genuine pinning as exhibited in the charge density waves (CDWs)~\citePinningCDW, these modes are likely intermediate phases which are only part of a complete SLT. To verify if there is a WC-intermediate phase transition will not only provide a solid proof of a WC, but will also unveil the nature of the SLT in relation to the two-stage Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) model~\citeKosterlitz1972Long,Kosterlitz1973Ordering,Halperin1978Theory,Nelson1979Dislocation,hexaticceperley,hexaticnelson, Young1979Melting. %(or dislocation pairs) above a critical temperature equation.

1701.08013,cond-mat,"Frictional properties of contacts between a smooth viscoelastic rubber and rigid surfaces are investigated using a torsional contact configuration where a glass lens is continuously rotated on the rubber surface. From the inversion of the displacement field measured at the surface of the rubber, spatially resolved values of the steady state frictional shear stress are determined within the non homogeneous pressure and velocity fields of the contact. For contacts with a smooth lens, a velocity dependent but pressure independent local shear stress is retrieved from the inversion. On the other hand, the local shear stress is found to depend both on velocity and applied contact pressure when a randomly rough (sand blasted) glass lens is rubbed against the rubber surface. As a result of changes in the density of micro-asperity contacts, the amount of light transmitted by the transparent multi-contact interface is observed to vary locally as a function of both contact pressure and sliding velocity. Under the assumption that the intensity of light transmitted by the rough interface is proportional to the proportion of area into contact, it is found that the local frictional stress can be expressed experimentally as the product of a purely velocity dependent term, equation, by a term representing the pressure and velocity dependence of the actual contact area, equation. A comparison between equation and the frictional shear stress of smooth contacts suggests that nanometer scale dissipative processes occurring at the interface predominate over viscoelastic dissipation at micro-asperity scale.",17,[],8

To this end, atomic configurations of a-Si:H with 72 and 576 atoms respectively are generated using molecular dynamics. Density functional theory calculations are then applied to these configurations to obtain the electronic wave functions. These are analyzed and characterized with respect to their localization and their contribution to the density of states, and are used for calculating ab-initio absorption spectra of a-Si:H. The results show that both the size and the defect structure of the configurations modify the electronic and optical properties and in particular the value of the band gap. This value could be improved by calculating quasi-particle (QP) corrections to the single-particle spectra using the GequationWequation method. We find that the QP corrections can be described by a set of scissors shift parameters, which can also be used in calculations of larger structures.",17,[],8

Single crystals of equation--FeSe are cleaved under ultra-high vacuum conditions and are subsequently measured below and above the nematic transition temperature. In total we observe five phonon modes and a phonon cutoff energy of about 40 meV. We identify the origin of each phonon mode based on the selection rules of HREELS and by comparing the experimental results to the ones of \emphab initio density functional calculations. The most prominent phonon modes equation, equation, and equation appear at energies of about equation and equation and equation meV, respectively. These phonon modes disperse rather weakly while changing the momentum from zero up to the zone boundary, indicating that they are mainly of optical nature. A comparison between our results and the results of \emphab initio calculations indicates that there must be a mutual interplay between magnetism and lattice dynamics in this compound, similar to the other Fe-based superconductors. Finally, we comment on the role of temperature on the phonon modes probed at the equation--point. It is observed that both the equation and equation phonon modes undergo a downward shift while increasing the temperature from 15 to 300 K. In the case of the equation mode this shift is about 1.5 meV.",17,[],8

Furthermore, the surface step changes non-trivially the transport properties both in the proximity-induced superconducting order parameter and the Josephson effect, depending on the step height.

For these phases, the two layers are connected with Si-Si covalent bonds. Transformation between \alpha- and letter-phases is difficult because of the high energy barrier. Phonon spectra of both \alpha- and letter-phase suggest their thermodynamic stabilities, because no phonon mode with imaginary frequency is present. By Contrast, letter-phase is unstable because phonon modes with imaginary frequencies are found along letter-Y path in the Brilliouin zone. Both \alpha- and letter-phase are semiconductor with narrow fundamental indirect band gap of 1.7eV and 1.9eV, respectively.

1708.06017,cond-mat,"Machine learning (ML) of quantum mechanical properties shows promise for accelerating chemical discovery. For transition metal chemistry where accurate calculations are computationally costly and available training data sets are small, the molecular representation becomes a critical ingredient in ML model predictive accuracy. We introduce a series of revised autocorrelation functions (RACs) that encode relationships between the heuristic atomic properties (e.g., size, connectivity, and electronegativity) on a molecular graph. We alter the starting point, scope, and nature of the quantities evaluated in standard ACs to make these RACs amenable to inorganic chemistry. On an organic molecule set, we first demonstrate superior standard AC performance to other presently-available topological descriptors for ML model training, with mean unsigned errors (MUEs) for atomization energies on set-aside test molecules as low as 6 kcal/mol. For inorganic chemistry, our RACs yield 1 kcal/mol ML MUEs on set-aside test molecules in spin-state splitting in comparison to 15-20x higher errors from feature sets that encode whole-molecule structural information. Systematic feature selection methods including univariate filtering, recursive feature elimination, and direct optimization (e.g., random forest and LASSO) are compared. Random-forest- or LASSO-selected subsets 4-5x smaller than RAC-155 produce sub- to 1-kcal/mol spin-splitting MUEs, with good transferability to metal-ligand bond length prediction (0.004-5 \AA MUE) and redox potential on a smaller data set (0.2-0.3 eV MUE).

The observed temperature-induced changes in the terahertz conductivity spectra are shown to depend strongly on the average CNT length, with a conductivity around 1 THz that increases/decreases as the temperature increases for short/long tubes. This behaviour originates from the temperature dependence of the electron scattering rate, which we obtain from Drude fits of the measured conductivity in the range 0.3-2 THz for 10 equationm length CNTs. This increasing scattering rate with temperature results in a subsequent broadening of the observed THz conductivity peak at higher temperatures and a shift to lower frequencies for increasing CNT length. Finally, we show that the change in conductivity with temperature depends not only on tube length, but also varies with tube density. We record the effective conductivities of composite films comprising mixtures of WSequation nanotubes and CNTs vs CNT density for frequencies in the range 0.3-1 THz, finding that the conductivity increases/decreases for low/high density films as the temperature increases. This effect arises due to the density dependence of the effective length of conducting pathways in the composite films, which again leads to a shift and temperature dependent broadening of the THz conductivity peak.",17,[],8

The tilted alternating magnetic field induces asymmetric expansion and shrinkage of the magnetic bubbles under the influence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, resulting in continuous shift of the bubbles in time. By realizing the magnetic bubblecade in PtCoPt films, we find that the bubblecade speed is sensitive to the tilt angle with a maximum at an angle, which can be explained well by a simple analytical form within the context of the domain-wall creep theory.

Contrary to the topological insulators or Dirac semimetals where XMR is linearly dependent on the field, in WTeequation and MoTeequation the XMR is nonlinearly dependent on the field, suggesting an entirely different mechanism. Electron-hole compensation has been proposed as a mechanism of this nonsaturating XMR in WTeequation, while it is yet to be clear in the case of MoTeequation which has an identical crystal structure of WTeequation at low temperatures. In this paper, we report low-energy electronic structure and Fermi surface topology of MoTeequation using angle-resolved photoemission spectrometry (ARPES) technique and first-principle calculations, and compare them with that of WTeequation to understand the mechanism of XMR. Our measurements demonstrate that MoTeequation is an uncompensated semimetal, contrary to WTeequation in which compensated electron-hole pockets have been identified, ruling out the applicability of charge compensation theory for the nonsaturating XMR in MoTeequation. In this context, we also discuss the applicability of the existing other conjectures on the XMR of these compounds.",17,[],8
1705.06250,cs,"Spectral shape descriptors have been used extensively in a broad spectrum of geometry processing applications ranging from shape retrieval and segmentation to classification. In this pa- per, we propose a spectral graph wavelet approach for 3D shape classification using the bag-of-features paradigm. In an effort to capture both the local and global geometry of a 3D shape, we present a three-step feature description framework. First, local descriptors are extracted via the spectral graph wavelet transform having the Mexican hat wavelet as a generating ker- nel. Second, mid-level features are obtained by embedding lo- cal descriptors into the visual vocabulary space using the soft- assignment coding step of the bag-of-features model. Third, a global descriptor is constructed by aggregating mid-level fea- tures weighted by a geodesic exponential kernel, resulting in a matrix representation that describes the frequency of appearance of nearby codewords in the vocabulary. Experimental results on two standard 3D shape benchmarks demonstrate the effective- ness of the proposed classification approach in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.",17,[],7

1710.01559,cs,"This paper investigates the automatic monitoring of tool usage during a surgery, with potential applications in report generation, surgical training and real-time decision support. Two surgeries are considered: cataract surgery, the most common surgical procedure, and cholecystectomy, one of the most common digestive surgeries. Tool usage is monitored in videos recorded either through a microscope (cataract surgery) or an endoscope (cholecystectomy). Following state-of-the-art video analysis solutions, each frame of the video is analyzed by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) whose outputs are fed to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in order to take temporal relationships between events into account. Novelty lies in the way those CNNs and RNNs are trained. Computational complexity prevents the end-to-end training of ""CNNRNN"" systems. Therefore, CNNs are usually trained first, independently from the RNNs. This approach is clearly suboptimal for surgical tool analysis: many tools are very similar to one another, but they can generally be differentiated based on past events. CNNs should be trained to extract the most useful visual features in combination with the temporal context. A novel boosting strategy is proposed to achieve this goal: the CNN and RNN parts of the system are simultaneously enriched by progressively adding weak classifiers (either CNNs or RNNs) trained to improve the overall classification accuracy. Experiments were performed in a dataset of 50 cataract surgery videos and a dataset of 80 cholecystectomy videos. Very good classification performance are achieved in both datasets: tool usage could be labeled with an average area under the ROC curve of equation and equation, respectively, in offline mode (using past, present and future information), and equation and equation, respectively, in online mode (using past and present information only).",17,[],7

We propose a novel 3D-based coarse-to-fine framework to effectively and efficiently tackle these challenges. The proposed 3D-based framework outperforms the 2D counterpart to a large margin since it can leverage the rich spatial infor- mation along all three axes. We conduct experiments on two datasets which include healthy and pathological pancreases respectively, and achieve the current state-of-the-art in terms of Dice-S\orensen Coefficient (DSC).

This approach reduces a 3D line segment fitting problem into two 2D line segment fitting problems and takes advantage of both images and depth maps. In our method, 3D line segments are fitted incrementally along detected edge segments via minimizing fitting errors on two planes. By clustering the detected line segments, the resulting 3D representation of the scene achieves a good balance between compactness and completeness. Our experimental results show that the 3D line segments generated by our method are highly accurate. As an application, we demonstrate that these line segments greatly improve the quality of 3D surface reconstruction compared to a feature point based baseline.",17,[],7
1705.10259,cs,"In future intelligent transportation systems, networked vehicles coordinate with each other to achieve safe operations based on an assumption that communications among vehicles and infrastructure are reliable. Traditional methods usually deal with the design of control systems and communication networks in a separated manner. However, control and communication systems are tightly coupled as the motions of vehicles will affect the overall communication quality. Hence, we are motivated to study the co-design of both control and communication systems. In particular, we propose a control theoretical framework for distributed motion planning for multi-agent systems which satisfies complex and high-level spatial and temporal specifications while accounting for communication quality at the same time. Towards this end, desired motion specifications and communication performances are formulated as signal temporal logic (STL) and spatial-temporal logic (SpaTeL) formulas, respectively. The specifications are encoded as constraints on system and environment state variables of mixed integer linear programs (MILP), and upon which control strategies satisfying both STL and SpaTeL specifications are generated for each agent by employing a distributed model predictive control (MPC) framework. Effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated by a simulation of distributed communication-aware motion planning for multi-agent systems.",17,[],7

1704.06972,cs,"Recently, there has been a lot of interest in automatically generating descriptions for an image. Most existing language-model based approaches for this task learn to generate an image description word by word in its original word order. However, for humans, it is more natural to locate the objects and their relationships first, and then elaborate on each object, describing notable attributes. We present a coarse-to-fine method that decomposes the original image description into a skeleton sentence and its attributes, and generates the skeleton sentence and attribute phrases separately. By this decomposition, our method can generate more accurate and novel descriptions than the previous state-of-the-art. Experimental results on the MS-COCO and a larger scale Stock3M datasets show that our algorithm yields consistent improvements across different evaluation metrics, especially on the SPICE metric, which has much higher correlation with human ratings than the conventional metrics. Furthermore, our algorithm can generate descriptions with varied length, benefiting from the separate control of the skeleton and attributes. This enables image description generation that better accommodates user preferences.",17,[],7

We further exploit the rich professional photographs on the web to mine unlimited high-quality ranking samples and demonstrate that an aesthetics-aware deep ranking network can be trained without explicitly modeling any photographic rules. The resulting model is simple and effective in terms of its architectural design and data sampling method. It is also generic since it naturally learns any photographic rules implicitly encoded in professional photographs.

A representation is needed for how much the machine's policy will prioritize each player's interests over time. Assuming the players have reached common knowledge of their situation, this paper derives a recursion that any Pareto optimal policy must satisfy. Two qualitative observations can be made from the recursion: the machine must (1) use each player's own beliefs in evaluating how well an action will serve that player's utility function, and (2) shift the relative priority it assigns to each player's expected utilities over time, by a factor proportional to how well that player's beliefs predict the machine's inputs.

For example, when modeling medical features across a set of patients, the number and duration of treatments may vary widely in time, meaning there is no meaningful way to align their clinical records across time points for analysis purposes. To handle such data, the state-of-the-art tensor model is the so-called PARAFAC2, which yields interpretable and robust output and can naturally handle sparse data. However, its main limitation up to now has been the lack of efficient algorithms that can handle large-scale datasets.   In this work, we fill this gap by developing a scalable method to compute the PARAFAC2 decomposition of large and sparse datasets, called SPARTan. Our method exploits special structure within PARAFAC2, leading to a novel algorithmic reformulation that is both fast (in absolute time) and more memory-efficient than prior work. We evaluate SPARTan on both synthetic and real datasets, showing 22X performance gains over the best previous implementation and also handling larger problem instances for which the baseline fails.

We use instead a flow-based local algorithm and suitably adjust their framework to work with our flow-based subroutine. Both flow and diffusion based methods have a long history of being applied to finding low conductance cuts. Diffusion algorithms have several variants that are naturally local while it is more complicated to make flow methods local.

In this paper, we turn to software-defined networking and develop a novel general-purpose multi-failure protection algorithm to provide quick failure recovery, via Fast Failover (FF) groups, for dynamic multicast groups. This extends previous research, which either could not realize fast failover, worked only for single link failures, or was only applicable to static multicast groups.

However, high percentiles of the total processor usage (summed over at least 10 tasks) can be reasonably estimated by the Gaussian distribution. We use this result for a probabilistic fit test, called the Gaussian Percentile Approximation (GPA), for standard bin-packing algorithms. To check whether a new task will fit into a machine, GPA checks whether the resulting distribution's percentile corresponding to the requested service level objective, SLO is still below the machine's capacity. In our simulation experiments, GPA resulted in colocations exceeding the machines' capacity with a frequency similar to the requested SLO.",17,[],7
1710.06515,cs,"This paper presents an approach to lemma synthesis to support advanced inductive entailment procedures based on separation logic. We first propose a mechanism where lemmas are automatically proven and systematically applied. The lemmas may include universal guard and/or unknown predicate. While the former is critical for expressivity, the latter is essential for supporting relationships between multiple predicates. We further introduce lemma synthesis to support (i) automated inductive reasoning together with frame inference and (ii) theorem exploration. For (i) we automatically discover and prove auxiliary lemmas during an inductive proof; and for (ii) we automatically generate a useful set of lemmas to relate user-defined or system-generated predicates. We have implemented our proposed approach into an existing verification system and tested its capability in inductive reasoning and theorem exploration. The experimental results show that the enhanced system can automatically synthesize useful lemmas to facilitate reasoning on a broad range of non-trivial inductive proofs.",17,[],7
1707.08160,cs,"A wide variety of online platforms use digital badges to encourage users to take certain types of desirable actions. However, despite their growing popularity, their causal effect on users' behavior is not well understood. This is partly due to the lack of counterfactual data and the myriad of complex factors that influence users' behavior over time. As a consequence, their design and deployment lacks general principles.   In this paper, we focus on first-time badges, which are awarded after a user takes a particular type of action for the first time, and study their causal effect by harnessing the delayed introduction of several badges in a popular Q&A website. In doing so, we introduce a novel causal inference framework for badges whose main technical innovations are a robust survival-based hypothesis testing procedure, which controls for the utility heterogeneity across users, and a bootstrap difference-in-differences method, which controls for the random fluctuations in users' behavior over time. We find that first-time badges steer users' behavior if the utility a user obtains from taking the corresponding action is sufficiently low, otherwise, the badge does not have a significant effect. Moreover, for badges that successfully steered user behavior, we perform a counterfactual analysis and show that they significantly improved the functioning of the site at a community level.",17,[],7

1712.03366,cs,"In this work, we propose a hybrid parallel Jaya optimisation algorithm for a multi-core environment with the aim of solving large-scale global optimisation problems. The proposed algorithm is called HHCPJaya, and combines the hyper-population approach with the hierarchical cooperation search mechanism. The HHCPJaya algorithm divides the population into many small subpopulations, each of which focuses on a distinct block of the original population dimensions. In the hyper-population approach, we increase the small subpopulations by assigning more than one subpopulation to each core, and each subpopulation evolves independently to enhance the explorative and exploitative nature of the population. We combine this hyper-population approach with the two-level hierarchical cooperative search scheme to find global solutions from all subpopulations. Furthermore, we incorporate an additional updating phase on the respective subpopulations based on global solutions, with the aim of further improving the convergence rate and the quality of solutions. Several experiments applying the proposed parallel algorithm in different settings prove that it demonstrates sufficient promise in terms of the quality of solutions and the convergence rate. Furthermore, a relatively small computational effort is required to solve complex and large-scale optimisation problems.",17,[],7
1705.10396,cs,"We pursue a study of the Generalized Demand Matching problem, a common generalization of the equation-Matching and Knapsack problems. Here, we are given a graph with vertex capacities, edge profits, and asymmetric demands on the edges. The goal is to find a maximum-profit subset of edges so the demands of chosen edges do not violate vertex capacities. This problem is APX-hard and constant-factor approximations are known.   Our results fall into two categories. First, using iterated relaxation and various filtering strategies, we show with an efficient rounding algorithm if an additional matroid structure equation is given and we further only allow sets equation that are independent in equation, the natural LP relaxation has an integrality gap of at most equation. This can be improved in various special cases, for example we improve over the 15-approximation for the previously-studied Coupled Placement problem [Korupolu et al. 2014] by giving a equation-approximation.   Using similar techniques, we show the problem of computing a minimum-cost base in equation satisfying vertex capacities admits a equation-bicriteria approximation. This improves over the previous equation-approximation in the special case that equation is the graphic matroid over the given graph [Fukanaga and Nagamochi, 2009].   Second, we show Demand Matching admits a polynomial-time approximation scheme in graphs that exclude a fixed minor. If all demands are polynomially-bounded integers, this is somewhat easy using dynamic programming in bounded-treewidth graphs. Our main technical contribution is a sparsification lemma allowing us to scale the demands to be used in a more intricate dynamic programming algorithm, followed by randomized rounding to filter our scaled-demand solution to a feasible solution.",17,[],7

1708.05655,cs,"In this paper, we propose a new multi-objective contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem with two objectives, where one of the objectives dominates the other objective. Unlike single-objective MAB problems in which the learner obtains a random scalar reward for each arm it selects, in the proposed problem, the learner obtains a random reward vector, where each component of the reward vector corresponds to one of the objectives and the distribution of the reward depends on the context that is provided to the learner at the beginning of each round. We call this problem contextual multi-armed bandit with a dominant objective (CMAB-DO). In CMAB-DO, the goal of the learner is to maximize its total reward in the non-dominant objective while ensuring that it maximizes its total reward in the dominant objective. In this case, the optimal arm given a context is the one that maximizes the expected reward in the non-dominant objective among all arms that maximize the expected reward in the dominant objective. First, we show that the optimal arm lies in the Pareto front. Then, we propose the multi-objective contextual multi-armed bandit algorithm (MOC-MAB), and define two performance measures: the 2-dimensional (2D) regret and the Pareto regret. We show that both the 2D regret and the Pareto regret of MOC-MAB are sublinear in the number of rounds. We also compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with other state-of-the-art methods in synthetic and real-world datasets. The proposed model and the algorithm have a wide range of real-world applications that involve multiple and possibly conflicting objectives ranging from wireless communication to medical diagnosis and recommender systems.",17,[],7

1706.04404,cs,"The usage of process choreographies and decentralized Business Process Management Systems has been named as an alternative to centralized business process orchestration. In choreographies, control over a process instance is shared between independent parties, and no party has full control or knowledge during process runtime. Nevertheless, it is necessary to monitor and verify process instances during runtime for purposes of documentation, accounting, or compensation.   To achieve business process runtime verification, this work explores the suitability of the Bitcoin blockchain to create a novel solution for choreographies. The resulting approach is realized in a fully-functional software prototype. This software solution is evaluated in a qualitative comparison. Findings show that our blockchain-based approach enables a seamless execution monitoring and verification of choreographies, while at the same time preserving anonymity and independence of the process participants.

We apply our techniques to the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains; our solution applies to any proof-of-work-based blockchain that relies on a numeric target for the validation of blocks. We also show that if miners regularly broadcast status reports of their partial proof-of- work, the hash rate estimates are signi cantly more accurate at a cost of slightly higher bandwidth. Whether using only the blockchain, or the additional information in status reports, merchants can use our techniques to quantify in real-time the threat of double-spend attacks.",17,[],7
1710.11573,cs,"As neural networks grow deeper and wider, learning networks with hard-threshold activations is becoming increasingly important, both for network quantization, which can drastically reduce time and energy requirements, and for creating large integrated systems of deep networks, which may have non-differentiable components and must avoid vanishing and exploding gradients for effective learning. However, since gradient descent is not applicable to hard-threshold functions, it is not clear how to learn networks of them in a principled way. We address this problem by observing that setting targets for hard-threshold hidden units in order to minimize loss is a discrete optimization problem, and can be solved as such. The discrete optimization goal is to find a set of targets such that each unit, including the output, has a linearly separable problem to solve. Given these targets, the network decomposes into individual perceptrons, which can then be learned with standard convex approaches. Based on this, we develop a recursive mini-batch algorithm for learning deep hard-threshold networks that includes the popular but poorly justified straight-through estimator as a special case. Empirically, we show that our algorithm improves classification accuracy in a number of settings, including for AlexNet and ResNet-18 on ImageNet, when compared to the straight-through estimator.",17,[],7

Previous work has focused on unanimous fairness, in which all agents in each group must agree that their group's share is fair. Under this strict requirement, fair allocations exist only for small groups. We introduce the concept of democratic fairness, which aims to satisfy a certain fraction of the agents in each group. This concept is better suited to large groups such as cities or countries. We present protocols for democratic fair allocation among two or more arbitrarily large groups of agents with monotonic, additive, or binary valuations. For two groups with arbitrary monotonic valuations, we give an efficient protocol that guarantees envy-freeness up to one good for at least equation of the agents in each group, and prove that the equation fraction is optimal. We also present other protocols that make weaker fairness guarantees to more agents in each group, or to more groups. Our protocols combine techniques from different fields, including combinatorial game theory, cake cutting, and voting.",17,[],7
1710.10574,cs,"Distributed word representations have been shown to be very useful in various natural language processing (NLP) application tasks. These word vectors learned from huge corpora very often carry both semantic and syntactic information of words. However, it is well known that each individual user has his own language patterns because of different factors such as interested topics, friend groups, social activities, wording habits, etc., which may imply some kind of personalized semantics. With such personalized semantics, the same word may imply slightly differently for different users. For example, the word ""Cappuccino"" may imply ""Leisure"", ""Joy"", ""Excellent"" for a user enjoying coffee, by only a kind of drink for someone else. Such personalized semantics of course cannot be carried by the standard universal word vectors trained with huge corpora produced by many people. In this paper, we propose a framework to train different personalized word vectors for different users based on the very successful continuous skip-gram model using the social network data posted by many individual users. In this framework, universal background word vectors are first learned from the background corpora, and then adapted by the personalized corpus for each individual user to learn the personalized word vectors. We use two application tasks to evaluate the quality of the personalized word vectors obtained in this way, the user prediction task and the sentence completion task. These personalized word vectors were shown to carry some personalized semantics and offer improved performance on these two evaluation tasks.",17,[],7

The largely invisible market activities and their complex interactions could especially make Cloud consumers hesitate to enter the spot market. To reduce the complexity in understanding the Cloud spot market, we decided to reveal the backend information behind spot price variations. Inspired by the methodology of reverse engineering, we developed a Predator-Prey model that can simulate the interactions between demand and resource based on the visible spot price traces. The simulation results have shown some basic regular patterns of market activities with respect to Amazon's spot instance type m3.large.

In this paper, we have proposed an energy efficient WLAN discovery scheme for 3GPP LTE and IEEE 802.11 WLAN inter-working scenario. User Equipment (UE), in the proposed scheme, uses 3GPP network assistance along with the results of past channel scans, to optimally select the next channels to scan.

1705.03639,cs,"We study the sparsity and optimality properties of crowd navigation and find that existing techniques do not satisfy both criteria simultaneously: either they achieve optimality with a prohibitive number of samples or tractability assumptions make them fragile to catastrophe. For example, if the human and robot are modeled independently, then tractability is attained but the planner is prone to overcautious or overaggressive behavior. For sampling based motion planning of joint human-robot cost functions, for equation agents and equation step lookahead, equation samples are needed for coverage of the action space. Advanced approaches statically partition the action space into free-space and then sample in those convex regions. However, if the human is \emphmoving into free-space, then the partition is misleading and sampling is unsafe: free space will soon be occupied. We diagnose the cause of these deficiencies---optimization happens over \emphtrajectory space---and propose a novel solution: optimize over trajectory \emphdistribution space by using a Gaussian process (GP) basis. We exploit the ""kernel trick"" of GPs, where a continuum of trajectories are captured with a mean and covariance function. By using the mean and covariance as proxies for a trajectory family we reason about collective trajectory behavior without resorting to sampling. The GP basis is sparse and optimal with respect to collision avoidance and robot and crowd intention and flexibility. GP sparsity leans heavily on the insight that joint action space decomposes into free regions; however, the decomposition contains feasible solutions only if the partition is dynamically generated. We call our approach \emphequation-sparse interacting Gaussian processes.",17,[],7
1705.07844,cs,"In the context of scene understanding, a variety of methods exists to estimate different information channels from mono or stereo images, including disparity, depth, and normals. Although several advances have been reported in the recent years for these tasks, the estimated information is often imprecise particularly near depth discontinuities or creases. Studies have however shown that precisely such depth edges carry critical cues for the perception of shape, and play important roles in tasks like depth-based segmentation or foreground selection. Unfortunately, the currently extracted channels often carry conflicting signals, making it difficult for subsequent applications to effectively use them. In this paper, we focus on the problem of obtaining high-precision depth edges (i.e., depth contours and creases) by jointly analyzing such unreliable information channels. We propose DepthCut, a data-driven fusion of the channels using a convolutional neural network trained on a large dataset with known depth. The resulting depth edges can be used for segmentation, decomposing a scene into depth layers with relatively flat depth, or improving the accuracy of the depth estimate near depth edges by constraining its gradients to agree with these edges. Quantitatively, we compare against 15 variants of baselines and demonstrate that our depth edges result in an improved segmentation performance and an improved depth estimate near depth edges compared to data-agnostic channel fusion.

To obtain repeated rapid convergence, we leverage recent work on cyclic learning rate schedules.

Which networks blindly accept invalid routes? Which reject them outright? Which de-preference them if alternatives exist?   Recent analysis attempts to use uncontrolled experiments to characterize ROV adoption by comparing valid routes and invalid routes. However, we argue that gaining a solid understanding of ROV adoption is impossible using currently available data sets and techniques. Our measurements suggest that, although some ISPs are not observed using invalid routes in uncontrolled experiments, they are actually using different routes for (non-security) traffic engineering purposes, without performing ROV.

In order to model several degrees of color blindness, herein this work we modified the classical linear transform-based simulation method by the use of fuzzy parameters. We also proposed four new methods to correct color blindness based on a fuzzy approach: Methods A and B, with and without histogram equalization. All the methods are based on combinations of linear transforms and histogram operations. In order to evaluate the results we implemented a web-based survey to get the best results according to optimize to distinguish different elements in an image. Results obtained from 40 volunteers proved that the Method B with histogram equalization got the best results for about 47% of volunteers.",17,[],7
1709.00103,cs,"A significant amount of the world's knowledge is stored in relational databases. However, the ability for users to retrieve facts from a database is limited due to a lack of understanding of query languages such as SQL. We propose Seq2SQL, a deep neural network for translating natural language questions to corresponding SQL queries. Our model leverages the structure of SQL queries to significantly reduce the output space of generated queries. Moreover, we use rewards from in-the-loop query execution over the database to learn a policy to generate unordered parts of the query, which we show are less suitable for optimization via cross entropy loss. In addition, we will publish WikiSQL, a dataset of 80654 hand-annotated examples of questions and SQL queries distributed across 24241 tables from Wikipedia. This dataset is required to train our model and is an order of magnitude larger than comparable datasets. By applying policy-based reinforcement learning with a query execution environment to WikiSQL, our model Seq2SQL outperforms attentional sequence to sequence models, improving execution accuracy from 35.9% to 59.4% and logical form accuracy from 23.4% to 48.3%.",17,[],7

In this paper, we present the generic optimization framework that we have designed for mlpack. A key priority in the design was ease of implementation of both new optimizers and new objective functions to be optimized; therefore, implementation of a new optimizer requires only one method and implementation of a new objective function requires at most four functions. This leads to simple and intuitive code, which, for fast prototyping and experimentation, is of paramount importance.

1702.07002,cs,"While greedy algorithms have long been observed to perform well on a wide variety of problems, up to now approximation ratios have only been known for their application to problems having submodular objective functions equation. Since many practical problems have non-submodular equation, there is a critical need to devise new techniques to bound the performance of greedy algorithms in the case of non-submodularity.   Our primary contribution is the introduction of a novel technique for estimating the approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm for maximization of monotone non-decreasing functions based on the curvature of equation without relying on the submodularity constraint. We show that this technique reduces to the classical equation ratio for submodular functions. Furthermore, we develop an extension of this ratio to the adaptive greedy algorithm, which allows applications to non-submodular stochastic maximization problems.

Second, there is no extremal particle-black hole solution but quasi extremal charged particle-black holes at the best. We showed that the Hawking emission disrupts the condition of particle-black hole.

To this end, we first deduce the second post-Keplerian (2PK) Hamiltonian of the two-body problem from the known 2PK Lagrangian. We then build, by means of a canonical transformation a ST-deformation of the general relativistic EOB Hamiltonian which allows to incorporate the Scalar-Tensor (2PK) corrections to the currently best available General Relativity EOB results.

1712.03876,gr-qc,"We revisit the non-singular black hole solution in (extended) mimetic gravity with a limiting curvature from a Hamiltonian point of view. We introduce a parameterization of the phase space which allows us to describe fully the Hamiltonian structure of the theory. We write down the equations of motion that we solve in the regime deep inside the black hole, and we recover that the black hole has no singularity, due to the limiting curvature mechanism. Then, we study the relation between such black holes and effective polymer black holes which have been introduced in the context of loop quantum gravity. As expected, contrary to what happens in the cosmological sector, mimetic gravity with a limiting curvature fails to reproduce the usual effective dynamics of spherically symmetric loop quantum gravity which are generically not covariant. Nonetheless, we exhibit a theory in the class of extended mimetic gravity whose dynamics reproduces the general shape of the effective corrections of spherically symmetric polymer models, but in an undeformed covariant manner. These covariant effective corrections are found to be always metric dependent, i.e. within the equation-scheme, underlying the importance of this ingredient for inhomogeneous polymer models. In that respect, extended mimetic gravity can be viewed as an effective covariant theory which naturally implements a covariant notion of point wise holonomy-like corrections. The difference between the mimetic and polymer Hamiltonian formulations provides us with a guide to understand the deformation of covariance in inhomogeneous polymer models.",17,[],13

1710.01533,gr-qc,"As an attempt to solve the black hole information loss paradox, recently there has been the suggestion that, due to semi-classical effects, a pre-Hawking radiation must exist during the gravitational collapse of matter, which in turn prevents the apparent horizon from forming. Assuming the pre-Hawking radiation does exist, here we argue the opposite. First we note that the stress energy tensor near the horizon for the pre-Hawking radiation is far too small to do anything to the motion of a collapsing shell. Thus the shell will always cross the apparent horizon within a finite proper time. Moreovall, the amount of energy that can be radiated must be less than half of the total initial energy (if the particle starts at rest at infinity) before the shell becomes a null shell and cannot radiate any more without becoming tachyonic. We conclude that for any gravitational collapsing process within Einstein gravity and semi-classical quantum field theory, the formation of the apparent horizon is inevitable. Pre-Hawking radiation is therefore not a valid solution to the information paradox.",17,[],13

This allows us to identify the equilibrium states of the theory, as well as to derive constitutive relations and a Fourier-like law for the corresponding first-order theory heat flux.

1710.05188,gr-qc,"In this work we have derived the evolution equation for gravitational perturbation in four dimensional spacetime in presence of a spatial extra dimension. The evolution equation is derived by perturbing the \empheffective gravitational field equations on the four dimensional spacetime, which inherits non-trivial higher dimensional effects. Note that this is \emphdifferent from the perturbation of the five dimensional gravitational field equations, existing in literature, and possess quantitatively new features. The gravitational perturbation has further been decomposed into a purely four dimensional part and another piece that depends on extra dimensions. The four dimensional gravitational perturbation now admits massive propagating degrees of freedom, owing to the existence of higher dimensions. We have also studied the influence of these massive propagating modes on the quasi-normal mode frequencies, signaling the higher dimensional nature of the spacetime, and have contrasted these massive modes with the massless modes in general relativity. Surprisingly, it turns out that the massive modes experience much smaller damping compared to the massless modes in general relativity and may even \emphdominate over and above the general relativity contribution if one observes the ringdown phase of a black hole merger event at sufficiently late times. Furthermore, the whole analytical framework has been supplemented by the fully numerical Cauchy evolution problem as well.

1704.05794,gr-qc,"We consider the ""kinematics"" of spacelike congruences and apply them to a family of self-gravitating magnetic forcelines. Our aim is to investigate the convergence and the possible focusing of these lines, as well as their rotation and shear deformation. In so going, we introduce a covariant 12 splitting of the 3-dimensional space, parallel and orthogonal to the direction of the field lines. The convergence, or the divergence, of the latter is monitored by the associated Raychaudhuri equation, which is obtained by propagating the spatial divergence of a unitary spacelike vector along its own direction. Applied to a magnetic vector, the resulting expression shows that, although the convergence of the magnetic forcelines is affected by the gravitational pull of all the other sources, it is unaffected by the field's own gravity, irrespective of how strong the latter is. This rather counterintuitive result is entirely due to the magnetic tension, namely to the negative pressure the field exerts parallel to its lines of force. In particular, the magnetic tension always cancels out the field's energy-density input to the Raychaudhuri equation, leaving the latter free of any direct magnetic-energy contribution. Similarly, the rotation and the shear deformation of the aforementioned forcelines are also unaffected by the magnetic input to the total gravitational energy.

1710.00863,gr-qc,"We investigate instabilities and their regularization in theories of gravitation. Instabilities can be beneficial since their growth often leads to prominent observable signatures which makes them especially relevant to relatively low signal-to-noise ratio measurements such as gravitational wave detections. An indefinitely growing instability usually renders a theory unphysical, hence a desirable instability should also come with underlying physical machinery that stops the growth at finite values, i.e. regularization mechanisms. The prototypical gravity theory that presents such an instability is the spontaneous scalarization phenomena of scalar-tensor theories, which feature a tachyonic instability. We identify the regularization mechanisms in this theory, and show that they can be utilized to regularize other instabilities as well. Namely, we present theories where spontaneous growth is triggered by a ghost rather than a tachyon, and numerically calculate stationary solutions of scalarized neutron stars in these theories. We speculate on the possibility of regularizing known divergent instabilities in certain gravity theories using our findings, and discuss alternative theories of gravitation where regularized instabilities may be present.

Applying a novel result, we obtain a detailed balance relation for the macroscopic absorption of an astronomical object by an static spherically symmetric black hole.

This study shows, in particular, that a universe with a non-interacting three-parameter van der Waals fluid can evolve into a universe characterized by a Type IV~(Generalized Sudden) Singularity. On the other hand, for certain values of the parameters, exit from the accelerated expanding phase is possible in the near future, what means that the expansion of the universe in the future could become decelerated.

The amplitude and phase of the original model are appropriately stretched and rescaled using post-Newtonian results (for the inspiral), perturbation theory (for the ringdown), and a smooth transition between the two. No additional tuning to numerical-relativity simulations is required. We apply a variant of this method to the non-precessing PhenomD model.

The starting point of our paper is constituted by the general De~Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian of a system of scalar and vector fields, which is supposed to be form-invariant under (global) Lorentz transformations. Following the reasoning of gauge theories, the corresponding locally form-invariant system is worked out by means of canonical transformations. The canonical transformation approach ensures by construction that the form of the action functional is maintained. We thus encounter amended Hamiltonian systems which are form-invariant under arbitrary spacetime transformations. This amended system complies with the general principle of relativity and describes both, the dynamics of the given physical system's fields and their coupling to those quantities which describe the dynamics of the spacetime geometry. In this way, it is unambiguously determined how spin-0 and spin-1 fields couple to the dynamics of spacetime.   A term that describes the dynamics of the ""free"" gauge fields must finally be added to the amended Hamiltonian, as common to all gauge theories, to allow for a dynamic spacetime geometry. The choice of this ""dynamics"" Hamiltonian is outside of the scope of gauge theory as presented in this paper. It accounts for the remaining indefiniteness of any gauge theory of gravity and must be chosen ""by hand"" on the basis of physical reasoning.

The recent T2HKK proposal aims to improve the hierarchy sensitivity of T2HK by placing one of the two tanks of the HK detector at a site in Korea, to collect data at equation km baseline. In light of the fact that DUNE will anyway collect data at equation km, we explore whether it is advantageous to collect additional long-baseline data as proposed with T2HKK, or to enhance the equation-precision with the `conventional' T2HK by keeping both detector tanks in Japan. We do this by comparing the physics reach of these two options in conjunction with DUNE. We find that DUNET2HKK is better at excluding the wrong hierarchy, reaching equation irrespective of the true parameters. While DUNET2HK can measure equation with more precision in some parts of the parameter space, both DUNET2HK and DUNET2HKK perform equally well near the current best-fit point, giving a equation width of around equation. The T2HKK setup allows us to correlate and constrain the systematic errors between the two detectors collecting data from the same source, which can increase the sensitivity of the experiment by up to 25\%. Such a reduction of the systematic errors is crucial for determining the oscillation parameters with greater significance.",17,[],2
1710.03067,hep-ph,"We formulate rigorous criteria for selecting diagrams to be taken into account in the analysis of potential polyquark (tetra or penta) poles in QCD. The central point of these criteria is the requirement that the Feynman diagrams for the relevant Green functions contain four-quark (or, respectively, five-quark in the pentaquark case) intermediate states and the corresponding cuts. It is shown that some diagrams which ""visually"" seem to contain the four-quark cuts, turn out to be free of these singularities and therefore should not be taken into account when calculating the tetraquark properties. We then consider large-equation QCD which in many cases provide qualitatively correct picture of hadron properties and discuss in detail the tetraquark states. For the ""direct"" and the ""recombination"" four-point Green functions, which may potentially contain the tetraquark poles, we formulate large-equation consistency conditions which strongly restrict the behaviour of the tetraquark-to-ordinary meson transition amplitudes. In the end, these conditions allow us to obtain constraints on width of the potential tetraquark states at large equation. We report that both flavor-exotic and cryptoexotic (i.e., flavor-nonexotic) tetraquarks, if the corresponding poles exist, have a width of order equation, i.e. they should be parametrically narrower compared to the ordinary equation mesons with a width of order equation. Moreover, for flavor-exotic states, the large-equation consistency conditions require two narrow flavor-exotic states, each of these states coupling dominantly to one specific meson-meson channel.",17,[],2

The level of disagreement between the two is quantified by applying a Bayesian reweighting technique. This allows to infer the parton distributions needed in order to describe the pseudodata, which we find quite different from the actual distributions, especially for sea quarks and gluons. This tension suggests that, should saturation effects impact the future nuclear structure function data as predicted, a successful refitting of the nPDFs may not be achievable, which would unambiguously signal the presence of non-linear effects.",17,[],2

The three Higgs bosons of a 2HDM can be produced at the LHC either singly via gluon fusion or in pairs with each other. When analyzing their pair production, the emphasis is laid on gluon-initiated processes, and the electroweak (EW) production is generally not treated on the same footing, assuming its contribution to be highly subleading.

This is sufficient to endow the charged components with macroscopically-observable lifetimes, and ensure an electrically-neutral dark matter particle. We show that a commonly used iterative procedure to compute radiatively-corrected pole masses can lead to very different mass splittings than a non-iterative calculation at the same loop order. By estimating the uncertainties of the two one-loop results, we show that the iterative procedure is significantly more sensitive to the choice of renormalisation scale and gauge parameter than the non-iterative method. This can cause the lifetime of the charged component to vary by up to 12 orders of magnitude if iteration is employed. We show that individual pole masses exhibit similar scale-dependence regardless of the procedure, but that the leading scale-dependent terms cancel when computing the mass splitting if and only if the non-iterative procedure is employed. We show that this behaviour persists at two-loop order: the precision of the mass splitting improves in the non-iterative approach, but our results suggest that higher-order corrections do not reduce the uncertainty in the iterative calculation enough to resolve the problem at two-loop order. We conclude that the iterative procedure should not be used for computing pole masses in situations where electroweak mass splittings are phenomenologically relevant.",17,[],2

The Standard Model Higgs field is a mixture of an elementary scalar and composite scalars in a new strongly-coupled gauge theory, and the strong dynamics gives rise to the negative mass for the SM Higgs field, and at the same time, causes separation of the SM Higgs quartic coupling and the quartic coupling for the elementary scalar, which leads to the vanshing of the latter quartic coupling and its beta function at the Planck scale.

1709.07608,hep-ph,"The reasons behind the gauge symmetry of the Standard Model, U(1)xSU(2)xSU(3), are still unsettled. One obvious feature is the low dimensionality of all its subgroups. Under certain conditions, a negative answer to the question ""why not larger groups like SU(15), or for that matter, SP(26) or E7?"" is possible.   We have recently observed that fermions charged under large groups acquire much bigger dynamical masses, all things being equal at a high e.g. GUT scale, than ordinary quarks. Should such multicharged fermions exist, they are just too heavy to be observed today (and have either decayed early on if coupled to the rest of the Standard Model, or become reliquial dark matter if uncoupled). Their mass scale is dictated by strong antiscreening of the running coupling for those larger groups (with an appropriately small number of flavors) together with scaling properties of the Dyson-Schwinger equation for the fermion mass.   The generated fermion mass (assuming only few flavors, to avoid spoiling antiscreening) grows exponentially with the number of colors as M(Nc) ~ exp(Nc) for scales much below the GUT scale.

In the numerics the dependence of the gluino decay widths on the QFV parameters is discussed with special emphasis put on the separation of the electroweak and the SUSY QCD corrections. The main dependence stems from the equation mixing in the decays to up-type squarks because there hold strong constraints from B-physics on the other quark-flavour mixing parameters. Including the full one-loop corrections, the changes of the gluino decay widths are mostly negative and of the order of about -10%. The QFV part stays small in the total width but can vary up to -8% for the decay width into the lightest squark.

1710.11452,hep-ph,"Building on the open-loop algorithm we introduce a new method for the automated construction of one-loop amplitudes and their reduction to scalar integrals. The key idea is that the factorisation of one-loop integrands in a product of loop segments makes it possible to perform various operations on-the-fly while constructing the integrand. Reducing the integrand on-the-fly, after each segment multiplication, the construction of loop diagrams and their reduction are unified in a single numerical recursion. In this way we entirely avoid objects with high tensor rank, thereby reducing the complexity of the calculations in a drastic way. Thanks to the on-the-fly approach, which is applied also to helicity summation and for the merging of different diagrams, the speed of the original open-loop algorithm can be further augmented in a very significant way. Moreover, addressing spurious singularities of the employed reduction identities by means of simple expansions in rank-two Gram determinants, we achieve a remarkably high level of numerical stability. These features of the new algorithm, which will be made publicly available in a forthcoming release of the OpenLoops program, are particularly attractive for NLO multi-leg and NNLO real-virtual calculations.",17,[],2

Interestingly, such a setup naturally leads to non-zero equation due to the existence of anti-symmetric contraction of the product of two triplet representations of equation. Such antisymmetric part of triplet products usually vanish for right handed neutrino Majorana mass terms, leading to equation symmetric scenarios in the most economical setups. We constrain the model parameters from the requirement of producing the correct neutrino data as well as baryon asymmetry of the Universe for right handed neutrino mass scale around TeV. The equation symmetry is augmented by additional equation symmetry to make sure that the splitting between right handed neutrinos required for resonant leptogenesis is generated only by next to leading order terms, making it naturally small.

Based on the mass of the equation, the existence of a doubly heavy bottom equation tetraquark that is stable to the strong and electromagnetic decays has been predicted. If the mass of this state is below 10405 MeV, as predicted in some models, we argue using heavy quark-diquark symmetry that the equation equation doubly bottom tetraquark state will lie just below the open bottom threshold and likely be a narrow state as well. In this scenario, we compute strong decay width for this state using a new Lagrangian for tetraquarks which is related to the singly heavy baryon Lagrangian by heavy quark-diquark symmetry.",17,[],2

1707.04841,hep-ph,"Nonlinear Compton scattering (NCS) and nonlinear Breit-Wheeler (NBW) process are strongly multi-photon and highly nonlinear processes. In ultra intense lasers (normalized field amplitude equation), radiation formation length is much shorter than a period and single NCS/NBW cannot be described as scatterings of electrons dressing plane waves with equation photons for what they feel is a local constant crossed field. However, present theories in constant crossed fields are hard to give some important quantum features due to divergence problems, such as number of laser photons involved, instantaneous angular distribution and detailed spectrum. As an alternative, present understanding of single NCS/NBW in ultra intense lasers includes several classical and semi-quantum ideas such as forward emission, recoil reaction and spectrum cutoff. We investigated multi-photon effects on NCS/NBW in ultra intense lasers by extracting the number of laser photons involved in a single process in ultra intense lasers from formulae of existing theories. New features of single NCS in ultra intense lasers including fixed emission angle to instantaneous electron momentum, instantaneous deflection of electron, and disappearance of spectrum cutoff are deduced. Similar features of single NBW in ultra intense lasers including non-vanishing emission angles to instantaneous equation photon momentum, disappearance of spectrum cutoff and appearance of spectrum lower limit are also obtained.

1711.10851,hep-ph,"Bound states are stationary in time and interact continuously. Even a first approximation of atomic wave functions in QED requires contributions of all orders in \alpha. Bound state perturbation theory depends on the choice of this first approximation, just as the Taylor expansion of an ordinary function depends on the expansion point. Considering the expansion to be not in equation but in equation, i.e., in the number of loops, defines the perturbative expansion uniquely also for bound states. I show how the Schrodinger equation for Positronium with the classical potential equation corresponds to the Born, equation bound state approximation in QED.   Standard perturbation theory is based on an expansion around equation free states that have no overlap with bound states. Perturbing around bound states requires using interacting equation and equation states. For Born states the binding potential arises from a classical gauge field. In the absence of loops the QCD scale equation can originate from a boundary condition imposed on the solution of the classical gluon field equations. A perturbative expansion may be relevant even for hadrons, if their non-perturbative features such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are present already in the Born term.",17,[],2

We find that scalar and pseudoscalar operators do not contribute to the branching ratio of equation. We perform a global fit to all relevant equation data for different new physics scenarios. For each of these scenarios, we predict equation. We find that a significant enhancement in equation is not allowed by any of these new physics operators.

This enables us to predict the equation asymmetry equation in equation. While the predicted central values of equation are outside the physically allowed region, they are currently associated with large uncertainties owing to the large errors in the measurements of the equation branching ratio (equation), the other equation asymmetries equation (of equation) and equation (of equation). With a precise determination of equation, equation and equation, one can use our analytical result to predict equation with a reduced error and compare it with the experimental measurement when it becomes available.

This implies that in the Euclidean framework, there is no systematic expansion in powers of equation for such processes. Such considerations also carry over directly to no-boundary scenarios involving Hawking-Turok instantons. In this note, we illustrate this failure of decoupling in the Euclidean approach with a simple model of axion monodromy and then argue that the situation can be remedied with a Lorentzian prescription such as the Picard-Lefschetz theory.

This resembles the structure of the global symmetry groups of the holographically dual SCFTs, where equation is interpreted as the R-symmetry and equation as the flavor symmetry. Moreover, we discuss possible supersymmetry preserving continuous deformations, which correspond to the conformal manifolds of the dual SCFTs. Under the assumption that the scalar manifold of the supergravity is a symmetric space we derive general group theoretical conditions on these moduli. Using these results we determine the AdS solutions of all gauged supergravities with more than 16 real supercharges.

The four-string scattering amplitudes with three tachyons and an arbitrary string state are calculated. The string field theory yields the string scattering amplitudes evaluated on the world sheet of string scattering whereas the coventional method, based on the first quantized theory brings us the string scattering amplitudes defined on the upper half plane. For the highest spin states, generated by the primary operators, both calculations are in perfect agreement. In this case, the string scattering amplitudes are invariant under the conformal transformation, which maps the string world sheet onto the upper half plane. If the external string states are general massive states, generated by non-primary field operators, we need to take into account carefully the conformal transformation between the world sheet and the upper half plane.

1706.09080,hep-th,"Asymptotic symmetries of AdSequation quantum gravity and gauge theory are derived by coupling the dual CFTequation to Chern-Simons gauge theory and 3D gravity in a ""probe"" large-level limit. The infinite-dimensional symmetries are shown to arise when one is restricted to boundary subspaces with effectively two-dimensional geometry. A canonical example of such a restriction occurs within the 4D subregion described by a Wheeler-DeWitt wavefunctional of AdSequation quantum gravity. An AdSequation analog of Minkowski ""super-rotation"" asymptotic symmetry is probed by 3D Einstein gravity, yielding CFTequation structure, via AdSequation foliation of AdSequation and the AdSequation/CFTequation correspondence. The maximal asymptotic symmetry is however probed by 3D conformal gravity. Both 3D gravities have Chern-Simons formulation, manifesting their topological character. Chern-Simons structure is also shown to be emergent in the Poincare patch of AdSequation, as soft/boundary limits of 4D gauge theory, rather than ""put in by hand"", with a finite effective Chern-Simons level. Several of the considerations of asymptotic symmetry structure are found to be simpler for AdSequation than for Minkequation, such as non-zero 4D particle masses, 4D non-perturbative ""hard"" effects, and consistency with unitarity. The last of these, in particular, is greatly simplified, because in some set-ups the time dimension is explicitly shared by each level of description: Lorentzian AdSequation, CFTequation and CFTequation. The CFTequation structure clarifies the sense in which the infinite asymptotic charges constitute a useful form of ""hair"" for black holes and other complex 4D states.

When the bulk is not globally AdSequation the appearance of non-minimal geodesics leads to ambiguities in these definitions. In this work conical defect spacetimes are considered as an example where non-minimal geodesics are common. From the bulk it is found that the conical defect kinematic space can be obtained from the AdSequation kinematic space by the same quotient under which one obtains the defect from AdSequation.

We calculate leading contribution to the one-loop effective action using the on-shell background superfields corresponding to the option when gauge group equation is broken to equation. In the bosonic sector the effective action involves the structure equation, where equation is a monomial of the fourth degree in an abelian field strength equation and equation stands for the scalar fields from the equation-hypermultiplet.

This is the reason why I decided to offer a revised version.   Original abstract: This is the eighth paper in the series devoted to the systematic study of effective theories. Below, I discuss the renormalization of the one-loop two-leg functions in multicomponent effective scalar theory. It is shown that only a part of numerous contributions that appear in the general expression for a two-leg graph can be considered as the true self-energy function. This part is completely fixed by the values of minimal coupling constants; it is the only one that should be taken into account in the conventional process of the summation of Dyson's chain that results in explicit expression for the full propagator. The other parts provide the well-defined finite corrections for the graphs with the number of legs n > 2. It is also shown that there is no need to attract the renormalization prescriptions for the higher derivatives of the two-leg function on the mass shell; the requirements of finiteness and diagonability turn out to be quite sufficient.",17,[],4
1705.02318,hep-th,"Motivated by AdS/CFT, we address the following outstanding question in large equation conformal field theory: given the appearance of a single-trace operator in the equation OPE of a scalar primary equation, what is its total contribution to the vacuum four-point function equation as dictated by crossing symmetry? We solve this problem in 4d conformal field theories at leading order in equation. Viewed holographically, this provides a field theory reconstruction of crossing-symmetric, four-point exchange amplitudes in AdSequation. Our solution takes the form of a resummation of the large spin solution to the crossing equations, supplemented by corrections at finite spin, required by crossing. The method can be applied to the exchange of operators of arbitrary twist equation and spin equation, although it vastly simplifies for even-integer twist, where we give explicit results. The output is the set of OPE data for the exchange of all double-trace operators equation. We find that the double-trace anomalous dimensions equation are negative, monotonic and convex functions of equation, for all equation and all equation. This constitutes a holographic signature of bulk causality and classical dynamics of even-spin fields. We also find that the ""derivative relation"" between double-trace anomalous dimensions and OPE coefficients does not hold in general, and derive the explicit form of the deviation in several cases.

We provide an equation that systematically describes the stable degeneration of a K3 surface into a pair of isomorphic rational elliptic surfaces. When two rational elliptic surfaces have different complex structures, whether their sum glued along a smooth fiber admits deformation to a K3 surface can be determined by studying the structure of the K3 lattice. We investigate the lattice theoretic condition to determine whether a deformation to a K3 surface exists for pairs of extremal rational elliptic surfaces.

The sum of two isomorphic rational elliptic surfaces glued together admits a deformation to a K3 surface, the singular fibers of which are twice that of the rational elliptic surface. For special situations, singular fibers of the resulting K3 surface collide and they are enhanced to a fiber of another type. Some K3 surfaces become attractive in these situations.

1704.03739,hep-th,"In the present note we show that the recently established connections between soft theorems, large gauge transformations and memories are persistant in the infrared safe formulation of quantum field theory. They take a different and simplified form and can all be derived from the non-trivial asymptotic dynamics that is proper to any theory with massless fields. Several results in this paper had already been presented in one form or another with varying interpretations. The new parts here are an improved derivation of charges for large gauge transformations in the framework of non-trivial asymptotic dynamics, the connection to the classical memory effect and an overall more unified and accessible treatment of the topic. Since the formulation of QFT without infrared divergences is physically more appealing, the infrared safe version of the above connections should be so as well.",17,[],4

If two such minimal surfaces intersect at a point in the bulk then CFT operators which commute with both extended modular Hamiltonians must be localized at the intersection point. We use this to construct local bulk operators purely from CFT considerations, without knowing the bulk metric, using intersecting modular Hamiltonians. For conformal field theories at zero and finite temperature the appropriate modular Hamiltonians are known explicitly and we recover known expressions for local bulk observables.",17,[],4

1712.09101,hep-th,"The duality between a equation-dimensional conformal field theory with relevant deformation and a gravity theory on an asymptotically AdSequation geometry, has become a suitable tool in the investigation of the emergence of gravity from quantum entanglement in field theory. Recently, we have tested the duality between the mass-deformed ABJM theory and asymptotically AdSequation gravity theory, which is obtained from the KK reduction of the 11-dimensional supergravity on the LLM geometry. In this paper, we extend the KK reduction procedure beyond the linear order and establish non-trivial KK maps between 4-dimensional fields and 11-dimensional fluctuations. We rely on this gauge/gravity duality to calculate the entanglement entropy by using the Ryu-Takayanagi holographic formula and the path integral method developed by Faulkner. We show that the entanglement entropies obtained using these two methods agree when the asymptotically AdSequation metric satisfies the linearized Einstein equation with nonvanishing energy-momentum tensor for two scalar fields. These scalar fields encode the information of the relevant deformation of the ABJM theory. This confirms that the asymptotic limit of LLM geometry is the emergent gravity of the quantum entanglement in the mass-deformed ABJM theory with a small mass parameter.

Under the assumption that there is adjustable generation or load at every bus in the power transmission network, we develop a technique to approximate RAC-OPF from within by a finite-dimensional semidefinite program by restricting the space of recourse policies to be affine in the uncertain problem data. We establish a sufficient condition under which the semidefinite program returns an affine recourse policy that is guaranteed to be feasible for the original RAC-OPF problem.

We show that over finite dimensional algebras, representations with finitely many orbits, or finitely many invariant subspaces, or distributive coincide, and further coincide with thin modules in the acyclic case. Incidence algebras produce examples of such modules, and we show that algebras which are locally hereditary, and whose projective are distributive, or equivalently, which have finitely many ideals, are precisely the deformations of incidence algebras, and they are the finite dimensional algebra analogue of Prequationfer rings. New characterizations of incidence algebras are obtained, such as they are exactly algebras which have a faithful thin module. A main consequence is that ""every thin module comes from an incidence algebra"": if equation is either a thin module over a finite dimensional algebra equation, or equation is distributive and equation is acyclic, then equation is an incidence algebra and equation can be presented as its defining representation. We classify thin/distributive modules, and respectively deformations, of incidence algebras in terms of first and second cohomology of the simplicial realization of the poset. As a main application we obtain a complete classification of thin modules over any finite dimensional algebra. Their moduli spaces are multilinear varieties, and we show that any multilinear variety can be obtained in this way. A few other applications, to Grothendieck rings of combinatorial algebras, to graphs and their incidence matrices, to linear algebra (tori actions on matrices), and to a positive answer to the ""no-gap conjecture"" of Ringel and Bongartz, in the distributive case, are given.

1710.05180,math,"In this paper, we first establish a kind of weighted space-time equation estimate, which belongs to Keel-Smith-Sogge type estimates, for perturbed linear elastic wave equations. This estimate refines the corresponding one established by the second author [J. Differential Equations 263(2017), 1947--1965] and is proved by combining the methods in the former paper, the first author, Wang and Yokoyama's paper   [Adv. Differential Equations 17 (2012), 267--306], and some new ingredients. Then together with some weighted Sobolev inequalities, this estimate is used to show a refined version of almost global existence of classical solutions for nonlinear elastic waves with small initial data. Compared with former almost global existence results for nonlinear elastic waves due to John [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 41 (1988) 615--666], Klaierman-Sideris [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 49 (1996) 307--321], the main innovation of our one is that it considerably improves the amount of regularity of initial data, i.e., the Sobolev regularity of initial data is assumed to be the smallest among all the admissible Sobolev spaces of integer order in the standard local existence theory. Finally, in the radially symmetric case, we establish the almost global existence of a low regularity solution for every small initial data in equation.",17,[],0
1709.06985,math,"We present a derivative-based algorithm for nonlinearly constrained optimization problems that is tolerant of inaccuracies in the data. The algorithm solves a semi-smooth set of nonlinear equations that are equivalent to the first-order optimality conditions, and it is matrix-free in the sense that it does not require the explicit Lagrangian Hessian or Jacobian of the constraints. The solution method is quasi-Newton, but rather than approximating only the Hessian or constraint Jacobian, the Jacobian of the entire nonlinear set of equations is approximated using a multisecant method. We show how preconditioning can be incorporated into the multisecant update in order to improve the performance of the method. For nonconvex problems, we propose a simple modification of the secant conditions to regularize the Hessian. Numerical experiments suggest that the algorithm is a promising alternative to conventional gradient-based algorithms, particularly when errors are present in the data.",17,[],0

1706.06456,math,"The flip-graph of a convex polygon equation is the graph whose vertices are the triangulations of equation and whose edges correspond to flips between them. The eccentricity of a triangulation equation of equation is the largest possible distance in this graph from equation to any triangulation of equation. It is well known that, when all equation interior edges of equation are incident to the same vertex, the eccentricity of equation in the flip-graph of equation is exactly equation, where equation denotes the number of vertices of equation. Here, this statement is generalized to arbitrary triangulations. Denoting by equation the largest number of interior edges of equation incident to a vertex, it is shown that the eccentricity of equation in the flip-graph of equation is exactly equation, provided equation. Inversely, the eccentricity of a triangulation, when small enough, allows to recover the value of equation. More precisely, if equation, it is also shown that equation has eccentricity equation if and only if exactly equation of its interior edges are incident to a given vertex. When equation, bounds on the eccentricity of equation are also given and discussed.",17,[],0
1705.09593,math,"In the present paper, we treat random matrix products on the general linear group equation, where equation is a vector space defined on any local field, when the top Lyapunov exponent is simple, without irreducibility assumption. In particular, we show the existence and uniqueness of the stationary measure equation on equation that is relative to the top Lyapunov exponent and we describe the projective subspace generated by its support. We observe that the dynamics takes place in a open set of equation which has the structure of a skew product space. Then, we relate this support to the limit set of the semi-group equation of equation generated by the random walk. Moreover, we show that equation has Holder regularity and give some limit theorems concerning the behavior of the random walk and the probability of hitting a hyperplane. These results generalize known ones when equation acts strongly irreducibly and proximally (i-p to abbreviate) on equation. In particular, when applied to the affine group in the so-called contracting case or more generally when the Zariski closure of equation is not necessarily reductive, the Holder regularity of the stationary measure together with the description of the limit set are new.

The cost functions of different agents are coupled through a mean-field term that depends on the mean of the population states. We show that although the mean-field game is not a potential game, under some mild condition the equation-Nash equilibrium of the mean-field game coincides with the optimal solution to a social welfare optimization problem, and this is true even when the individual cost functions are non-convex. The connection enables us to evaluate and promote the efficiency of the mean-field equilibrium. In addition, it also leads to several important implications on the existence, uniqueness, and computation of the mean-field equilibrium.

Several authors have proposed randomization and stochastic programming techniques to drastically reduce the number of system solves by estimating the objective function using only a few appropriately chosen random linear combinations of the sources. While some have reported good solution quality at a greatly reduced cost, for our problem of interest, diffuse optical tomography, the approach often does not lead to sufficiently accurate solutions.

Second, after solving to a modest tolerance, we compute a few simultaneous sources and detectors that maximize the Frobenius norm of the sampled Jacobian to improve the rate of convergence and obtain more accurate solutions. We complement these optimized simultaneous sources and detectors by random simultaneous sources and detectors constrained to a complementary subspace.

We consider two types of switching, one where the coupling function changes periodically and one where it changes probabilistically. We find, through bifurcation diagrams and Basin Stability analysis, that there exists a window in coupling strength where the oscillations get suppressed. Beyond this window, the oscillations are revived again. A similar trend emerges with respect to the relative predominance of the coupling forms, with the largest window of fixed point dynamics arising where there is balance in the probability of occurrence of the coupling forms. Further, significantly, more rapid switching of coupling forms yields large regions of oscillation suppression. Lastly, we propose an effective model for the dynamics arising from switched coupling forms and demonstrate how this model captures the basic features observed in numerical simulations and also offers an accurate estimate of the fixed point region through linear stability analysis.",17,[],9

In a recent study of such KG particle chains with quartic (4th order) anharmonicity in the on-site potential, it was shown that equationGaussian probability distribution functions of sums of position observables with equation always approach pure Gaussians (equation) in the long time limit and hence the motion of the full system is ultimately ""strongly chaotic"". In the present paper, we show that these results continue to hold even when a sextic (6th order) term is gradually added to the potential and ultimately prevails over the 4th order anharmonicity, despite expectations that the dynamics is more ""regular"", at least in the regime of small oscillations.

1707.00162,nlin,"We revisit the mechanisms underlying the process of spectral broadening of incoherent optical waves propagating in nonlinear media on the basis of nonequilibrium thermodynamic considerations. A simple analysis reveals that a prerequisite for the existence of a significant spectral broadening of the waves is that the linear part of the energy (Hamiltonian) has different contributions of opposite signs. It turns out that, at variance with the expected soliton turbulence scenario, an increase of the amount of disorder (incoherence) in the system does not require the generation of a coherent soliton structure. We illustrate the idea by considering the propagation of two wave components in an optical fiber with opposite dispersion coefficients. A wave turbulence approach of the problem reveals that the increase of kinetic energy in one component is offset by the negative reduction in the other component, so that the waves exhibit, as a general rule, a virtually unlimited spectral broadening. More precisely, a self-similar solution of the kinetic equations reveals that the spectra of the incoherent waves tend to relax toward a homogeneous distribution in the wake of a front that propagates in frequency space with a decelerating velocity. We discuss this catastrophic process of spectral broadening in the light of different important phenomena, in particular supercontinuum generation, soliton turbulence, wave condensation, and the runaway motion of mechanical systems composed of positive and negative masses.",17,[],9

The locking of the second pump, through adiabatic tuning of its frequency, to the comb generated by the first pump allows transitioning to single-soliton states, manipulating the position of Kerr solitons in the cavity, and tuning the frequency comb repetition rate within the locking range. It also explains soliton crystal formation in resonators supporting a dispersive wave emitted as a result of higher-order group velocity dispersion or avoided mode crossing. We show that dichromatic pumping by externally stabilized pumps can be utilized for stabilization of microresonator-based optical frequency combs when the comb span does not cover an octave or a significant fraction thereof and standard self-referencing techniques cannot be employed.

1704.06079,nlin,"Maintaining the synchronous motion of dynamical systems interacting on complex networks is often critical to their functionality. However, real-world networked dynamical systems operating synchronously are prone to random perturbations driving the system to arbitrary states within the corresponding basin of attraction, thereby leading to epochs of desynchronized dynamics with a priori unknown durations. Thus, it is highly relevant to have an estimate of the duration of such transient phases before the system returns to synchrony, following a random perturbation to the dynamical state of any particular node of the network. We address this issue here by proposing the framework of \emphsingle-node recovery time (SNRT) which provides an estimate of the relative time scales underlying the transient dynamics of the nodes of a network during its restoration to synchrony. We utilize this in differentiating the particularly \emphslow nodes of the network from the relatively \emphfast nodes, thus identifying the critical nodes which when perturbed lead to significantly enlarged recovery time of the system before resuming synchronized operation. Further, we reveal explicit relationships between the SNRT values of a network, and its \emphglobal relaxation time when starting all the nodes from random initial conditions. We employ the proposed concept for deducing microscopic relationships between topological features of nodes and their respective SNRT values. The framework of SNRT is further extended to a measure of resilience of the different nodes of a networked dynamical system.

The gain level has only a minor influence on the threshold but controls mainly the power of the solitons. At large initial detuning and high threshold gain, the first observed structure can be a high order soliton. In real devices spatial disorder in the cavity length causes a pinning of solitons and a dispersion of thresholds. The experimental observations are in good agreement with numerical simulations taking into account disorder and the coupling of gain and cavity resonance due to Joule heating.

Here the elements have rhythmic state variables whose mutual influence promotes temporal order. A parallel form of order is seen in swarming systems, such as schools of fish or flocks of birds. Now the degrees of freedom are the individuals' positions, which get redistributed through interactions to form spatial structures. Systems capable of both swarming and synchronizing, dubbed swarmalators, have recently been proposed [O'Keeffe, Kevin P., and Steven H. Strogatz. ""Swarmalators: Oscillators that sync and swarm."" arXiv preprint arXiv:1701.05670 (2017)] and analyzed in the continuum limit. Here we extend this work by studying finite populations of swarmalators, whose phase similarity affects both their spatial attraction and repulsion. We find ring states, and compute criteria for their existence and stability. Larger populations can form annular distributions, whose density and inner and outer radii we calculate explicitly. These states may be observable in groups of Japanese tree frogs, magnetic colloids, and other systems with an interplay between swarming and synchronization.",17,[],9
1707.01257,nlin,"A general form of equation-dark soliton solutions of the multi-component Mel'nikov system is presented. Taking the coupled Mel'nikov system comprised of two-component short waves and one-component long wave as an example, its general equation-dark-dark soliton solutions in Gram determinant form are constructed through the KP hierarchy reduction method. The dynamics of single dark-dark soliton and two dark-dark solitons are discussed in detail. It can be shown that the collisions of dark-dark solitons are elastic and energies of the solitons in different components completely transmit through. In addition, the dark-dark soliton bound states including both stationary and moving cases are also investigated. An interesting feature for the coupled Mel'nikov system is that the stationary dark-dark soliton bound states can exist for all possible combinations of nonlinearity coefficients including all-positive, all-negative and mixed types, while the moving case are possible when they take opposite signs or they are both negative. The dynamics and several interesting structures of the solutions are illustrated through some figures.",17,[],9

Our model of choice will be the so-called Salerno model, which interpolates between the AL and the DNLS models. We find that rogue wave events essentially are drastically distorted even for very slight perturbations of the homotopic parameter connecting the two models off of the integrable limit.

1706.02530,nlin,"In a reaction-diffusion-advection system, with a convectively unstable regime, a perturbation creates a wave train that is advected downstream and eventually leaves the system. We show that the convective instability coexists with a local absolute instability when a fixed boundary condition upstream is imposed. This boundary induced instability acts as a continuous wave source, creating a local periodic excitation near the boundary, which initiates waves traveling both up and downstream. To confirm this, we performed analytical analysis and numerical simulations of a modified Martiel-Goldbeter reaction-diffusion model with the addition of an advection term. We provide a quantitative description of the wave packet appearing in the convectively unstable regime, which we found to be in excellent agreement with the numerical simulations. We characterize this new instability and show that in the limit of high advection speed, it is suppressed. This type of instability can be expected for reaction-diffusion systems that present both a convective instability and an excitable regime. In particular, it can be relevant to understand the signaling mechanism of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum that may experience fluid flows in its natural habitat.",17,[],9

In most of the work, the basic coupling arrangement is considered to be static over time, although many realistic systems exhibit significant changes in the interaction pattern as time varies. In this article, we study the emergence of amplitude death in a dynamical network composed of time-varying interaction amidst a collection of random walkers in a finite region of three dimensional space. We consider an oscillator for each walker and demonstrate that depending upon the network parameters and hence the interaction between them, global oscillation in the network gets suppressed. In this framework, vision range of each oscillator decides the number of oscillators with which it interacts. In addition, with the use of an appropriate feedback parameter in the coupling strategy, we articulate how the suppressed oscillation can be resurrected in the systems' parameter space. The phenomenon of amplitude death and the resurgence of oscillation is investigated taking limit cycle and chaotic oscillators for broad ranges of parameters, like interaction strength k between the entities, vision range r and the speed of movement v.",17,[],9

This model is used to describe the analytical form and the dynamics of dark solitons.

Using numerical simulations we show that these invariant manifolds temporarily repel nearby trajectories but act as global attractors.

We discuss the role of this rate of rotation on the transitions between the stable and unstable regimes.,17,[],9

1705.02619,nlin,"Bound states, also called soliton molecules, can form as a result of the interaction between individual solitons. This interaction is mediated through the tails of each soliton that overlap with one another. When such soliton tails have spatial oscillations, locking or pinning between two solitons can occur at fixed distances related with the wavelength of these oscillations, thus forming a bound state. In this work, we study the formation and stability of various types of bound states in the Lugiato-Lefever equation by computing their interaction potential and by analyzing the properties of the oscillatory tails. Moreover, we study the effect of higher order dispersion and noise in the pump intensity on the dynamics of bound states. In doing so, we reveal that perturbations to the Lugiato-Lefever equation that maintain reversibility, such as fourth order dispersion, lead to bound states that tend to separate from one another in time when noise is added. This separation force is determined by the shape of the envelope of the interaction potential, as well as an additional Brownian ratchet effect. In systems with broken reversibility, such as third order dispersion, this ratchet effect continues to push solitons within a bound state apart. However, the force generated by the envelope of the potential is now such that it pushes the solitons towards each other, leading to a null net drift of the solitons.",17,[],9
1712.00921,nlin,"A complex collective emerging behavior characterized by coexisting coherent and incoherent do- mains is termed as a chimera state. We bring out the existence of a new type of chimera in a nonlocally coupled ensemble of identical oscillators driven by a common dynamic environment. The latter facilitates the onset of phase-flip bifurcation/transitions among the coupled oscillators of the ensemble, while the nonlocal coupling induces a partial asynchronization among the out-of-phase synchronized oscillators at this onset. This leads to the manifestation of coexisting out-of-phase synchronized coherent domains interspersed by asynchronous incoherent domains elucidating the existence of a different type of chimera state. In addition to this, a rich variety of other collective behaviors such as clusters with phase-flip transition, conventional chimera, solitary state and com- plete synchronized state which have been reported using different coupling architectures are found to be induced by the employed couplings for appropriate coupling strengths.

1707.08082,nlin,"Critical transitions occur in a variety of dynamical systems. Here, we employ quantifiers of chaos to identify changes in the dynamical structure of complex systems preceding critical transitions. As suitable indicator variables for critical transitions, we consider changes in growth rates and directions of covariant Lyapunov vectors. Studying critical transitions in several models of fast-slow systems, i.e., a network of coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators, models for Josephson junctions and the Hindmarsh-Rose model, we find that tangencies between covariant Lyapunov vectors are a common and maybe generic feature during critical transitions. We further demonstrate that this deviation from hyperbolic dynamics is linked to the occurrence of critical transitions by using it as an indicator variable and evaluating the prediction success through receiver operating characteristic curves. In the presence of noise, we find the alignment of covariant Lyapunov vectors and changes in finite-time Lyapunov exponents to be more successful in announcing critical transitions than common indicator variables as, e.g., finite-time estimates of the variance. Additionally, we propose a new method for estimating approximations of covariant Lyapunov vectors without knowledge of the future trajectory of the system. We find that these approximated covariant Lyapunov vectors can also be applied to predict critical transitions.",17,[],9

1707.01695,nlin,"In this report, we investigate the stabilization of saddle fixed points in coupled oscillators where individual oscillators exhibit the saddle fixed points. The coupled oscillators may have two structurally different types of suppressed states, namely amplitude death and oscillation death. The stabilization of saddle equilibrium point refers to the amplitude death state where oscillations are ceased and all the oscillators converge to the single stable steady state via inverse pitchfork bifurcation. Due to multistability features of oscillation death states, linear stability theory fails to analyze the stability of such states analytically, so we quantify all the states by basin stability measurement which is an universal nonlocal nonlinear concept and it interplays with the volume of basins of attractions. We also observe multi-clustered oscillation death states in a random network and measure them using basin stability framework. To explore such phenomena we choose a network of coupled Duffing-Holmes and Lorenz oscillators which are interacting through mean-field coupling. We investigate how basin stability for different steady states depends on mean-field density and coupling strength.

The resultant backward Neumann type systems are proved to be completely integrable in the Liouville sense via a Lax equation.

1703.09030,nlin,"The search for symmetry as an unusual yet profoundly appealing phenomenon, and the origin of regular, repeating configuration patterns have long been a central focus of complexity science and physics. To better grasp and understand symmetry of configurations in decentralized toroidal architectures, we employ group-theoretic methods, which allow us to identify and enumerate these inputs, and argue about irreversible system behaviors with undesired effects on many computational problems. The concept of so-called configuration shift-symmetry is applied to two-dimensional cellular automata as an ideal model of computation. Regardless of the transition function, the results show the universal insolvability of crucial distributed tasks, such as leader election, pattern recognition, hashing, and encryption. By using compact enumeration formulas and bounding the number of shift-symmetric configurations for a given lattice size, we efficiently calculate the probability of a configuration being shift-symmetric for a uniform or density-uniform distribution. Further, we devise an algorithm detecting the presence of shift-symmetry in a configuration.   Given the resource constraints, the enumeration and probability formulas can directly help to lower the minimal expected error and provide recommendations for system's size and initialization.

Through phase reduction theory, we can systematically simplify the nonlinear multi-dimensional differential equations describing a limit-cycle oscillator to a one-dimensional phase equation, which is much easier to analyze. Classical applications of this theory, i.e., the phase locking of an oscillator to a periodic external forcing and the mutual synchronization of interacting oscillators, are explained.

This discrete ambiguity is also known as the Omelaenko-Gersten-type ambiguity. In this paper, we show that for scalar particles, discrete ambiguities are just a subset of continuum ambiguities with a specific phase and thus mix partial waves, as the continuum ambiguity does.

These additional excitations are introduced as a perturbation to the underlying axially-symmetric rigid rotor structure of the ground state rotational band. Coupling matrix elements of the generalized optical model are derived for extended multi-band transitions in even-even and odd-equation nuclei. Isospin symmetric formulation of the optical model is employed.   A coupled-channels optical model potential (OMP) containing a dispersive contribution is used to fit simultaneously all available optical experimental databases including neutron strength functions for nucleon scattering on equationTh, equationU and equationPu nuclei and quasi-elastic (equation,equation) scattering data on equationTh and equationU. Lane consistent OMP is derived for all actinides if corresponding multi-band coupling schemes are defined. Calculations using the derived OMP potential reproduce measured total cross-section differences between several actinide pairs within experimental uncertainty for incident neutron energies from 50 keV up to 150MeV. Multi-band coupling is stronger in even-even targets due to the collective nature of the coupling; the impact of extended coupling on predicted compound-nucleus formation cross section reaches 5% below 3 MeV of incident neutron energy.

In particular, the low-energy excitations, with a spectrum linear in momentum, can play a major role in the emission and propagation of neutrinos. In this paper, we focus on the elementary modes in the region of proton superfluidity, where the neutron component is expected to have a very small or zero pairing gap.   We study the overall spectral functions of protons, neutrons and electrons on the basis of the Coulomb and nuclear interactions. This study is performed in the framework of the Random Phase Approximation, generalized in order to describe the response of a superfluid system. The formalism we use ensures that the Generalized Ward's Identities are satisfied. Despite their relative small fraction, the protons turn out to modify the neutron spectral function as a consequence of the nuclear neutron-proton interaction. This effect is particularly evident at the lower density, just below the crust for a density close to the saturation value, while at increasing density the neutrons and the protons are mainly decoupled. The proton spectral function is characterized by a pseudo-Goldstone mode below equation, twice the pairing gap, and a pair-breaking mode above equation. The latter merges in the sound mode of the normal phase at higher momenta. The neutron spectral function develops a collective sound mode only at the higher density.

1701.09105,nucl-th,"We analyze the phenomenon of size-flow transmutation in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions in a model where the initial size fluctuations are driven by the wounded quarks and the collectivity is provided by viscous hydrodynamics. It is found that the model properly reproduces the data for the transverse momentum fluctuations measured for PbPb collisions at 2.76TeV by the ALICE Collaboration. The agreement holds for a remarkably wide range of centralities, from 0-5% up to 70-80%, and displays a departure from a simple scaling with equation in the form seen in the data. The overall agreement in the model with wounded quarks is significantly better than with nucleon participants. This feature joins the previously-found wounded quark multiplicity scaling in the argumentation in favor of subnucleonic degrees of freedom in the early dynamics.

The reminder is due to the details in the symmetry energy at subnormal densities and its impact on proton and neutron distributions in the initial state.

1710.00626,nucl-th,"A one-dimensional system of bosons interacting with contact and single-Gaussian forces is studied with an expansion in hyperspherical harmonics. The hyperradial potentials are calculated using the link between the hyperspherical harmonics and the single-particle harmonic-oscillator basis while the coupled hyperradial equations are solved with the Lagrange-mesh method. Extensions of this method are proposed to achieve good convergence with small numbers of mesh points for any truncation of hypermomentum. The convergence with hypermomentum strongly depends on the range of the two-body forces: it is very good for large ranges but deteriorates as the range decreases, being the worst for the contact interaction. In all cases, the lowest-order energy is within 4.5equation of the exact solution and shows the correct cubic asymptotic behaviour at large boson numbers. Details of the convergence studies are presented for 3, 5, 20 and 100 bosons. A special treatment for three bosons was found to be necessary.

They also affect single nucleon (equation) knockout reactions, yielding a one-particle one-hole (1p1h) final state. Both channels affect the inclusive strength.

Purpose: To present the new scheme and its microscopic motivation, and to test it using a Nilsson model calculation with the original shell model orbits and with the new proxy set. Method: We invoke an approximate, analytic, treatment of the Nilsson model, that allows the above vetting and yet is also transparent in understanding the approximations involved in the new proxy-SU(3). Results: It is found that the new scheme yields a Nilsson diagram for well-deformed nuclei that is very close to the original Nilsson diagram.

1712.07982,nucl-th,"In this contribution we report on theoretical studies of equation nuclear quasi-bound states in few- and many-body systems performed recently by the Jerusalem-Prague Collaboration [1-5]. Underlying energy-dependent equation interactions are derived from coupled-channel models that incorporate the equation resonance. The role of self-consistent treatment of the strong energy dependence of subthreshold equation amplitudes is discussed. Quite large downward energy shift together with rapid decrease of the equation amplitudes below threshold result in relatively small binding energies and widths of the calculated equation nuclear bound states. We argue that the subthreshold behavior of equation scattering amplitudes is crucial to conclude whether equation nuclear states exist, in which nuclei the equation meson could be bound and if the corresponding widths are small enough to allow detection of these equation nuclear states in experiment.",17,[],11
1705.11083,nucl-th,"The physical reason why one can calculate with similar accuracy, as compared to the experimental data, the absolute cross section associated with two-nucleon transfer processes between members of pairing rotational bands, making use of simple BCS (constant matrix elements) or of many-body (Nambu-Gorkov (NG), nuclear field theory (NFT)) spectroscopic amplitudes, is not immediately obvious. Restoration of spontaneous symmetry breaking and associated emergent generalised rigidity in gauge space provides the answer, and points to a new emergence: a physical sum rule resulting from the intertwining of structure and reaction processes and closely connected with the central role induced pairing interaction plays in structure together with the fact that successive transfer dominates Cooper pair tunnelling.",17,[],11

We study the emission process of alpha particles from an isolated quasi-bound state generated by an effective potential to a scattering state. The effective potential is expressed in terms of Frahn form of potential which is exactly solvable and an analytical expression for half-life is obtained in terms of Coulomb function, wave function and the potential. We then derive a closed form expression for the decay half-life in terms of the parameters of the potential, Q-value of the system, mass and proton numbers of the nuclei valid for alpha-decay as well as proton-decay. From the nature of variations of half-life as a function of radial distance, we trace the radial independence region where decay time is almost constant.

It is stressed that the model, which stems from the universal property of factorization exhibited by the nuclear wave function at short inter-nucleon distances, is only applicable in a well-defined region of krel and Kc.m.; it is shown, in particular, that the requirement of factorization introduces a severe constraint on the values of krel and Kc.m. that appear in the convolution integral. Using ab-initio relative and c.m. momentum distributions for 3He, the validity of the convolution model is investigated by comparing the model spectral function and momentum distributions with the ones resulting from ab-initio calculations performed with realistic local NN interaction of the Argonne family. It is shown that when the constraint on the value of krel and Kc.m. are correctly taken into account and only 2N SRC are taken into account, the convolution model is in good agreement with the ab-initio spectral function in the region of the peak exhibited by the latter, whereas far from the peak, particularly at high values of the removal energy, the model spectral function can be qualitatively reconciled with the ab-initio spectral function only by considering the effects of 3N SRC. As for the nucleon momentum distribution, the effects of 3N SRC appears to be very small.",17,[],11

Our results suggest that the ground-state of equationO has a threshold character, i.e., is very weakly bound or slightly unbound. We also predict narrow excited resonances in equationO and equationO.

1703.01715,nucl-th,"[Background] The hyperon impurity effect in nuclei has been extensively studied in different mean-field models. Recently, there is a controversy about whether the equation hyperon is more tightly bound in the normal deformed (ND) states than that in the superdeformed (SD) states.[Purpose] This article is aimed to provide a beyond-mean-field study of the low-lying states of hypernuclei with shape coexistence and to shed some light on the controversy.[Method] The models of relativistic mean-field and beyond based on a relativistic point-coupling energy functional are adopted to study the low-lying states of both equationAr and equationAr. The wavefunctions of low-lying states are constructed as a superposition of a set of relativistic mean-field states with different values of quadrupole deformation parameter. The projections onto both particle number and angular momentum are considered.[Results] The equation binding energies in both ND and SD states of equationAr are studied in the case of the equation hyperon occupying equation, or equation state in the spherical limit, respectively. For comparison, four sets of nucleon-hyperon point-coupling interactions are used respectively. Moreover, the spectra of low-lying states in equationAr and equationAr are calculated based on the same nuclear energy density functional. The results indicate that the SD states exist in equationAr for all the four effective interactions. Furthermore, the equation reduces the quadrupole collectivity of ND states to a greater extent than that of SD states. For equationAr, the beyond-mean-field decreases the equation binding energy of the SD state by 0.17 MeV, but it almost has no effect on that of the ND state.

1711.00369,nucl-th,"For the overlap matrix element between Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov states, there are two analytically different formulae: one with the square root of the determinant (the Onishi formula) and the other with the Pfaffian (Robledo's Pfaffian formula). The former formula is two-valued as a complex function, hence it leaves the sign of the norm overlap undetermined (i.e., the so-called sign problem of the Onishi formula). On the other hand, the latter formula does not suffer from the sign problem. The derivations for these two formulae are so different that the reasons are obscured why the resultant formulae possess different analytical properties. In this paper, we discuss the reason why the difference occurs by means of the consistent framework, which is based on the linked cluster theorem and the product-sum identity for the Pfaffian. Through this discussion, we elucidate the source of the sign problem in the Onishi formula. We also point out that different summation methods of series expansions may result in analytically different formulae.",17,[],11

Previous fluid dynamical calculations in Cartesian coordinates with an initial state based on a streak by streak Yang-Mills field led for peripheral higher energy collisions to large angular momentum, initial shear flow and significant local vorticity. Recent experiments verified the existence of this vorticity via the resulting polarization of emitted equation and equation particles. At the same time parton cascade models indicated the existence of more compact initial state configurations, which we are going to simulate in our approach.   The proposed model satisfies all the conservation laws including conservation of a strong initial angular momentum which is present in non-central collisions. As a consequence of this large initial angular momentum we observe the rotation of the whole system as well as the fluid shear in the initial state, which leads to large flow vorticity. Another advantage of the proposed model is that the initial state can be given in both [t,x,y,z] and equation coordinates, and thus can be tested by all 31D hydrodynamical codes which exist in the field.",17,[],11

Semiconductor nanoantennas are particularly practical for this purpose because simple geometries, such as wires and spheres, support multiple, degenerate optical resonances. Here, we start by modifying Mie scattering theory developed for plane wave illumination to describe scattering of dipole emission.

These charge tiles may be employed by large detectors, such as the proposed tonne-scale nEXO experiment to search for neutrinoless double-beta decay. Modular by design, an array of tiles can cover a sizable area. The width of each strip is small compared to the size of the tile, so a Frisch grid is not required. A grid-less, tiled anode design is beneficial for an experiment such as nEXO, where a wire tensioning support structure and Frisch grid might contribute radioactive backgrounds and would have to be designed to accommodate cycling to cryogenic temperatures. The segmented anode also reduces some degeneracies in signal reconstruction that arise in large-area crossed-wire time projection chambers.

1703.06230,physics,"The apparent dichotomy between quantum jumps on the one hand, and continuous time evolution according to wave equations on the other hand, provided a challenge to Bohr's proposal of quantum jumps in atoms. Furthermore, Schroedinger's time-dependent equation also seemed to require a modification of the explanation for the origin of line spectra due to the apparent possibility of superpositions of energy eigenstates for different energy levels. Indeed, Schroedinger himself proposed a quantum beat mechanism for the generation of discrete line spectra from superpositions of eigenstates with different energies.   However, these issues between old quantum theory and Schroedinger's wave mechanics were correctly resolved only after the development and full implementation of photon quantization. The second quantized scattering matrix formalism reconciles quantum jumps with continuous time evolution through the identification of quantum jumps with transitions between different sectors of Fock space. The continuous evolution of quantum states is then recognized as a sum over continually evolving jump amplitudes between different sectors in Fock space.   In today's terminology, this suggests that linear combinations of scattering matrix elements are epistemic sums over ontic states. Insights from the resolution of the dichotomy between quantum jumps and continuous time evolution therefore hold important lessons for modern research both on interpretations of quantum mechanics and on the foundations of quantum computing. They demonstrate that discussions of interpretations of quantum theory necessarily need to take into account field quantization. They also demonstrate the limitations of the role of wave equations in quantum theory, and caution us that superpositions of quantum states for the formation of qubits may be more limited than usually expected.",17,[],5

1704.06098,physics,"The moist-air entropy can be used to analyze and better understand the general circulation of the atmosphere or convective motions. Isentropic analyses are commonly based on studies of different equivalent potential temperatures, all of which are assumed to fully represent the entropy of moist air. It is, however, possible to rely either on statistical physics or the third law of thermodynamics when defining and computing the absolute entropy of moist air and to study the corresponding third-law potential temperature, which is different from the previous ones. The third law assumes that the entropy for the most stable crystalline state of all substances is zero when approaching absolute zero temperature.   This paper shows that the way all these moist-air potential temperatures are defined has a large impact on: (i) the plotting of the isentropes for a simulation of the Hurricane DUMILE; (ii) the changes in moist-air entropy computed for a steam cycle defined for this Hurricane; (iii) the analyses of isentropic stream functions computed for this Hurricane; and (iv) the computations of the heat input, the work function, and the efficiency defined for this steam cycle.   The moist-air entropy is a state function and the isentropic analyses must be completely determined by the local moist-air conditions.

1702.05477,physics,"We present a new concept for a multi-stage Zeeman decelerator that is optimized particularly for applications in molecular beam scattering experiments. The decelerator consists of a series of alternating hexapoles and solenoids, that effectively decouple the transverse focusing and longitudinal deceleration properties of the decelerator. It can be operated in a deceleration and acceleration mode, as well as in a hybrid mode that makes it possible to guide a particle beam through the decelerator at constant speed. The deceleration features phase stability, with a relatively large six-dimensional phase-space acceptance. The separated focusing and deceleration elements result in an unequal partitioning of this acceptance between the longitudinal and transverse directions. This is ideal in scattering experiments, which typically benefit from a large longitudinal acceptance combined with narrow transverse distributions. We demonstrate the successful experimental implementation of this concept using a Zeeman decelerator consisting of an array of 25 hexapoles and 24 solenoids. The performance of the decelerator in acceleration, deceleration and guiding modes is characterized using beams of metastable Helium (equation) atoms. Up to 60 % of the kinetic energy was removed for He atoms that have an initial velocity of 520 m/s. The hexapoles consist of permanent magnets, whereas the solenoids are produced from a single hollow copper capillary through which cooling liquid is passed.

1711.06911,physics,"Discretized vortex-producing lenses programmed on low performance spatial light modulators have been used for the generation of optical vortices. However, the description of these vortices has been supported only by numerical simulations. In this work, a general analytical treatment (any topological charge - any discretization levels) for the propagation of a Gaussian beam through a discretized vortex-producing lens is presented. The resulting field could be expressed as a sum of Kummer beams with different amplitudes and topological charges focalized at different planes, whose characteristics of formation can be modified by tuning the parameters of the setup. Likewise, vortex lines are analyzed to understand the mechanism of formation of observed topological charges, which appear in specific planes. Conservation of the topological charge is demonstrated. Theoretical predictions are supported by experiments.",17,[],5

However, in real optomechanical crystals, imperfections open extra channels where the transfer of energy is lost, reducing the optomechanical coupling eficiency. Here, we quantify the role of disorder in a paradigmatic one-dimensional optomechanical crystal with full phononic and photonic bandgaps. We show how disorder can be exploited as a resource to enhance the optomechanical coupling beyond engineered structures, thus providing a new toolset for optomechanics.",17,[],5
1703.00708,physics,"The relaxation of a helical magnetic field equation in a high-conductivity plasma contained in the annulus between two perfectly conducting coaxial cylinders is considered. The plasma is of low density and its pressure is negligible compared with the magnetic pressure; the flow of the plasma is driven by the Lorentz force and and energy is dissipated primarily by the viscosity of the medium. The axial and toroidal fluxes of magnetic field are conserved in the perfect-conductivity limit, as is the mass per unit axial length. The magnetic field relaxes during a rapid initial stage to a force-free state, and then decays slowly, due to the effect of weak resistivity equation, while constrained to remain approximately force-free. Interest centres on whether the relaxed field may attain a Taylor state; but under the assumed conditions with axial and toroidal flux conserved inside every cylindrical Lagrangian surface, this is not possible. The effect of an additional equation-effect associated with instabilities and turbulence in the plasma is therefore investigated in exploratory manner. An assumed pseudo-scalar form of equation proportional to equation is adopted, where equation and equation is an equation dimensionless parameter. It is shown that, when equation is less that a critical value equation, the evolution remains smooth and similar to that for equation; but that if equation, negative-diffusivity effects act on the axial component of equation, generating high-frequency rapidly damped oscillations and an associated transitory appearance of reversed axial field. However, the scalar quantity equation remains highly non-uniform, so that again the field shows no sign of relaxing to a Taylor state for which equation would have to be constant.",17,[],5
1709.02385,physics,"The future space-based gravitational wave detector Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) requires bidirectional exchange of light between its two optical benches on board of each of its three satellites. The current baseline foresees a polarization-maintaining single-mode fiber for this backlink connection. Phase changes which are common in both directions do not enter the science measurement, but differential (""non-reciprocal"") phase fluctuations directly do and must thus be guaranteed to be small enough. We have built a setup consisting of a Zerodurequation baseplate with fused silica components attached to it using hydroxide-catalysis bonding and demonstrated the reciprocity of a polarization-maintaining single-mode fiber at the 1 pm/equation level as is required for LISA. We used balanced detection to reduce the influence of parasitic optical beams on the reciprocity measurement and a fiber length stabilization to avoid nonlinear effects in our phase measurement system (phase meter). For LISA, a different phase meter is planned to be used that does not show this nonlinearity. We corrected the influence of beam angle changes and temperature changes on the reciprocity measurement in post-processing.",17,[],5
1710.03060,physics,"A family of compressible exact periodic solutions is reported for the first time in an open cavity flow setup. These are found using a novel framework which permits the computation of such solutions in an arbitrary complex geometry. The periodic orbits arise from a synchronised concatenation of convective and acoustic events which strongly depend on the Mach number. This flow-acoustic interaction furnishes the periodic solutions with a remarkable stability and it is found to completely dominate the system's dynamics and the sound directivity. The periodic orbits, which could be called `exact Rossiter modes', collapse with a family of equilibrium solutions at a subcritical Hopf bifurcation, occurring in the quasi-incompressible regime. This shows compressibility has a destabilising effect in cavity flows, which we analyse in detail. By establishing a connection with previous 2D and 3D stability studies of cavity flows, we are able to isolate the effect of purely compressible two-dimensional flow phenomena across Mach number. A linear stability analysis of the equilibria provides insight into the compressible flow mechanisms responsible for the instability. A close look at the adjoint modes suggests that an eigenvalue merge occurs at a Mach number between 0.35 and 0.4, which boosts the receptivity of the leading mode and determines the onset of the unstable character of the system. The effect of the choice of base flow over the transition dynamics is also discussed, where in the present case, the frequencies associated to the leading eigenmodes show a strong connection with the frequencies of the periodic orbits at the same Mach numbers.",17,[],5
1708.00676,physics,"We explore time-resolved Coulomb explosion induced by intense, extreme ultraviolet (XUV) femtosecond pulses from the FLASH free-electron laser as a method to image photo-induced molecular dynamics in two molecules, iodomethane and 2,6-difluoroiodobenzene. At an excitation wavelength of 267\,nm, the dominant reaction pathway in both molecules is neutral dissociation via cleavage of the carbon--iodine bond. This allows investigating the influence of the molecular environment on the absorption of an intense, femtosecond XUV pulse and the subsequent Coulomb explosion process. We find that the XUV probe pulse induces local inner-shell ionization of atomic iodine in dissociating iodomethane, in contrast to non-selective ionization of all photofragments in difluoroiodobenzene. The results reveal evidence of electron transfer from methyl and phenyl moieties to a multiply charged iodine ion. In addition, indications for ultrafast charge rearrangement on the phenyl radical are found, suggesting that time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging is sensitive to the localization of charge in extended molecules.",17,[],5

The GPU version is largely defined by a framework that simplifies implementations of the fundamental kernel types that are used by Elegant: particle operations, reductions, particle loss, histograms, array convolutions and random number generation. Accelerated performance on the Titan Cray XK-7 supercomputer is approximately 6-10 times better with the GPU than all the CPU cores associated with the same node count. In addition to performance, the maintainability of the GPU-accelerated version of the code was considered a key design objective.

1705.02626,physics,"In this paper, we derive analytical expressions for the leading-order hydrodynamic mobility of a small solid particle undergoing motion tangential to a nearby large spherical capsule whose membrane possesses resistance towards shearing and bending. Together with the results obtained in the first part (Daddi-Moussa-Ider and Gekle, Phys. Rev. E \bfseries 95, 013108 (2017)) where the axisymmetric motion perpendicular to the capsule membrane is considered, the solution of the general mobility problem is thus determined. We find that shearing resistance induces a low-frequency peak in the particle self-mobility, resulting from the membrane normal displacement in the same way, although less pronounced, to what has been observed for the axisymmetric motion. In the zero frequency limit, the self-mobility correction near a hard sphere is recovered only if the membrane has a non-vanishing resistance towards shearing. We further compute the particle in-plane mean-square displacement of a nearby diffusing particle, finding that the membrane induces a long-lasting subdiffusive regime. Considering capsule motion, we find that the correction to the pair-mobility function is solely determined by membrane shearing properties. Our analytical calculations are compared and validated with fully resolved boundary integral simulations where a very good agreement is obtained.",17,[],5
1701.05043,physics,"We report an accessible and robust tool for evaluating the effects of Coulomb collisions on a test particle in a plasma that obeys Maxwell-Juttner statistics. The implementation is based on the Beliaev-Budker collision integral which allows both the test particle and the background plasma to be relativistic. The integration method supports adaptive time stepping, which is shown to greatly improve the computational efficiency. The Monte Carlo method is implemented for both the three-dimensional particle momentum space and the five-dimensional guiding center phase space.   Detailed description is provided for both the physics and implementation of the operator. The focus is in adaptive integration of stochastic differential equations, which is an overlooked aspect among existing Monte Carlo implementations of Coulomb collision operators. We verify that our operator converges to known analytical results and demonstrate that careless implementation of the adaptive time step can lead to severely erroneous results.   The operator is provided as a self-contained Fortran 95 module and can be included into existing orbit-following tools that trace either the full Larmor motion or the guiding center dynamics. The adaptive time-stepping algorithm is expected to be useful in situations where the collision frequencies vary greatly over the course of a simulation. Examples include the slowing-down of fusion products or other fast ions, and the Dreicer generation of runaway electrons as well as the generation of fast ions or electrons with ion or electron cyclotron resonance heating.",17,[],5
1710.03570,physics,"We consider two specific thermodynamic cycles of engine operating in a finite time coupled to two thermal reservoirs with a finite heat capacity: The Carnot-type cycle and the Lorenz-type cycle. By means of the endo-reversible thermodynamics, we then discuss the power output of engine and its optimization. In doing so, we treat the temporal duration of a single cycle rigorously, i.e., without neglecting the duration of its adiabatic parts. Then we find that the maximally obtainable power output Pm and the engine efficiency letterm at the point of Pm explicitly depend on the heat conductance and the compression ratio. From this, it is immediate to observe that the well-known results available in many references, in particular the (compression-ratio-independent) Curzon-Ahlborn-Novikov expressions such as letterm to letterCAN = 1 - (TL/TH)(1/2) with the temperatures (TH, TL) of hot and cold reservoirs only, can be recovered, but, significantly enough, in the limit of a vanishingly small heat conductance and an infinitely large compression ratio only.

1701.06157,physics,"Breakup of drop/bubble can be viewed as a result of fundamental force balance when the disruptive force is greater than the restorative force. A disruptive force acting on the drop/bubble tries to deform it, whereas a restorative force refrains it from deforming. Studying breakup and coalescence phenomenon is utmost important since it governs the amount of interfacial area and hence the exchange of heat, mass and momentum across the interface. It also helps in the development of better closure relations for modeling large scale systems.   In this paper, abundant literature consisting of theoretical, experimental and numerical works up to date is reviewed. Broadly, breakup is classified into viscous, inertial and complex turbulent breakup. Physics involved and non-dimensional numbers governing the drop and bubble breakup in various flow configurations are discussed. Characteristic parameters of the breakup such as critical diameter (equation), maximum deformation, breakup time (equation), wavelength of disturbance (equation), impurities in the flow, initial shape of the drop/bubble, history of the flow and critical values of non-dimensional numbers are examined and the important parameters are listed for ready-to-use in modeling approaches.

We derive a Born approximation-based generalized Hilbert transform for a specific invisibility arrangement relating the two quadratures of the complex permittivity of an object. The theoretical proposal is confirmed by numerical calculations, indicating that near-perfect invisibility can be attained for arbitrary objects with low-index contrast. We further demonstrate the cases where the idea can be extended to high-index objects or restricted to within practical limits by avoiding gain areas. The proposed concept opens a new route for the practical implementation of complex-shaped objects with arbitrarily suppressed scatterings determined on demand.",17,[],5

We establish that the sole effect of coarse graining, which mimics the `winner takes all' electoral college system in the US, can give rise to finite probabilities of such events of minority candidate winning even in the large size limit near the critical point. The overall probabilities of victory of the minority candidate can be predicted from the models which indicates that one may expect more instances of minority candidate winning in the future.",17,[],5

This includes relatively regularly shaped energy surfaces in a regime where the Zeeman splitting is large compared to the scattering interaction but small compared to the Rydberg fine structure, as well as more complex structures for both, weaker and stronger fields.

1709.00318,physics,"The idea that excitonic state (electronic) coherences are of fundamental importance to natural photosynthesis gained popularity when, a decade ago, slowly dephasing quantum beats were observed in the two-dimensional electronic spectra of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex at 77 K. These were assigned to quantum superpositions of excitonic states; a controversial interpretation, as the spectral linewidths suggested fast dephasing arising from strong interactions with the environment. While it has been pointed out that vibrational motion produces similar spectral signatures, concrete assignment of these coherences to distinct physical processes is still lacking. Here we revisit the coherence dynamics of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex using polarization-controlled two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy, supported by theoretical modelling. We show that the long-lived quantum beats originate exclusively from vibrational coherences, whereas electronic coherences dephase entirely within 240 fs even at 77 K - a timescale too short to play a significant role in light harvesting. Additionally, we demonstrate that specific vibrational coherences are excited via vibronically coupled states.

We derive three asymptotic systems of equations that describe slowly evolving (in comparison with the vibration frequency) free-surface waves. The first set of equations is obtained without assuming that the waves are long. These equations are as difficult to solve as the exact equations for irrotational water waves in a non-vibrating fluid. The other two models describe long waves. These models are obtained under two different assumptions about the amplitude of the vibration. Surprisingly, the governing equations have exactly the same form in both cases (up to interpretation of some constants). These equations reduce to the standard dispersionless shallow-water equations if the vibration is absent, and the vibration manifests itself via an additional term which makes the equations dispersive and, for small-amplitude waves, is similar to the term that would appear if surface tension were taken into account. We show that our dispersive shallow water equations have both solitary and periodic travelling waves solutions and discuss an analogy between these solutions and travelling capillary-gravity waves in a non-vibrating fluid.",17,[],5

However, radiation damage to calorimeter sensors may be dominated by hadrons induced by nuclear interactions of shower photons, which are much more likely to contribute to the non-ionizing energy loss that has been observed to damage sensors exposed to hadronic radiation.

In contrast, in the high x-ray intensity regime, the sample experiences severe ionization via x-ray multiphoton multiple ionization dynamics. Thus, it becomes necessary to take into account all the contributions to the Compton scattering signal when atoms are exposed to high-intensity x-ray pulses provided by x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs). In this paper, we investigate the Compton spectra of atoms at high x-ray intensity, using an extension of the integrated x-ray atomic physics toolkit, \textscxatom.

Here we report the discovery of a new optofluidics principle and demonstrate the generation of a steady-state water flow by a pulsed laser beam through a glass window. In order to generate a flow or stream in the same path as the refracted laser beam in pure water from an arbitrary spot on the window, we first fill a glass cuvette with an aqueous solution of Au nanoparticles. A flow will emerge from the focused laser spot on the window after the laser is turned on for a few to tens of minutes, the flow remains after the colloidal solution is completely replaced by pure water. Microscopically, this transformation is made possible by an underlying plasmonic nanoparticle-decorated cavity which is self-fabricated on the glass by nanoparticle-assisted laser etching and exhibits size and shape uniquely tailored to the incident beam profile. Hydrophone signals indicate that the flow is driven via acoustic streaming by a long-lasting ultrasound wave that is resonantly generated by the laser and the cavity through the photoacoustic effect.

We show experimentally that mutual interference of magnetic and electric dipole moments supported by the dielectric nanoantenna results in opposite propagation of the excited surface waves whose wavelengths differ by less than 50 nm in the optical range. Broadband reconfigurability of the nanoantennas operational range is achieved simply by varying the diameter of the silicon sphere. Moreover, despite subwavelength size (equation) of the proposed nanoantennas, they demonstrate highly efficient and directional launching of surface waves both in the forward and backward directions with the measured front-to-back ratio having a contrast of almost two orders of magnitude within a 50 nm spectral band.

A recent kinetic model for the isomers of butanol was imported into a common database. Individual reaction rate and thermodynamic parameters of species were varied using values encountered in combustion models from recent literature. The effects of over 1600 alternative parameters were considered. Separately, experimental data were collected from recent publications and converted into the standard YAML-based ChemKED format. The Cantera-based model validation tool, PyTeCK, was used to automatically simulate autoignition using the generated models and experimental data, to judge the performance of the models. Taken individually, most of the parameter substitutions have little effect on the overall model performance, although a handful have quite large effects, and are investigated more thoroughly.

In this paper, with a superfine focused X-ray beam we design a focused-X-ray luminescence tomography (FXLT) system for spatial resolution better than 150 micrometers and molecular sensitivity of 2 micromolar. First, we describe our system design. Then, we demonstrate that the molecular sensitivity of FXLT is about 5 micromolar considering the emitted visible photons from background. Furthermore, we analyze the measurement time per scan from measured photons numbers with a fiber bundle-PMT setup, report numerical and experimental results. Finally, we specify the imaging system performance based on numerical simulations and physical measurements.",17,[],5
1708.08405,physics,"We explore the dynamical response of dissipative Kerr solitons to changes in pump power and detuning and show how thermal and nonlinear processes couple these parameters to the frequency-comb degrees of freedom. Our experiments are enabled by a Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) stabilization approach that provides on-demand, radiofrequency control of the frequency comb. PDH locking not only guides Kerr-soliton formation from a cold microresonator, but opens a path to decouple the repetition and carrier-envelope-offset frequencies. In particular, we demonstrate phase stabilization of both Kerr-comb degrees-of-freedom to a fractional frequency precision below 10-16, compatible with optical-timekeeping technology. Moreover, we investigate the fundamental role that residual laser-resonator detuning noise plays in the spectral purity of microwave generation with Kerr combs.",17,[],5
1711.03586,physics,"We looked for a biological analogy to developed an improved surface coil to acquire magnetic resonance images. Nature offers engineering solutions that can be exploited to improve the performance of devices, such as MRI RF coils. In this paper, we proposed a coil layout based on flower petal patterns for UHF MRI at 15.2 T. This particular configuration offers the possibility to use a different number of petals and shapes. The petal resonator coil and the magnetron coil have similar layouts, which have proved to outperform the popular circular coil. Phantom images were acquired with our coil prototype to demonstrate it feasibility. These phantom images show no image degradation caused by the mutual inductance of the adjacent petals in both orientations. The SNR was also calculated using the image data and giving 31.16. Phantom images showed the coil viability and compatibility with conventional pulse sequences at 15.2 T. It still remains to investigate whether this bio-inspired surface coil is able to outperformed the popular circular coil.",17,[],5
1707.06832,physics,"In nature, phase transitions prevail amongst inherently different systems, while frequently showing a universal behavior at their critical point. As a fundamental phenomenon of fluid mechanics, recent studies suggested laminar-turbulent transition belonging to the universality class of directed percolation. Beyond, no indication was yet found that directed percolation is encountered in technical relevant fluid mechanics. Here, we present first evidence that the onset of a laminar separation bubble on an airfoil can be well characterized employing the directed percolation model on high fidelity particle image velocimetry data. In an extensive analysis, we show that the obtained critical exponents are robust against parameter fluctuations, namely threshold of turbulence intensity that distinguishes between ambient flow and laminar separation bubble. Our findings indicate a comprehensive significance of percolation models in fluid mechanics beyond fundamental flow phenomena, in particular, it enables the precise determination of the transition point of the laminar separation bubble. This opens a broad variety of new fields of application, ranging from experimental airfoil aerodynamics to computational fluid dynamics.",17,[],5
1706.06129,physics,"The on-demand tailoring of light's spatial shape is of great relevance in a wide variety of research areas. Computer-controlled devices, such as Spatial Light Modulators (SLMs) or Digital Micromirror Devices (DMDs), offer a very accurate, flexible and fast holographic means to this end. Remarkably, digital holography affords the simultaneous generation of multiple beams (multiplexing), a tool with numerous applications in many fields. Here, we provide a self-contained tutorial on light beam multiplexing. Through the use of several examples, the readers will be guided step by step in the process of light beam shaping and multiplexing.

1703.01685,physics,"The predictions of parameteric property models and their uncertainties are sensitive to systematic errors such as inconsistent reference data, parametric model assumptions, or inadequate computational methods. Here, we discuss the calibration of property models in the light of bootstrapping, a sampling method akin to Bayesian inference that can be employed for identifying systematic errors and for reliable estimation of the prediction uncertainty. We apply bootstrapping to assess a linear property model linking the 57Fe Moessbauer isomer shift to the contact electron density at the iron nucleus for a diverse set of 44 molecular iron compounds. The contact electron density is calculated with twelve density functionals across Jacob's ladder (PWLDA, BP86, BLYP, PW91, PBE, M06-L, TPSS, B3LYP, B3PW91, PBE0, M06, TPSSh). We provide systematic-error diagnostics and reliable, locally resolved uncertainties for isomer-shift predictions. Pure and hybrid density functionals yield average prediction uncertainties of 0.06-0.08 mm/s and 0.04-0.05 mm/s, respectively, the latter being close to the average experimental uncertainty of 0.02 mm/s. Furthermore, we show that both model parameters and prediction uncertainty depend significantly on the composition and number of reference data points. Accordingly, we suggest that rankings of density functionals based on performance measures (e.g., the coefficient of correlation, r2, or the root-mean-square error, RMSE) should not be inferred from a single data set. This study presents the first statistically rigorous calibration analysis for theoretical Moessbauer spectroscopy, which is of general applicability for physico-chemical property models and not restricted to isomer-shift predictions. We provide the statistically meaningful reference data set MIS39 and a new calibration of the isomer shift based on the PBE0 functional.",17,[],5
1701.02998,physics,"Starting from a statistical model of the electron, which explains spin and spin measurements in terms of a probability density distribution resulting from a rapidly changing angular momentum during an extended Zitterbewegung, a light-like model of electron and Fermions is formulated. This model describes individual particles in terms of paths of a moving quantum. It is shown that this description allows one to reproduce observable properties as path-averages over a period of the fast extended Zitterbewegung in elementary calculations. The general topology of the paths may be described as a helical path, with a helix axis forming a circle around a fixed point in space. The radius of the helix and of the circle are equal and given by half the reduced Compton wave length of a photon of energy equal to the rest energy of the particle described. The paths depend on the relative velocity between the described entity and the observer, and represent the De Broglie wave. The merits of the proposed model are summarized and its role in relation to the established description by quantum mechanics discussed. It is concluded that it supports the existence of the proposed extended Zitterbewegung, and offers a description of quantum behaviour without quantum mechanics.",17,[],5
1708.00244,physics,"Computed tomography (CT) images containing metallic objects commonly show severe streaking and shadow artifacts. Metal artifacts are caused by nonlinear beam-hardening effects combined with other factors such as scatter and Poisson noise. In this paper, we propose an implant-specific method that extracts beam-hardening artifacts from CT images without affecting the background image. We found that in cases where metal is inserted in the water (or tissue), the generated beam-hardening artifacts can be approximately extracted by subtracting artifacts generated exclusively by metals. We used a deep learning technique to train nonlinear representations of beam-hardening artifacts arising from metals, which appear as shadows and streaking artifacts. The proposed network is not designed to identify ground-truth CT images (i.e., the CT image before its corruption by metal artifacts). Consequently, these images are not required for training. The proposed method was tested on a dataset consisting of real CT scans of pelvises containing simulated hip prostheses. The results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning method successfully extracts both shadowing and streaking artifacts.",17,[],5

We develop the general reconstruction procedure of the equation form that can yield the holographic feature of the dark energy. We fit the reconstructed model with the equation data and our results show a perfect agreement with the WMAP9 cosmological observational data, at least for the range equation. We investigate the consistency of the reconstructed model by studying its stability against linear gravitational and matter perturbations, fixing equation to equation. The model presents stability for both de Sitter and power-law solutions and we conclude that it is a good candidate as alternative viable model for characterizing holographic dark energy.",17,[],5
1712.00910,physics,"We provide a general framework for analyzing degree correlations between nodes separated by more than one step (i.e., beyond nearest neighbors) in complex networks. One probability and four conditional probabilities are introduced to fully describe long-range degree correlations with respect to equation and equation of two nodes and shortest path length equation between them. We present general relations among these probabilities and clarify the relevance to nearest-neighbor degree correlations. Unlike nearest-neighbor correlations, some of these probabilities are meaningful only in finite-size networks. Furthermore, as a baseline to determine the existence or nonexistence of long-range degree correlations in a network, the functional forms of these probabilities for networks without any long-range degree correlations are analytically evaluated within a mean-field approximation. The validity of our argument is demonstrated by applying it to real-world networks.",17,[],5
1701.03554,physics,"We investigate, numerically and experimentally, the effect of thermo-optical (TO) chaos on direct soliton generation (DSG) in microresonators. When the pump laser is scanned from blue to red and then stopped at a fixed wavelength, we find that the solitons generated sometimes remain (survive) and sometimes annihilate subsequent to the end of the scan. We refer to the possibility of these different outcomes arising under identical laser scan conditions as coexistence of soliton annihilation and survival. Numerical simulations that include the thermal dynamics show that the coexistence of soliton annihilation and survival is explained by TO chaos accompanying comb generation. The random fluctuations of the cavity resonance occurring under TO chaos are also found to trigger spontaneous soliton generation after the laser scan ends. The coexistence of soliton annihilation and survival as well as spontaneous soliton generation are observed experimentally in a silicon-nitride microresonator. The elucidation of the role of TO chaos provides important insights into the soliton generation dynamics in microresonators, which may eventually facilitate straightforward soliton generation in fully-integrated microresonators.",17,[],5

A lot of more accurate historical reconstructions, conducted under the stimulus of that recurrence, placed the birth date of quantum theory in March 1905 when Einstein advanced his light quantum hypothesis. Both interpretations are yet controversial, but science historians agree on one point: the emergence of quantum theory from a presumed ""crisis"" of classical physics is a myth with scarce adherence to the historical truth. This article, written in Italian language, was originally presented in connection with the celebration of the World Year of Phyics 2005 with the aim of bringing these scholarly theses to a wider audience.   ---   Tradizionalmente la nascita della teoria quantistica viene fatta risalire al 14 dicembre 1900, quando Planck present\`o all'Accademia delle Scienze di Berlino la dimostrazione della formula della radiazione termica.

As an example we show an electrically deep sub-wavelength dimer of meta-atoms with extremely sensitive response to the direction-of-arrival of an impinging electromagnetic wave.

Renormalised partial directed coherence (rPDC) is a frequency-domain representation of the concept of Granger causality while directed partial correlation (DPC) is an alternative approach for quantifying Granger causality in the time domain. Both methodologies have been successfully applied to neurophysiological signals for detecting directed relationships. This paper introduces their application to climatological time series. We first discuss the application to ENSO -- Monsoon interaction, and then apply the methodologies to the more challenging air-sea interaction in the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). While in the first case the results obtained are fully consistent with present knowledge in climate modeling, in the second case the results are, as expected, less clear, and to fully elucidate the SACZ air-sea interaction, further investigations on the specificity and sensitivity of these methodologies are needed.",17,[],5

The rays retracing skewed V-shaped paths in the resonator are phase-locked to form vortex laser with wavefront dislocation mirroring the topological charge of the SPP. Experimental demonstrations on diode-pumped solid state system using Nd:YAG crystal emitted randomly polarized optical vortices at a wavelength of 1064nm when the pump power went above 1.52W and the slope efficiency was 0.19.

1708.02124,physics,"For the analysis of molecular processes, the estimation of time-scales, i.e., transition rates, is very important. Estimating the transition rates between molecular conformations is -- from a mathematical point of view -- an invariant subspace projection problem. A certain infinitesimal generator acting on function space is projected to a low-dimensional rate matrix. This projection can be performed in two steps. First, the infinitesimal generator is discretized, then the invariant subspace is approxi-mated and used for the subspace projection. In our approach, the discretization will be based on a Voronoi tessellation of the conformational space. We will show that the discretized infinitesimal generator can simply be approximated by the geometric average of the Boltzmann weights of the Voronoi cells. Thus, there is a direct correla-tion between the potential energy surface of molecular structures and the transition rates of conformational changes.

The estimated values of equation and equation show strong frequency dependence. The relationships emerge to be equation and equation, respectively.

These electromagnetic signals mainly propagate along the softmaterial waveguide which is basically composed of dielectric membrane, sandwiched in two ionic liquid layers at both sides. In myelinated axons, the dielectric layer is as thick as several microns as it consists of tens of lipid bilayers.

Environmental degrees of freedom of such a system have no time to relax to quasi-equilibrium in the electronic excited state of the donor molecule, and thus the conditions of validity of Foerster and Modified Redfield theories in their standard formulations do not apply. We derive non-equilibrium versions of the two well-known rate theories and apply them to the case of carotenoid-chlorophyll energy transfer. Although our reduced density matrix approach does not account for the formation of vibronic excitons, it still confirms the important role of the donor ground-state vibrational states in establishing the resonance energy transfer conditions.

In order to learn such sequences of decisions, a mechanism to link earlier actions to later reward is necessary. Reinforcement learning theory suggests two classes of algorithms solving this credit assignment problem: In classic temporal-difference learning, earlier actions receive reward information only after multiple repetitions of the task, whereas models with eligibility traces reinforce entire sequences of actions from a single experience (one-shot). Here we asked whether humans use eligibility traces. We developed a novel paradigm to directly observe which actions and states along a multi-step sequence are reinforced after a single reward. By focusing our analysis on those states for which RL with and without eligibility trace make qualitatively distinct predictions, we find direct behavioral (choice probability) and physiological (pupil dilation) signatures of reinforcement learning with eligibility trace across multiple sensory modalities.",17,[],10
1707.03779,q-bio,"DDX3X is a human DEAD-box RNA helicase implicated in many cancers and in viral progression. In addition to the RecA-like catalytic core, DDX3X contains N- and C-terminal domains. Here, we investigate the substrate and protein requirements to support the ATPase activity of a DDX3X construct lacking 80 residues from its C-terminal domain. Our data confirmed previous results that for an RNA molecule to support the ATPase activity of DDX3X it must contain a single-stranded-double-stranded region. We investigated protein and RNA structural reasons for this requirement. First, the RNA substrates consisting only of a double-helix were unable to support DDX3X binding. A single-stranded RNA substrate supported DDX3X binding, while an RNA substrate consisting of a single-stranded-double-stranded region not only supported the binding of DDX3X to RNA, but also promoted DDX3X trimer formation. Thus, the single-stranded-double-stranded RNA region is needed for DDX3X trimer formation, and trimer formation is required for ATPase activity. Interestingly, the dependence of ATP hydrolysis on the protein concentration suggests that the DDX3X trimer hydrolyzes only two molecules of ATP. Lastly, a DNA substrate that contains single-stranded-double-stranded regions does not support the ATPase activity of DDX3X.",17,[],10

Notably, the ability to locate a suitable structural template by homology or fold recognition is crucial; without this models will be of low quality at best. With a template avail- able, the quality of the query-template alignment crucially determines the model quality.

1701.08404,q-bio,"Motivation: Cellular Electron CryoTomography (CECT) enables 3D visualization of cellular organization at near-native state and in sub-molecular resolution, making it a powerful tool for analyzing structures of macromolecular complexes and their spatial organizations inside single cells. However, high degree of structural complexity together with practical imaging limitations make the systematic de novo discovery of structures within cells challenging. It would likely require averaging and classifying millions of subtomograms potentially containing hundreds of highly heterogeneous structural classes. Although it is no longer difficult to acquire CECT data containing such amount of subtomograms due to advances in data acquisition automation, existing computational approaches have very limited scalability or discrimination ability, making them incapable of processing such amount of data.   Results: To complement existing approaches, in this paper we propose a new approach for subdividing subtomograms into smaller but relatively homogeneous subsets. The structures in these subsets can then be separately recovered using existing computation intensive methods. Our approach is based on supervised structural feature extraction using deep learning, in combination with unsupervised clustering and reference-free classification. Our experiments show that, compared to existing unsupervised rotation invariant feature and pose-normalization based approaches, our new approach achieves significant improvements in both discrimination ability and scalability.

We derive simple eligibility and stability thresholds, both of which must be satisfied if intergenerational care is first to evolve and then to persist in a population. As one threshold becomes easier to fulfill, the other becomes more difficult, revealing a conflict between the two.

1710.05098,q-bio,"The interplay between excitatory and inhibitory neurons imparts rich functions of the brain. To understand the underlying synaptic mechanisms, a fundamental approach is to study the dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory conductances of each neuron. The traditional method of determining conductance employs the synaptic current-voltage (I-V) relation obtained via voltage clamp. Using theoretical analysis, electrophysiological experiments, and realistic simulations, here we demonstrate that the traditional method conceptually fails to measure the conductance due to the neglect of a nonlinear interaction between the clamp current and the synaptic current. Consequently, it incurs substantial measurement error, even giving rise to unphysically negative conductance as observed in experiments. To elucidate synaptic impact on neuronal information processing, we introduce the concept of effective conductance and propose a framework to determine it accurately. Our work suggests re-examination of previous studies involving conductance measurement and provides a reliable approach to assess synaptic influence on neuronal computation.",17,[],10

1712.04680,q-bio,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is closely linked with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatic insulin resistance, but the involved mechanisms are still elusive. Using DNA methylome and transcriptome analyses of livers from obese individuals, we found that both hypomethylation at a CpG site in PDGFA (encoding platelet derived growth factor alpha) and PDGFA overexpression are associated with increased T2D risk, hyperinsulinemia, increased insulin resistance and increased steatohepatitis risk. Both genetic risk score studies and human cell modeling pointed to a causative impact of high insulin levels on PDGFA CpG site hypomethylation, PDGFA overexpression, and increased PDGF-AA secretion from liver. We found that PDGF-AA secretion further stimulates its own expression through protein kinase C activity and contributes to insulin resistance through decreased expression of both insulin receptor substrate 1 and of insulin receptor. Importantly, hepatocyte insulin sensitivity can be restored by PDGF-AA blocking antibodies, PDGF receptor inhibitors and by metformin opening therapeutic avenues. Conclusion: Therefore, in the liver of obese patients with T2D, the increased PDGF-AA signaling contributes to insulin resistance, opening new therapeutic avenues against T2D and NAFLD.",17,[],10

The latter phenomenon was observed experimentally but the cause seemed to be unclear. The mechanisms for these phenomena are examined with the help of the profiles of the ionic concentrations, electric fields and electrochemical potentials. The underlying reasons for the near zero flux of cation and for the decreasing flux of anion are shown to be different over different regions of the permanent charge. Our model is oversimplified.

The choice of the proteins is motivated by making attempts to understand formation and stability of foam in beer. We demonstrate that both proteins flatten out at the interface and can make a continuous stabilizing and denser film. We show that the degree of the flattening depends on the protein -- the layers of LTP1b should be denser than those of LTP1 -- and on the presence of glycation. It also depends on the number (equation) of the disulfide bonds in the proteins. The geometry of the proteins is sensitive to the specificity of the absent bonds.

1706.03920,q-bio,"In species reproducing both sexually and asexually clones are often more common in recently established populations. Earlier studies have suggested that this pattern arises from natural selection favouring asexual recruitment in young populations. Alternatively, as we show here, this pattern may result from stochastic processes during species-range expansions. We model a dioecious species expanding into a new area in which all individuals are capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction, and all individuals have equal survival rates and dispersal distances. Even under conditions that eventually favour sexual recruitment, colonisation starts with an asexual wave. Long after colonisation is completed, a sexual wave erodes clonal dominance. If individuals reproduce more than one season, and with only local dispersal, a few large clones typically dominate for thousands of reproductive seasons. Adding occasional long-distance dispersal, more dominant clones emerge, but they persist for a shorter period of time. The general mechanism involved is simple: edge effects at the expansion front favour asexual (uniparental) recruitment where potential mates are rare. Specifically, our stochastic model makes detailed predictions different from a selection model, and comparing these with empirical data from a postglacially established seaweed species (Fucus radicans) shows that in this case a stochastic mechanism is strongly supported.",17,[],10
1704.05942,q-bio,"Ammonium assimilation in E. coli is regulated by two paralogous proteins (GlnB and GlnK), which orchestrate interactions with regulators of gene expression, transport proteins and metabolic pathways. Yet how they conjointly modulate the activity of glutamine synthetase (GS), the key enzyme for nitrogen assimilation, is poorly understood. We combine experiments and theory to study the dynamic roles of GlnB and GlnK during nitrogen starvation and upshift. We measure time-resolved in vivo concentrations of metabolites, total and post-translationally modified proteins, and develop a concise biochemical model of GlnB and GlnK that incorporates competition for active and allosteric sites, as well as functional sequestration of GlnK.

Our results show that GlnK is tightly regulated under nitrogen-rich conditions, yet it is expressed during ammonium run-out and starvation. This suggests a role for GlnK as a buffer of nitrogen shock after starvation, and provides a further functional link between nitrogen and carbon metabolisms.",17,[],10
1702.03337,q-bio,"In multicellular organisms, relations among parts and between parts and the whole are contextual and interdependent. These organisms and their cells are ontogenetically linked: an organism starts as a cell that divides producing non-identical cells, which organize in tri-dimensional patterns. These association patterns and cells types change as tissues and organs are formed. This contextuality and circularity makes it difficult to establish detailed cause and effect relationships. Here we propose an approach to overcome these intrinsic difficulties by combining the use of two models; 1) an experimental one that employs 3D culture technology to obtain the structures of the mammary gland, namely, ducts and acini, and 2) a mathematical model based on biological principles. The typical approach for mathematical modeling in biology is to apply mathematical tools and concepts developed originally in physics or computer sciences. Instead, we propose to construct a mathematical model based on proper biological principles. Specifically, we use principles identified as fundamental for the elaboration of a theory of organisms, namely i) the default state of cell proliferation with variation and motility and ii) the principle of organization by closure of constraints. This model has a biological component, the cells, and a physical component, a matrix which contains collagen fibers. Cells display agency and move and proliferate unless constrained; they exert mechanical forces that i) act on collagen fibers and ii) on other cells. As fibers organize, they constrain the cells on their ability to move and to proliferate. The model exhibits a circularity that can be interpreted in terms of closure of constraints...",17,[],10
1703.00389,q-bio,"Despite its radical assumption of ecological equivalence between species, neutral biodiversity theory can often provide good fits to species abundance distributions observed in nature. Major criticisms of neutral theory have focused on interspecific differences, which are in conflict with ecological equivalence. However, neutrality in nature is also broken by differences between conspecific individuals at different life stages, which in many communities may vastly exceed interspecific differences between individuals at similar stages. These within-species asymmetries have not been fully explored in species-neutral models, and it is not known whether demographic stage structure affects macroecological patterns in neutral theory. Here we present a two-stage neutral model where fecundity and mortality change as an individual transitions from one stage to the other. We explore several qualitatively different scenarios, and compare numerically obtained species abundance distributions to the predictions of unstructured neutral theory. We find that abundance distributions are generally robust to this kind of stage structure, but significant departures from unstructured predictions occur if adults have sufficiently low fecundity and mortality. In addition, we show that the cumulative number of births per species, which is distributed as a power law with a 3/2 exponent, is invariant even when the abundance distribution departs from unstructured model predictions. Our findings potentially explain power law-like abundance distributions in organisms with strong demographic structure, such as eusocial insects and humans, and partially rehabilitate species abundance distributions from past criticisms as to their inability to distinguish between biological mechanisms.",17,[],10

1706.01757,q-bio,"Vision research has been shaped by the seminal insight that we can understand the higher-tier visual cortex from the perspective of multiple functional pathways with different goals. In this paper, we try to give a computational account of the functional organization of this system by reasoning from the perspective of multi-task deep neural networks. Machine learning has shown that tasks become easier to solve when they are decomposed into subtasks with their own cost function. We hypothesize that the visual system optimizes multiple cost functions of unrelated tasks and this causes the emergence of a ventral pathway dedicated to vision for perception, and a dorsal pathway dedicated to vision for action. To evaluate the functional organization in multi-task deep neural networks, we propose a method that measures the contribution of a unit towards each task, applying it to two networks that have been trained on either two related or two unrelated tasks, using an identical stimulus set. Results show that the network trained on the unrelated tasks shows a decreasing degree of feature representation sharing towards higher-tier layers while the network trained on related tasks uniformly shows high degree of sharing. We conjecture that the method we propose can be used to analyze the anatomical and functional organization of the visual system and beyond. We predict that the degree to which tasks are related is a good descriptor of the degree to which they share downstream cortical-units.",17,[],10

1710.05310,q-bio,"Despite being similar in structure, functioning, and size viral pathogens enjoy very different mostly well-defined ways of life. They occupy their hosts for a few days (influenza), for a few weeks (measles), or even lifelong (HCV), which manifests in acute or chronic infections. The various transmission routes (airborne, via direct contact, etc.), degrees of infectiousness (referring to the load required for transmission), antigenic variation/immune escape and virulence define further pathogenic lifestyles. To survive pathogens must infect new hosts; the success determines their fitness. Infection happens with a certain likelihood during contact of hosts, where contact can also be mediated by vectors. Besides structural aspects of the host-contact network, three parameters/concepts appear to be key: the contact rate and the infectiousness during contact, which encode the mode of transmission, and third the immunity of susceptible hosts. From here, what can be concluded about the evolutionary strategies of viral pathogens? This is the biological question addressed in this paper. The answer extends earlier results (Lange & Ferguson 2009, PLoS Comput Biol 5 (10): e1000536) and makes explicit connection to another basic work on the evolution of pathogens (Grenfell et al. 2004, Science 303: 327-332). A mathematical framework is presented that models intra- and inter-host dynamics in a minimalistic but unified fashion covering a broad spectrum of viral pathogens, including those that cause flu-like infections, childhood diseases, and sexually transmitted infections. These pathogens turn out as local maxima of the fitness landscape. The models involve differential- and integral equations, agent-based simulation, networks, and probability.",17,[],10
1712.00807,q-bio,"De novo prediction of protein folding is an open scientific challenge. Many folding models and force fields have been developed, yet all face difficulties converging to native conformations. Hydrophobicity scales (HSs) play a crucial role in such simulations as they define the energetic interactions between protein residues, thus determining the energetically favorable conformation. While many HSs have been developed over the years using various methods, it is surprising that the scales show very weak consensus in their assignment of hydrophobicity indexes to the various residues. In this work, several HSs are systematically assessed via atomistic Monte Carlo simulation of folding of small proteins, by converting the HSs of interest into residue-residue contact energy matrices. HSs that poorly preserve native structures of proteins were tuned by applying a linear transformation. Subsequently, folding simulations were used to examine the ability of the HSs to correctly fold the proteins from a random initial conformation. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) and energy of the proteins during folding were sampled and used to define an ER-score, as the correlation between the 2-dimensional energy-RMSD (ER) histogram with 50% lowest energy conformations and the ER histogram with 50% lowest RMSD conformations. Thus, we were able to compare the ability of the different HSs to predict de novo protein folding quantitatively.",17,[],10
1706.08040,q-bio,"In an iterated two-person game, for instance prisoner's dilemma or the snowdrift game, there exist strategies that force the payoffs of the opponents to be equal. These equalizer strategies form a subset of the more general zero-determinant strategies that unilaterally set the payoff of an opponent. A challenge in the attempts to understand the role of these strategies in the evolution of animal behavior is the lack of iterations in the fights for mating opportunities or territory control. We show that an arbitrary two-parameter strategy may possess a corresponding equalizer strategy which produces the same result: statistics of the fight outcomes in the contests with mutants are the same for each of these two strategies. Therefore, analyzing only the equalizer strategy space may be sufficient to predict animal behavior if nature, indeed, reduces (marginalizes) complex strategies to equalizer strategy space. The work's main finding is that there is a unique equalizer strategy that predicts fight outcomes without mutual cooperation. The lack of mutual cooperation is a common trait in conflict escalation contests that generally require a clear winner. In addition this unique strategy does not assess information of the opponent's state. The method bypasses the standard analysis of evolutionary stability. The results fit well the observations of combat between male bowl and doily spiders and support an empirical assumption of the war of attrition model that the species use only information regarding their own state during conflict escalation.",17,[],10
1711.08064,q-bio,"Background: Salinity is one of the major abiotic stresses affecting plant production in arid and semi-arid regions. It causes reduction of cultivable area and combined with other factors, presents a serious threat to food stability in these areas. Context: In front of this problem, the selection of salt tolerant species and varieties remains the best economic approach for exploitation and rehabilitation of salt-affected regions. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the seed germination response of six Acacia species under different NaCl concentrations in order to explore opportunities for selection and breeding salt tolerant genotypes. Methods: The salinity effect was examined by measuring some agro-morphological parameters in controlled growth environment using five treatment levels: 0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mM of NaCl. Results: The analyzed data revealed significant variability in salt response within and between species. All growth parameters were progressively reduced by increased NaCl concentrations. Growth in height, leaf number and total plant dry weight were considered as the most sensitive parameters. However, the growth reduction varied among species in accordance with their tolerance level. It is important to note that all species survived at the highest salinity (400 mM). Whereas A. horrida and A. raddiana were proved to be often the best tolerant, they recorded the lowest reduction percentage at this stage. Conclusion: The genetic variability found in the studied species at seedling stage may be used to select genotypes particularly suitable for rehabilitation and exploitation of lands affected by salinity.",17,[],10

1710.06593,q-bio,"Tumors of the eye and nervous system often exhibit an arch-like arrangement of nuclei, called rosettes. Pathologists are able to identify rosettes [full circles] and the presence of partial rosettes [semi-circles] and interpret this as a sign of differentiation in a tumor. However, there is no objective method to quantitate the many partial rosettes that are obvious or not obvious to the naked eye. This paper proposes a mathematical algorithm to computationally detect the presence of obvious or non-obvious partial rosettes, henceforth referred to as Nguyen-Wu Partial Rosettes. Quantifying the degree of partial rosettes present in a tumor may allow pathologists to stratify tumors into more refined groups that may respond better to therapy or have different clinical outcomes. The Midline Cross Product [MCP] algorithm calculates the magnitude of two cross products and adds them together to obtain one value. Each of the two cross products results from [1] the line that connects the midpoints of longest lengths of two neighboring ovals, and [2] the line that extends from the midpoint from one longest length and is perpendicular to that longest length. The MCP algorithm makes nuclei that are arranged in consecutive rows and arches quantitatively distinct from nuclei that are arranged next to each other in a disorderly manner.",17,[],10
1709.08591,q-bio,"Information needs to be appropriately encoded to be reliably transmitted over physical media. Similarly, neurons have their own codes to convey information in the brain. Even though it is well-known that neurons exchange information using a pool of several protocols of spatio-temporal encodings, the suitability of each code and their performance as a function of network parameters and external stimuli is still one of the great mysteries in neuroscience. This paper sheds light on this by modeling small-size networks of chemically and electrically coupled Hindmarsh-Rose spiking neurons. We focus on a class of temporal and firing-rate codes that result from neurons' membrane-potentials and phases, and quantify numerically their performance estimating the Mutual Information Rate, aka the rate of information exchange. Our results suggest that the firing-rate and interspike-intervals codes are more robust to additive Gaussian white noise. In a network of four interconnected neurons and in the absence of such noise, pairs of neurons that have the largest rate of information exchange using the interspike-intervals and firing-rate codes are not adjacent in the network, whereas spike-timings and phase codes (temporal) promote large rate of information exchange for adjacent neurons. If that result would have been possible to extend to larger neural networks, it would suggest that small microcircuits would preferably exchange information using temporal codes (spike-timings and phase codes), whereas on the macroscopic scale, where there would be typically pairs of neurons not directly connected due to the brain's sparsity, firing-rate and interspike-intervals codes would be the most efficient codes.",17,[],10

The high performance of multi-task deep neural networks in drug discovery has attracted the attention to deep learning algorithms in bioinformatics area. Here, we proposed a hierarchical multi-task deep neural network architecture based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms as a solution to protein function prediction problem and investigated various aspects of the proposed architecture by performing several experiments. First, we showed that there is a positive correlation between performance of the system and the size of training datasets. Second, we investigated whether the level of GO terms on GO hierarchy related to their performance. We showed that there is no relation between the depth of GO terms on GO hierarchy and their performance. In addition, we included all annotations to the training of a set of GO terms to investigate whether including noisy data to the training datasets change the performance of the system. The results showed that including less reliable annotations in training of deep neural networks increased the performance of the low performed GO terms, significantly. We evaluated the performance of the system using hierarchical evaluation method.

Together with appropriately designed SciUnit tests and methods to mine and visualise the databases, model data and test results, this extended framework has the potential to greatly facilitate the use of computational models in psychiatry.

1710.05692,q-bio,"In most models of collective motion in animal groups each individual updates its heading based on the current positions and headings of its neighbors. Several authors have investigated the effects of including anticipation into models of this type, and have found that anticipation inhibits polarized collective motion in alignment based models and promotes milling and swarming in the one attraction-repulsion model studied. However, it was recently reported that polarized collective motion does emerge in an alignment based asynchronous lattice model with mutual anticipation. To our knowledge this is the only reported case where polarized collective motion has been observed in a model with anticipation. Here we show that including anticipation induces polarized collective motion in a synchronous, off lattice, attraction based model. This establishes that neither asynchrony, mutual anticipation nor motion restricted to a lattice environment are strict requirements for anticipation to promote polarized collective motion. In addition, unlike alignment based models the attraction based model used here does not produce any type of polarized collective motion in the absence of anticipation. Here anticipation is a direct polarization inducing mechanism. We believe that utilizing anticipation instead of frequently used alternatives such as explicit alignment terms, asynchronous updates and asymmetric interactions to generate polarized collective motion may be advantageous in some cases.",17,[],10
1708.05384,q-bio,"The mathematical modelling of genetic-metabolic networks is of out most importance in the field of systems biology. Different formalisms and a huge variety of classical mathematical tools have been used to describe and analyse such networks. Michael A. Savageau defined a formalism to model genetic-metabolic networks called S-Systems, [12], [13], [15]. There is a limit in the number of nodes that can be analysed when these systems are solved using classical numerical methods such as non-linear dynamic analysis and linear optimization algorithms. We propose to use toric algebraic geometry to solve S-systems. In this work we prove that S-systems are toric varieties and that as a consequence Hilbert basis can be used to solve them. This is achieved by applying two theorems, proved here, the theorem about Embedding of S-Systems in toric varieties and the theorem about Toric Resolution on S-Systems. In addition, we define the realization of minimal phenotypic polytopes, phenotypic toric ideals and phenotypic toric varieties as a generalization of the phenotypic polytopes described by M.

We introduce several algorithmic novelties. Namely, these existing methods compute homogeneous graphlet-based node similarities and then find high-scoring alignments with respect to these similarities, while simultaneously maximizing the amount of conserved edges. Instead, we extend homogeneous graphlets to their heterogeneous counterparts, which we then use to develop a new measure of heterogeneous node similarity. Also, we extend equation, a state-of-the-art measure of edge conservation for homogeneous NA, to its heterogeneous counterpart.

These two aspects of alignment are orthogonal, and confounding them makes it difficult to evaluate them separately. A more systematic approach is needed. To this end, we bring these two orthogonal issues into sharp focus in two companion papers. In Part 1 (this paper) we show that simulated annealing, as implemented by SANA, far outperforms all other existing search algorithms across a wide range of objectives. Part 2 (our companion paper) then uses SANA to compare over a dozen objectives in terms of the biology they recover, demonstrating that some objective functions recover useful biological information while others do not.

The computation of the parameter sensitivities, however, poses many computational challenges when taking stochastic noise into account. This paper proposes a new finite difference method for efficiently computing sensitivities of biochemical reactions. We employ propensity bounds of reactions to couple the simulation of the nominal and perturbed processes. The exactness of the simulation is reserved by applying the rejection-based mechanism. For each simulation step, the nominal and perturbed processes under our coupling strategy are synchronized and often jump together, increasing their positive correlation and hence reducing the variance of the estimator. The distinctive feature of our approach in comparison with existing coupling approaches is that it only needs to maintain a single data structure storing propensity bounds of reactions during the simulation of the nominal and perturbed processes. Our approach allows to computing sensitivities of many reaction rates simultaneously. Moreover, the data structure does not require to be updated frequently, hence improving the computational cost. This feature is especially useful when applied to large reaction networks. We benchmark our method on biological reaction models to prove its applicability and efficiency.",17,[],10

1701.05809,q-bio,"Extreme climatic events have been shown to be strong drivers of tree growth, forest dynamics, and range contraction. Here we study the climatic drivers of Picea crassifolia Kom., an endemic to northwest China where climate has significantly warmed. Picea crassifolia was sampled from its lower distributional margin to its upper distributional margin on the Helan Mountains to test the hypothesis that 1) growth at the upper limit is limited by cool temperatures and 2) is limited by drought at its lower limit. We found that trees at the lower distributional margin have experienced a higher rate of stem-growth cessation events since 2001 compared to trees at other elevations. While all populations have a similar climatic sensitivity, stem-growth cessation events in trees at lower distributional margin appear to be driven by low precipitation in June as the monsoon begins to deliver moisture to the region. Evidence indicates that mid-summer (July) vapor pressure deficit (VPD) exacerbates the frequency of these events. These data and our analysis makes it evident that an increase in severity and frequency of drought early in the monsoon season could increase the frequency and severity of stem-growth cessation in Picea crassifolia trees at lower elevations. Increases in VPD and warming would likely exacerbate the growth stress of this species on Helan Mountain.

This allows a quick (few spikes) estimate of the match between inputs and the input history as encoded in the network structure.

Surprisingly, it was found that in both cases, the cells display behavior that is contradictory to the chemoattractant gradient established in the maze. In case of the sequence, the cells do not like to take the same path through the maze as their predecessor, when faced with a bifurcation. To the contrary, they tend to alternate - if a leading cell takes the shorter (steeper gradient) path, the cell following it chooses the longer (weaker gradient) path, and vice versa. Additionally, we found that when a mother cell divides, its two daughters go in opposite directions (even if it means migrating against the chemoattractant gradient and overcoming on-going cell traffic). Therefore, it is apparent that fibroblasts modify each other's directional decisions in a manner that is counter-intuitive to what is expected from classical chemotaxis theory. Consequently, accounting for these effects could lead to a better understanding of tissue generation in vivo, and result in more advanced engineered tissue products in vitro.",17,[],10
1703.03449,q-bio,"Natural protein sequences contain a record of their history. A common constraint in a given protein family is the ability to fold to specific structures, and it has been shown possible to infer the main native ensemble by analyzing covariations in extant sequences. Still, many natural proteins that fold into the same structural topology show different stabilization energies, and these are often related to their physiological behavior. We propose a description for the energetic variation given by sequence modifications in repeat proteins, systems for which the overall problem is simplified by their inherent symmetry. We explicitly account for single amino acid and pair-wise interactions and treat higher order correlations with a single term. We show that the resulting force field can be interpreted with structural detail. We trace the variations in the energetic scores of natural proteins and relate them to their experimental characterization. The resulting energetic force field allows the prediction of the folding free energy change for several mutants, and can be used to generate synthetic sequences that are statistically indistinguishable from the natural counterparts.",17,[],10
1702.05129,q-bio,"We study the population size time series of a Neotropical small mammal with the intent of detecting and modelling population regulation processes generated by density-dependent factors and their possible delayed effects. The application of analysis tools based on principles of statistical generality are nowadays a common practice for describing these phenomena, but, in general, they are more capable of generating clear diagnosis rather than granting valuable modelling. For this reason, in our approach, we detect the principal temporal structures on the bases of different correlation measures, and from these results we build an ad-hoc minimalist autoregressive model that incorporates the main drivers of the dynamics. Surprisingly our model is capable of reproducing very well the time patterns of the empirical series and, for the first time, clearly outlines the importance of the time of attaining sexual maturity as a central temporal scale for the dynamics of this species. In fact, an important advantage of this analysis scheme is that all the model parameters are directly biologically interpretable and potentially measurable, allowing a consistency check between model outputs and independent measurements.",17,[],10
1701.07823,q-bio,"We present a continuum model for the mechanical behavior of the skeletal muscle tissue when its functionality is reduced due to aging. The loss of ability of activating is typical of the geriatric syndrome called sarcopenia. The material is described by a hyperelastic, polyconvex, transverse isotropic strain energy function. The three material parameters appearing in the energy are fitted by least square optimization on experimental data, while incompressibility is assumed through a Lagrange multiplier representing the hydrostatic pressure. The activation of the muscle fibers, which is related to the contraction of the sarcomere, is modeled by the so called active strain approach. The loss of performance of an elder muscle is then obtained by lowering of some percentage the active part of the stress. The model is implemented numerically and the obtained results are discussed and graphically represented.",17,[],10
1701.05338,q-bio,"Current treatment strategy for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) mainly includes inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity, which has dramatically improved the prognosis of the disease but without cure. In addition some patients may become drug resistant. Thus there is still the need for other therapies to avoid resistance and if possible to cure the disease. Loss of p53 is known to play an important role in the disease progression of CML and causes drug resistance. Here I propose that in CML, inositol requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1 alpha) may cause abnormal degradation of p53 mRNA resulting in inhibition of apoptosis in leukemic clonal cells, which has not been elucidated before.

1710.02199,q-bio,"One of the crucial questions in neuroscience is how a rich functional repertoire of brain states relates to its underlying structural organization. How to study the associations between these structural and functional layers is an open problem that involves novel conceptual ways of tackling this question. We here propose an extension of the Connectivity Independent Component Analysis (connICA) framework, to identify joint structural-functional connectivity traits. Here, we extend connICA to integrate structural and functional connectomes by merging them into common hybrid connectivity patterns that represent the connectivity fingerprint of a subject. We test this extended approach on the 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project. The method is able to extract main independent structural-functional connectivity patterns from the entire cohort that are sensitive to the realization of different tasks. The hybrid connICA extracted two main task-sensitive hybrid traits. The first, encompassing the within and between connections of dorsal attentional and visual areas, as well as fronto-parietal circuits. The second, mainly encompassing the connectivity between visual, attentional, DMN and subcortical networks. Overall, these findings confirms the potential ofthe hybrid connICA for the compression of structural/functional connectomes into integrated patterns from a set of individual brain networks.",17,[],10
1708.03263,q-bio,"The ability to learn new tasks and generalize performance to others is one of the most remarkable characteristics of the human brain and of recent AI systems. The ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously is also a signature characteristic of large-scale parallel architectures, that is evident in the human brain, and has been exploited effectively more traditional, massively parallel computational architectures. Here, we show that these two characteristics are in tension, reflecting a fundamental tradeoff between interactive parallelism that supports learning and generalization, and independent parallelism that supports processing efficiency through concurrent multitasking. We formally show that, while the maximum number of tasks that can be performed simultaneously grows linearly with network size, under realistic scenarios (e.g. in an unpredictable environment), the expected number that can be performed concurrently grows radically sub-linearly with network size. Hence, even modest reliance on shared representation strictly constrains the number of tasks that can be performed simultaneously, implying profound consequences for the development of artificial intelligence that optimally manages the tradeoff between learning and processing, and for understanding the human brains remarkably puzzling mix of sequential and parallel capabilities.",17,[],10
1710.08405,q-bio,"Spindles are self-organized microtubule-based structures that segregate chromosomes during cell division. The mass of the spindle is controlled by the balance between microtubule turnover and nucleation. The mechanisms that control the spatial regulation of microtubule nucleation remain poorly understood. Previous work has found that microtubule nucleators bind to microtubules in the spindle, but it is unclear if this binding regulates the activity of those nucleators. Here we use a combination of experiments and mathematical modeling to investigate this issue. We measure the concentration of tubulin and microtubules in and around the spindle. We found a very sharp decay in microtubules at the spindle interface, which is inconsistent with the activity of microtubule nucleators being independent of their association with microtubules and consistent with a model in which microtubule nucleators are only active when bound to a microtubule. This strongly argues that the activity of microtubule nucleators is greatly enhanced when bound to microtubules. Thus, microtubule nucleators are both localized and activated by the microtubules they generate.",17,[],10
1705.10035,q-bio,"Atomic radii and charges are two major parameters used in implicit solvent electrostatics and energy calculations. The optimization problem for charges and radii is under-determined, leading to uncertainty in the values of these parameters and in the results of solvation energy calculations using these parameters. This paper presents a new method for quantifying this uncertainty in implicit solvation calculations of small molecules using surrogate models based on generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansions. There are relatively few atom types used to specify radii parameters in implicit solvation calculations; therefore, surrogate models for these low-dimensional spaces could be constructed using least-squares fitting. However, there are many more types of atomic charges; therefore, construction of surrogate models for the charge parameter space requires compressed sensing combined with an iterative rotation method to enhance problem sparsity. We demonstrate the application of the method by presenting results for the uncertainties in small molecule solvation energies based on these approaches. The method presented in this paper is a promising approach for efficiently quantifying uncertainty in a wide range of force field parameterization problems, including those beyond continuum solvation calculations.The intent of this study is to provide a way for developers of implicit solvent model parameter sets to understand the sensitivity of their target properties (solvation energy) on underlying choices for solute radius and charge parameters.",17,[],10
1709.01072,q-bio,"Short-scale interactions yield large-scale vegetation patterns that, in turn, shape ecosystem function across landscapes. Fairy circles, which are circular patches bare of vegetation within otherwise continuous landscapes, are characteristic features of semiarid grasslands. We report the occurrence of submarine fairy circle seascapes in seagrass meadows and propose a simple model that reproduces the diversity of seascapes observed in these ecosystems as emerging from plant interactions within the meadow. These seascapes include two extreme cases, a continuous meadow and a bare landscape, along with intermediate states that range from the occurrence of persistent but isolated fairy circles, or solitons, to seascapes with multiple fairy circles, banded vegetation, and ""leopard skin"" patterns consisting of bare seascapes patterns consisting of bare seascapes dotted with plant patches. The model predicts that these intermediate seascapes extending across kilometers emerge as a consequence of local demographic imbalances along with facilitative and competitive interactions among the plants with a characteristic spatial scale of 20 to 30 m, consistent with known drivers of seagrass performance. The model, which can be extended to clonal growth plants in other landscapes showing fairy rings, reveals that the different seascapes observed hold diagnostic power as to the proximity of seagrass meadows to extinction points that can be used to identify ecosystems at risks.",17,[],10

We study the nature of interictal spikes and early warnings of the transition predicted by this model. We further demonstrate that recurrent seizures emerge due to the interaction between two networks.",17,[],10
1712.07870,q-bio,"The metaphor of a potential epigenetic differentiation landscape broadly suggests that during differentiation a stem cell follows the steepest descending gradient toward a stable equilibrium state which represents the final cell type. It has been conjectured that there is an analogy to the concept of entropy in statistical mechanics. In this context, in the undifferentiated state the entropy would be large since fewer constraints exist on the gene expression programs of the cell. As differentiation progresses, gene expression programs become more and more constrained and thus the entropy would be expected to decrease. Such an entropy decrease would, in analogy to statistical mechanics, require some form of free energy to decrease accordingly. In order to assess these predictions, we compute the Shannon entropy for time-resolved single-cell gene expression data in two different experimental setups of haematopoietic differentiation. We find that the behaviour of this entropy measure is in contrast to these predictions. In particular, we find that the Shannon entropy is not a decreasing function of developmental pseudo-time but instead it increases toward the point of commitment before decreasing again. This behaviour is consistent with an increase in gene expression disorder observed in populations sampled at the point of commitment. Single cells in these populations exhibit different combinations of regulator activity that suggest the presence of multiple configurations of a potential differentiation network as a result of multiple entry points into the committed state.",17,[],10
1707.05739,q-bio,"Biofilms are communities of bacteria that exhibit a multitude of multiscale biomechanical behaviors. Recent experimental advances have lead to characterizations of these behaviors in terms of measurements of the viscoelastic moduli of biofilms grown in bioreactors and the fracture and fragmentation properties of biofilms. These properties are macroscale features of biofilms; however, a previous work by our group has shown that heterogeneous microscale features are critical in predicting biofilm rheology. In this paper we use tools from statistical physics to develop a generative statistical model of the positions of bacteria in biofilms. We show through simulation that the macroscopic mechanical properties of biofilms depend on the choice of microscale spatial model. Our key finding is that a biologically inspired model of the locations of bacteria in a biofilm is critical to the simulation of biofilms with realistic in silico mechanical properties and statistical characteristics.",17,[],10
1712.04000,q-bio,"Affinity maturation produces antibodies that bind antigens with high specificity by accumulating mutations in the antibody sequence. Mapping out the antibody-antigen affinity landscape can give us insight into the accessible paths during this rapid evolutionary process. By developing a carefully controlled null model for noninteracting mutations, we characterized epistasis in affinity measurements of a large library of antibody variants obtained by Tite-Seq, a recently introduced Deep Mutational Scan method yielding physical values of the binding constant. We show that representing affinity as the binding free energy minimizes epistasis. Yet, we find that epistatically interacting sites contribute substantially to binding. In addition to negative epistasis, we report a large amount of beneficial epistasis, enlarging the space of high-affinity antibodies as well as their mutational accessibility. These properties suggest that the degeneracy of antibody sequences that can bind a given antigen is enhanced by epistasis - an important property for vaccine design.",17,[],10

The second group, on the other hand, is characterized by very high transit cell division rates, of around one division per day. These groups do not have an embrionary origin. We argue that their properties arise from a combination of the needs of tissue homeostasis (in particular turnover rate) and a bound on cancer risk, which is roughly a linear function of the product Ns ms. The bound on cancer risk leads to a threshold at ms = 8/year, where the fraction of stem cells falls down two orders of magnitude.",17,[],10

After asymmetric cell division, the septum grows around the forespore in a process called engulfment, but the mechanism of force generation is unknown. Here, we derived a novel biophysical model for the dynamics of cell-wall remodeling during engulfment based on a balancing of dissipative, active, and mechanical forces. By plotting phase diagrams, we predict that sporulation is promoted by a line tension from the attachment of the septum to the outer cell wall, as well as by an imbalance in turgor pressures in the mother-cell and forespore compartments. We also predict that significant mother-cell growth hinders engulfment. Hence, relatively simple physical principles may guide this complex biological process.",17,[],10
1709.02309,q-bio,"Angiogenesis is a key phenomenon for tumour progression, diagnosis and treatment in brain tumours and more generally in oncology. Presently, its precise, direct quantitative assessment can only be done on whole tissue sections immunostained to reveal vascular endothelial cells. But this is a tremendous task for the pathologist and a challenge for the computer since digitised whole tissue sections, whole slide images (WSI), contain typically around ten gigapixels.   We define and implement an algorithm that determines automatically, on a WSI at objective magnification equation, the regions of tissue, the regions without blur and the regions of large puddles of red blood cells, and constructs the mask of blur-free, significant tissue on the WSI. Then it calibrates automatically the optical density ratios of the immunostaining of the vessel walls and of the counterstaining, performs a colour deconvolution inside the regions of blur-free tissue, and finds the vessel walls inside these regions by selecting, on the image resulting from the colour deconvolution, zones which satisfy a double-threshold criterion. A mask of vessel wall regions on the WSI is produced. The density of microvessels is finally computed as the fraction of the area of significant tissue which is occupied by vessel walls.   We apply this algorithm to a set of 186 WSI of paediatric brain tumours from World Health Organisation grades I to IV. The segmentations are of very good quality although the set of slides is very heterogeneous. The computation time is of the order of a fraction of an hour for each WSI on a modest computer. The computed microvascular density is found to be robust and strongly correlates with the tumour grade.   This method requires no training and can easily be applied to other tumour types and other stainings.",17,[],10

We show that flexibility and modularity are highly negatively correlated. However, we also demonstrate that flexibility and modularity make unique contributions to explain task performance, with modularity predicting performance for simple tasks and flexibility predicting performance on complex tasks that require cognitive control and executive functioning.

1710.05201,q-bio,"The balance between excitation and inhibition is crucial for neuronal computation. It is observed that the balanced state of neuronal networks exists in many experiments, yet its underlying mechanism remains to be fully clarified. Theoretical studies of the balanced state mainly focus on the analysis of the homogeneous Erdequations-R\'enyi network. However, neuronal networks have been found to be inhomogeneous in many cortical areas. In particular, the connectivity of neuronal networks can be of the type of scale-free, small-world, or even with specific motifs. In this work, we examine the questions of whether the balanced state is universal with respect to network topology and what characteristics the balanced state possesses in inhomogeneous networks such as scale-free and small-world networks. We discover that, for a sparsely but strongly connected inhomogeneous network, despite that the whole network receives external inputs, there is a small active subnetwork (active core) inherently embedded within it. The neurons in this active core have relatively high firing rates while the neurons in the rest of the network are quiescent. Surprisingly, the active core possesses a balanced state and this state is independent of the model of single-neuron dynamics. The dynamics of the active core can be well predicted using the Fokker-Planck equation with the mean-field assumption. Our results suggest that, in the presence of inhomogeneous network connectivity, the balanced state may be ubiquitous in the brain, and the network connectivity in the active core is essentially close to the Erdequations-R\'enyi structure. The existence of the small active core embedded in a large network may provide a potential dynamical scenario underlying sparse coding in neuronal networks.",17,[],10

Folklore alludes to such a relationship, but previous scientific analyses have failed to find significant associations. It has been shown that lunar cycles indeed have effects on animals; significant associations between human circadian rhythms and lunar cycles have also been reported. We set out to determine whether a significant statistical correlation exists between the lunar phase and sex determination during conception. We found that significant associations (\textitp-value equation) exist between the average sex ratio (male:female) and the lunar month. The likelihood of conception of a male is at its highest point five days after the full moon, whereas the highest likelihood of female conception occurs nineteen days after the full moon. Furthermore, we found that the strength of this influence is correlated with the amount of solar radiation (which is proportional to moonlight). Our results suggest that sex determination may be influenced by the moon cycle, which suggests the possibility of lunar influence on other biological phenomena.

1709.02145,q-bio,"Laboratory models are often used to understand the interaction of related pathogens via host immunity. For example, recent experiments where ferrets were exposed to two influenza strains within a short period of time have shown how the effects of cross-immunity vary with the time between exposures and the specific strains used. On the other hand, studies of the workings of different arms of the immune response, and their relative importance, typically use experiments involving a single infection. However, inferring the relative importance of different immune components from this type of data is challenging. Using simulations and mathematical modelling, here we investigate whether the sequential infection experiment design can be used not only to determine immune components contributing to cross-protection, but also to gain insight into the immune response during a single infection.   We show that virological data from sequential infection experiments can be used to accurately extract the timing and extent of cross-protection. Moreover, the broad immune components responsible for such cross-protection can be determined. Such data can also be used to infer the timing and strength of some immune components in controlling a primary infection, even in the absence of serological data. By contrast, single infection data cannot be used to reliably recover this information. Hence, sequential infection data enhances our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the control and resolution of infection, and generates new insight into how previous exposure influences the time course of a subsequent infection.",17,[],10

1708.04329,q-bio,"Motivation: Seed filtering is critical in DNA read mapping, a process where billions of DNA fragments (reads) sampled from a donor are mapped onto a reference genome to identify genomic variants of the donor. Read mappers 1) quickly generate possible mapping locations (i.e., seeds) for each read, 2) extract reference sequences at each of the mapping locations, and then 3) check similarity between each read and its associated reference sequences with a computationally expensive dynamic programming algorithm (alignment) to determine the origin of the read. Location filters come into play before alignment, discarding seed locations that alignment would have deemed a poor match. The ideal location filter would discard all poor matching locations prior to alignment such that there is no wasted computation on poor alignments.   Results: We propose a novel filtering algorithm, GRIM-Filter, optimized to exploit emerging 3D-stacked memory systems that integrate computation within a stacked logic layer, enabling processing-in-memory (PIM). GRIM-Filter quickly filters locations by 1) introducing a new representation of coarse-grained segments of the reference genome and 2) using massively-parallel in-memory operations to identify read presence within each coarse-grained segment. Our evaluations show that for 5% error acceptance rates, GRIM-Filter eliminates 5.59x-6.41x more false negatives and exhibits end-to-end speedups of 1.81x-3.65x compared to mappers employing the best previous filtering algorithm.",17,[],10
1711.03809,q-bio,"Brain areas' functional repertoires are shaped by their incoming and outgoing structural connections. In empirically measured networks, most connections are short, reflecting spatial and energetic constraints. Nonetheless, a small number of connections span long distances, consistent with the notion that the functionality of these connections must outweigh their cost. While the precise function of these long-distance connections is not known, the leading hypothesis is that they act to reduce the topological distance between brain areas and facilitate efficient interareal communication. However, this hypothesis implies a non-specificity of long-distance connections that we contend is unlikely. Instead, we propose that long-distance connections serve to diversify brain areas' inputs and outputs, thereby promoting complex dynamics. Through analysis of five interareal network datasets, we show that long-distance connections play only minor roles in reducing average interareal topological distance. In contrast, areas' long-distance and short-range neighbors exhibit marked differences in their connectivity profiles, suggesting that long-distance connections enhance dissimilarity between regional inputs and outputs. Next, we show that -- in isolation -- areas' long-distance connectivity profiles exhibit non-random levels of similarity, suggesting that the communication pathways formed by long connections exhibit redundancies that may serve to promote robustness. Finally, we use a linearization of Wilson-Cowan dynamics to simulate the covariance structure of neural activity and show that in the absence of long-distance connections, a common measure of functional diversity decreases. Collectively, our findings suggest that long-distance connections are necessary for supporting diverse and complex brain dynamics.",17,[],10

We compare the damage effects from different noise sources and determine the ""sweet spots"" in the driving parameter space.

1711.10498,quant-ph,"It is commonly expected that quantum theory is universal, in that it describes the world at all scales. Yet, quantum effects at the macroscopic scale continue to elude our experimental observation. This fact is commonly attributed to decoherence processes affecting systems of sufficiently large number of constituent subsystems leading to an effective macro-scale beyond which a quantum description of the whole system becomes superfluous. Here, we show both theoretically and experimentally that the existence of such a scale is unjustifiable from an information-theoretic perspective. We introduce a variant of the Wigner's friend experiment in which a multiparticle quantum system is observed by the friend. The friend undergoes rapid decoherence through her interactions with the environment. In the usual version of this thought experiment, decoherence removes the need for Wigner to treat her as a quantum system. However, for our variant we prove theoretically and observe experimentally that there exist partitions of the subsystems in which the friend is entangled with one of the particles in assistance with the other particle, as observed by Wigner. Importantly, we show that the friend is indispensable for the entanglement to be observed. Hence Wigner is compelled to treat the friend as part of a larger quantum system. By analyzing our scenario in the context of a quantum key distribution protocol, we show that a semi-classical description of the experiment is suboptimal for security analysis, highlighting the significance of the quantum description of the friend.",17,[],6

1705.03612,quant-ph,"Entangled two-mode Gaussian states are a key resource for quantum information technologies such as teleportation, quantum cryptography and quantum computation, so quantification of Gaussian entanglement is an important problem. Entanglement of formation is unanimously considered a proper measure of quantum correlations, but for arbitrary two-mode Gaussian states no analytical form is currently known. In contrast, logarithmic negativity is a measure straightforward to calculate and so has been adopted by most researchers, even though it is a less faithful quantifier. In this work, we derive an analytical lower bound for entanglement of formation of generic two-mode Gaussian states, which becomes tight for symmetric states and for states with balanced correlations. We define simple expressions for entanglement of formation in physically relevant situations and use these to illustrate the problematic behavior of logarithmic negativity, which can lead to spurious conclusions.",17,[],6
1707.08260,quant-ph,"In a conventional atomic interferometer employing equation atoms, the phase sensitivity is at the standard quantum limit: equation. Using spin-squeezing, the sensitivity can be increased, either by lowering the quantum noise or via phase amplification, or a combination thereof. Here, we show how to increase the sensitivity, to the Heisenberg limit of equation, while increasing the quantum noise by equation, thereby suppressing by the same factor the effect of excess noise. The protocol uses a Schrodinger Cat state representing a superposition of two collective states of equation atoms, behaving as a single entity with an equation-fold increase in Compton frequency. The resulting equation-fold phase magnification is revealed by using atomic state detection instead of collective state detection. We also show how to realize an atomic clock based on such a Schrodinger Cat state, with an equation-fold increase in the effective transition frequency. We discuss potential experimental constraints for implementing this scheme, using one axis twist squeezing employing the cavity feedback scheme, and show that the effects of cavity decay and spontaneous emission are highly suppressed. We find that the maximum improvement in sensitivity can be close to the ideal limit, for as many as ten million atoms.",17,[],6

Interestingly, this scaling has a limited duration, and we show that certain pulse sequences prolong the effect.

1706.09226,quant-ph,"The response of a quadrupolar nucleus (nuclear spin with I>1/2) to an oscillating radio-frequency (RF) pulse/field is delicately dependent on the ratio of the quadrupolar coupling constant to the amplitude of the pulse in addition to its duration and oscillating frequency. Consequently, analytic description of the excitation process in the density operator formalism has remained less transparent within existing theoretical frameworks. As an alternative, the utility of the ""concept of effective Floquet Hamiltonians"" is explored in the present study to explicate the nuances of the excitation process in multilevel systems. Employing spin I=3/2 as a case study, a unified theoretical framework for describing the excitation of multiple-quantum (MQ) transitions in static isotropic and anisotropic solids is proposed within the framework of perturbation theory. The challenges resulting from the anisotropic nature of the quadrupolar interactions are addressed within the effective Hamiltonian framework. The possible role of the various interaction frames on the convergence of the perturbation corrections is discussed along with a proposal for a ""hybrid method"" for describing the excitation process in anisotropic solids. Employing suitable model systems, the validity of the proposed hybrid method is substantiated through a rigorous comparison between simulations emerging from exact numerical and analytic methods.",17,[],6

More concretely, we describe the properties of the dynamics that arise from quantum mechanics if one has access only to a coarse-grained description of the system. We obtain that the effective maps are not necessarily of Kraus form, due to correlations between accessible and nonaccessible degrees of freedom, and that the distance between two effective states may increase under the action of the effective map.

Operationally, considering the projective measurement of the state in the computational basis, coherence quantifies the intrinsic randomness of the measurement outcome conditioned on all the other quantum systems. However, such a relation is only proven when randomness is characterized by the Von-Neumann entropy. In this work, we consider several recently proposed coherence measures and relate them to the general uncertainties of the projective measurement outcome conditioned on all the other systems. Our work thus provides a unified framework for redefining several coherence measures via general conditional entropies.

In that problem, we must decide if the lowest eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian is bounded below some value, or above another, promised one of these is true. Given the ground state of the Hamiltonian, a quantum computer can determine this question, even if the ground state itself may not be efficiently quantum preparable. Kitaev's proof of QMA-completeness encodes a unitary quantum circuit in QMA into the ground space of a Hamiltonian. However, we now have quantum computing models based on measurement instead of unitary evolution, furthermore we can use post-selected measurement as an additional computational tool. In this work, we generalise Kitaev's construction to allow for non-unitary evolution including post-selection. Furthermore, we consider a type of post-selection under which the construction is consistent, which we call tame post-selection. We consider the computational complexity consequences of this construction and then consider how the probability of an event upon which we are post-selecting affects the gap between the ground state energy and the energy of the first excited state of its corresponding Hamiltonian.

It is shown that this framework, including collapse of the wave function, can be simulated with classical resources without violating the locality principle. We present a local ontological model whose predictions are indistinguishable from the quantum case.

According to the Copenhagen interpretation, measurements affect the quantum system in such a way that the quantum superposition collapses after the measurement, erasing any knowledge of the prior state. We show here that counter to this view, unamplified measurements (measurements where all variables comprising a pointer are controllable) have coherent ancilla density matrices that encode the memory of the entire set of quantum measurements, and that the quantum chain of a set of consecutive unamplified measurements is non-Markovian. In contrast, sequences of amplified measurements (measurements where at least one pointer variable has been lost) are equivalent to a quantum Markov chain.

We demonstrate that there is a set of characteristic values of the coupling, for which the entanglement generated remains extremely high. We investigate the robustness of both protocols to diagonal and off-diagonal disorder. Our results demonstrate extremely strong robustness to both perturbation types, up to strength of 50% of the weak coupling.

For a general quantum circuit, the sum over paths contains an exponential number of terms, and no efficient classical algorithm is known that can compute the sum. For quopit Clifford circuits, however, we show that the sum over paths takes a special form: it can be expressed as a product of Weil sums with quadratic polynomials, which can be computed efficiently.

By applying our technique we link all three steering problems one-to-one with the incompatibility of quantum measurements, a result formerly known only for spatial steering. We exploit this connection by showing how measurement uncertainty relations can be used as tight steering inequalities for all three scenarios. Moreover, we show that certain notions of temporal and spatial steering are fully equivalent and prove a hierarchy between temporal steering and macrorealistic hidden variable models.",17,[],6
1708.03508,quant-ph,"Closed Timelike Curves are relativistically valid objects allowing time travel to the past. Treating them as computational objects opens the door to a wide range of results which cannot be achieved using non relativistic quantum mechanics. Recently, research in classical and quantum computation has focused on effectively harnessing the power of these curves. In particular, Brun (Found. Phys.

1708.04371,quant-ph,We investigate the realization of conditional displacement interaction in the transversal direction in ultrastrongly coupled circuit quantum electrodynamics by adjusting parameters of external magnetic fields. The special interaction is derived in the system of charge qubit(s) coupled to a LC resonator. We consolidate the implementation of quantum gates and the generation of superposed coherent states based on the transversal conditional displacement interaction numerically. The conditional displacement interaction in the ultrastrong coupling regime enhances quantum process to operate at the time scale of nanoseconds.,17,[],6

The asymptotic wave functions, approximate scattering phase shifts, normalization constants and bound state energy equations were obtained. The non-relativistic limits of the scattering phase shifts and the bound states energy equations for the three potentials were also obtained. Our bound states energy equations are in excellent agreement with the available ones in the literature.

1712.01557,quant-ph,"Before executing a quantum algorithm, one must first decompose the algorithm into machine-level instructions compatible with the architecture of the quantum computer, a process known as quantum compiling. There are many different quantum circuit decompositions for the same algorithm but it is desirable to compile leaner circuits. A fundamentally important cost metric is the equation count -- the number of equation gates in a circuit. For the single qubit case, optimal compiling is essentially a solved problem. However, multi-qubit compiling is a harder problem with optimal algorithms requiring classical runtime exponential in the number of qubits. Here, we present and compare several efficient quantum compilers for multi-qubit Clifford  equation circuits. We implemented our compilers in C and benchmarked them on random circuits, from which we determine that our TODD compiler yields the lowest equation counts on average. We also benchmarked TODD on a library of reversible logic circuits that appear in quantum algorithms and found that it reduced the equation count for 97\% of the circuits with an average equation-count saving of 20\% when compared against the best of all previous circuit decompositions.",17,[],6
1710.11326,quant-ph,"Spin states of maximal projection along some direction in space are called (spin) coherent, and are, in many aspects, the ""most classical"" available. For any spin equation, the spin coherent states form a 2-sphere in the projective Hilbert space equation of the system. We address several questions regarding that sphere, in particular its possible intersections with complex lines. We also find that, like Dali's iconic clocks, it extends in all possible directions in equation. We give a simple expression for the Majorana constellation of the linear combination of two coherent states, and use Mason's theorem to give a lower bound on the number of distinct stars of a linear combination of two arbitrary spin-equation states. Finally, we plot the image of the spin coherent sphere, assuming light in equation propagates along Fubini-Study geodesics. We argue that, apart from their intrinsic geometric interest, such questions translate into statements experimentalists might find useful.",17,[],6
1707.01837,quant-ph,"Understanding and characterizing phase transitions in driven-dissipative systems constitutes a new frontier for many-body physics. A generic feature of dissipative phase transitions is a vanishing gap in the Liouvillian spectrum, which leads to long-lived deviations from the steady-state as the system is driven towards the transition. Here, we show that photon correlation measurements can be used to characterize the corresponding critical slowing down of nonequilibrium dynamics. We focus on the extensively studied phenomenon of optical bistability in GaAs cavity-polaritons, which can be described as a first-order dissipative phase transition. Increasing the excitation strength towards the bistable range results in an increasing photon-bunching signal along with a decay time that is prolonged by more than nine orders of magnitude as compared to that of low density polaritons. In the limit of strong polariton interactions leading to pronounced quantum fluctuations, the mean-field bistability threshold is washed out. Nevertheless, the scaling of the Liouvillian gap closing as thermodynamic limit is approached provides a signature of the emerging dissipative phase transition. Our results establish photon correlation measurements as an invaluable tool for studying dynamical properties of dissipative phase transitions without requiring phase-sensitive interferometric measurements.",17,[],6
1705.03081,quant-ph,"We propose a mechanism of ground-state blockade between two equation-type Rydberg atoms in virtue of Rydberg-antiblockade effect and Raman transition. Inspired by the quantum Zeno effect, the strong Rydberg antiblockade interaction plays a role in frequently measuring one ground state of two, leading to a blockade effect for double occupation of the corresponding quantum state. By encoding the logic qubits into the ground states, we efficiently avoid the spontaneous emission of the excited Rydberg state, and maintain the nonlinear Rydberg-Rydberg interaction at the same time. As applications, we discuss in detail the feasibility of preparing two-atom and three-atom entanglement with ground-state blockade in closed system and open system, respectively, which shows that a high fidelity of entangled state can be obtained with current experimental parameters.",17,[],6
1710.06126,quant-ph,Bell's theorem cannot be proved if complementary measurements have to be represented by random variables which cannot be added or multiplied. One such case occurs if their domains are not identical. The case more directly related to the Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky argument occurs if there exists an `element of reality' but nevertheless addition of complementary results is impossible because they are represented by elements from different arithmetics. A naive mixing of arithmetics leads to contradictions at a much more elementary level than the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality.,17,[],6
1708.02886,quant-ph,"Superconducting circuits rank among the most interesting architectures for the implementation of quantum information processing devices. The recently proposed 0-equation qubit [Brooks et al., Phys. Rev. A equation, 52306 (2013)] promises increased protection from spontaneous relaxation and dephasing. In practice, this ideal behavior is only realized if the parameter dispersion among nominally identical circuit elements vanishes. In this paper we present a theoretical study of the more realistic scenario of slight variations in circuit elements. We discuss how the coupling to a spurious, low-energy mode affects the coherence properties of the 0-equation device, investigate the relevant decoherence channels, and present estimates for achievable coherence times in multiple parameter regimes.",17,[],6
1706.04684,quant-ph,"A set of Hamiltonians that are not self-adjoint but have the spectrum of the harmonic oscillator is studied. The eigenvectors of these operators and those of their Hermitian conjugates form a bi-orthogonal system that provides a mathematical procedure to satisfy the superposition principle. In this form the non-Hermitian oscillators can be studied in much the same way as in the Hermitian approaches. Two different nonlinear algebras generated by properly constructed ladder operators are found and the corresponding generalized coherent states are obtained. The non-Hermitian oscillators can be steered to the conventional one by the appropriate selection of parameters. In such limit, the generators of the nonlinear algebras converge to generalized ladder operators that would represent either intensity-dependent interactions or multi-photon processes if the oscillator is associated with single mode photon fields in nonlinear media.",17,[],6
1704.01348,quant-ph,"Quantum information science addresses how the processing and transmission of information are affected by uniquely quantum mechanical phenomena. Combination of two-qubit gates has been used to realize quantum circuits, however, scalability is becoming a critical problem. The use of three-qubit gates may simplify the structure of quantum circuits dramatically. Among them, the controlled-SWAP (Fredkin) gates are essential since they can be directly applied to important protocols, e.g., error correction, fingerprinting, and optimal cloning. Here we report a realization of the Fredkin gate for photonic qubits. We achieve a fidelity of 0.85 in the computational basis and an output state fidelity of 0.81 for a 3-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. The estimated process fidelity of 0.77 indicates that our Fredkin gate can be applied to various quantum tasks.",17,[],6

We experimentally characterize the Kennedy receiver in vacuum-single photon two-dimensional space using quantum detector tomography and evaluate the achievable discrimination error probability from the reconstructed measurement operators. We furthermore derive the minimum error rate obtainable with Gaussian transformations and homodyne detection. Our proof of principle experiment shows that the Kennedy receiver can achieve a discrimination error surpassing homodyne detection.",17,[],6
1703.09797,quant-ph,"We investigated the estimation of an unknown Gaussian process (containing displacement, squeezing and phase-shift) applied to a matter system. The state of the matter system is not directly measured; instead, we measure an optical mode which interacts with the system. We propose an interferometric setup exploiting a beam-splitter-type of light-matter interaction with homodyne detectors and two methods of estimation. We demonstrate the superiority of the interferometric setup over alternative non-interferometric schemes. Importantly, we show that even limited coupling strength and a noisy matter system are sufficient for very good estimation.

1706.06939,quant-ph,"In the typical model, a discrete-time coined quantum walk searching the 2D grid for a marked vertex achieves a success probability of equation in equation steps, which with amplitude amplification yields an overall runtime of equation. We show that making the quantum walk lackadaisical or lazy by adding a self-loop of weight equation to each vertex speeds up the search, causing the success probability to reach a constant near equation in equation steps, thus yielding an equation improvement over the typical, loopless algorithm. This improved runtime matches the best known quantum algorithms for this search problem. Our results are based on numerical simulations since the algorithm is not an instance of the abstract search algorithm.",17,[],6

1702.05323,quant-ph,"We consider the dynamics of a collisional model in which both the system and environment are embodied by spin-equation particles. In order to include non-Markovian features in our model we introduce interactions among the environmental qubits and investigate the effect that different models of such interaction have on the degree of non-Markovianity of the system's dynamics. By extending that interaction beyond the nearest-neighbour, we enhance the degree of non-Markovianity in the system's dynamics. A further significant increase can be observed if a collective interaction with the forthcoming environmental qubits is considered. However, the observed degree of non-Markovianity in this case is non-monotonic with the increasing number of qubits included in the interaction. Moreover, one can establish a connection between the degree of non-Markovianity in the evolution of the system and the fading behaviour of quantum coherence in its state as the number of collisions grow. We complement our study with an investigation on system-environment correlations and present an example of their importance on a physical upper bound on the trace distance derivative.",17,[],6
1710.04311,quant-ph,"In our work we consider the following problem in the context of teleportation: an unknown pure state have to be teleported and there are two laboratories which can perform the task. One laboratory uses a pure non maximally entangled channel but has a capability of performing the joint measurement on bases with a constrained degree of entanglement; the other lab makes use of a mixed X-state channel but can perform a joint measurement on bases with higher entanglement degrees. We compare the average teleportation fidelity achieved in both cases, finding that the fidelity achieved with the X-state can surpass the obtained with a pure channel, even though the X-state is less entangled than the latter. We find the conditions under which this effect occurs. Our results evidence that the entanglement of the joint measurement plays a role as important as the entanglement of the channel in order to optimize the teleportation process. We include an example showing that the average fidelity of teleportation obtained with a Werner state channel can be grater than that obtained with a Bell state channel.",17,[],6

The Bell theorem and the successive experiments ruled out the possibility of explaining quantum correlations using only local hidden variables models. Some authors suggested that quantum correlations could be due to superluminal communications that propagate isotropically with velocity \emphequation in a preferred reference frame. For finite values of \emphequation and in some special cases, Quantum Mechanics and superluminal models lead to different predictions. So far, no deviations from the predictions of Quantum Mechanics have been detected and only lower bounds for the superluminal velocities \emphequation have been established. Here we describe a new experiment that increases the maximum detectable superluminal velocities and we give some preliminary results.",17,[],6

In addition, we adapt our protocol to cases where the underlying error correction strategy chooses the optimal correction amongst all Clifford gates instead of the usual Pauli gates. The resulting Clifford frame protocol is of independent interest as it can increase error thresholds and could find applications in other areas of quantum computation.",17,[],6

1705.08023,quant-ph,"One of the most widely known building blocks of modern physics is Heisenberg's indeterminacy principle. Among the different statements of this fundamental property of the full quantum mechanical nature of physical reality, the uncertainty relation for energy and time has a special place.

In its modern formulation, the uncertainty relation is understood as setting a fundamental bound on how fast any quantum system can evolve. In this Topical Review we describe important milestones, such as the Mandelstam-Tamm and the Margolus-Levitin bounds on the quantum speed limit, and summarise recent applications in a variety of current research fields -- including quantum information theory, quantum computing, and quantum thermodynamics amongst several others. To bring order and to provide an access point into the many different notions and concepts, we have grouped the various approaches into the minimal time approach and the geometric approach, where the former relies on quantum control theory, and the latter arises from measuring the distinguishability of quantum states.

1708.07663,quant-ph,"The study of correlations with no definite causal order has revealed a rich structure emerging when more than two parties are involved. This motivates the consideration of multipartite ""noncausal"" correlations that cannot be realised even if noncausal resources are made available to a smaller number of parties. Here we formalise this notion: genuinely N-partite noncausal correlations are those that cannot be produced by grouping N parties into two or more subsets, where a causal order between the subsets exists. We prove that such correlations can be characterised as lying outside a polytope, whose vertices correspond to deterministic strategies and whose facets define what we call ""2-causal"" inequalities. We show that genuinely multipartite noncausal correlations arise within the process matrix formalism, where quantum mechanics holds locally but no global causal structure is assumed, although for some inequalities no violation was found. We further introduce two refined definitions that allow one to quantify, in different ways, to what extent noncausal correlations correspond to a genuinely multipartite resource.",17,[],6

We give an example in which the transition matrix elements that make the projector weak values vanish are the same ones that suppress detector clicks in strong measurements.

We calculate precision bounds for estimating the gradient of the magnetic field based on the quantum Fisher information. For quantum states that are invariant under homogeneous magnetic fields, we need to measure a single observable to estimate the gradient. On the other hand, for states that are sensitive to homogeneous fields, a simultaneous measurement is needed, as the homogeneous field must also be estimated. We prove that for the cases studied in this paper, such a measurement is feasible. We present a method to calculate precision bounds for gradient estimation with a chain of atoms or with two spatially separated atomic ensembles. We also consider a single atomic ensemble with an arbitrary density profile, where the atoms cannot be addressed individually, and which is a very relevant case for experiments. Our model can take into account even correlations between particle positions. While in most of the discussion we consider an ensemble of localized particles that are classical with respect to their spatial degree of freedom, we also discuss the case of gradient metrology with a single Bose-Einstein condensate.",17,[],6
