1104.2850,astro-ph,"Some observations of galaxies, and in particular dwarf galaxies, indicate a presence of cored density profiles in apparent contradiction with cusp profiles predicted by dark matter N-body simulations. We constructed an analytical model, using particle distribution functions (DFs), to show how a supernova (SN) explosion can transform a cusp density profile in a small-mass dark matter halo into a cored one. Considering the fact that a SN efficiently removes matter from the centre of the first haloes, we study the effect of mass removal through a SN perturbation in the DFs. We found that the transformation from a cusp into a cored profile is present even for changes as small as 0.5% of the total energy of the halo, that can be produced by the expulsion of matter caused by a single SN explosion.",11,[],1
1107.2815,astro-ph,"We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the members of three previously cataloged compact group (CG) candidates at redshifts z>0.3. These confirm spectroscopic redshifts compatible with being gravitationally bound structures at redshifts 0.3112, 0.3848 and 0.3643 respectively, and then they are the most distant CGs known with spectroscopic confirmation for all their members. The morphological and spectroscopic properties of all their galaxies indicate early types dominated by an old population of stars, with little star formation or nuclear activity. Most of the physical properties derived for the three groups are quite similar to the average properties of CGs at lower redshifts. In particular, from the velocities and positions of the respective members of each CG, we estimate short dynamic times. These leave open the questions of identifying the mechanism for forming CGs continuously and the nature of the final stages of these structures.",11,[],1
1110.6484,astro-ph,We present centimeter-band total flux density and linear polarization light curves illustrating the signature of shocks during radio band outbursts associated in time with gamma-ray flares detected by the Fermi LAT. The general characteristics of the spectral evolution during these events is well-explained by new radiative transfer simulations incorporating propagating oblique shocks and assuming an initially turbulent magnetic field. This finding supports the idea that oblique shocks in the jet are a viable explanation for activity from the radio to the gamma-ray band in at least some gamma-ray flares.,11,[],1
1105.4816,astro-ph,"Lunar occultations (LO) provide a unique combination of high angular resolution and sensitivity at near-infrared wavelenghts. At the ESO Very Large Telescope, it is possible to achieve about 1 milliarcsecond (mas) resolution and detect sources as faint as Kequation12\,mag.   We have taken advantage of a passage of the Moon over two crowded and reddened regions in the direction of the inner part of the galactic bulge, in order to obtain a high number of occultation light curves over two half nights. Our goal was to detect and characterize new binary systems, and to investigate highly extincted and relatively unknown infrared sources in search of circumstellar shells and similar peculiarities. Our target list included a significant number of very late-type stars, but in fact the majority of the sources was without spectral classification.   A LO event requires the sampling of the light curve at millisecond rates in order to permit a detailed study of the diffraction fringes. For this, we used the so-called burst mode of the ISAAC instrument at the Melipal telescope. Our observing efficiency was ultimately limited by overheads for telescope pointing and data storage, to about one event every three minutes.   We could record useful light curves for 184 sources. Of these, 24 were found to be binaries or multiples, all previously unknown. The projected separations are as small as 7.5\,mas, and the magnitude differences as high as equationK=6.5\,mag. Additionally we could establish, also for the first time, the resolved nature of at least two more stars, with indication of circumstellar emission. We could also put upper limits on the angular size of about 165 unresolved stars, an information that combined with previous and future observations will be very helpful in establishing a list of reliable calibrators for long baseline interferometers.",11,[],1
1110.1644,astro-ph,"An important class of formation theories for hot Jupiters involves the excitation of extreme orbital eccentricity (e=0.99 or even larger) followed by tidal dissipation at periastron passage that eventually circularizes the planetary orbit at a period less than 10 days. In a steady state, this mechanism requires the existence of a significant population of super-eccentric (e>0.9) migrating Jupiters with long orbital periods and periastron distances of only a few stellar radii. For these super-eccentric planets, the periastron is fixed due to conservation of orbital angular momentum and the energy dissipated per orbit is constant, implying that the rate of change in semi-major axis a is \dot a \propto a0.5 and consequently the number distribution satisfies dN/dlog a\propto a0.5. If this formation process produces most hot Jupiters, Kepler should detect several super-eccentric migrating progenitors of hot Jupiters, allowing for a test of high-eccentricity migration scenarios.",11,[],1
1110.0773,astro-ph,"Context: Ground-state OH maser emission from late-type stars is usually polarized and remains a powerful probe of the magnetic field structure in the outer regions of circumstellar envelopes if observed with high angular and spectral resolutions. Observations in all four Stokes parameters are quite sparse and this is the most thorough, systematic study published to date.   Aims: We aim to determine polarization properties of OH masers in an extensive sample of stars that show copious mass loss and search for candidate objects that are well-suited for high angular resolution studies.   Methods: Full-polarization observations of the OH 1612 and 1667 MHz maser transitions were carried out for a sample of 117 AGB and post-AGB stars. Several targets were also observed in the 1665 MHz line.   Results: Polarized features occur in more than 75% of the sources in the complete sample and there is no intrinsic difference in the occurrence of polarized emission between the three classes of objects of different infrared characteristics. The highest fractional polarization occurs for the post-AGBPN and the MiraSR classes at 1612 and 1667 MHz, respectively. Differences in the fractional polarization between the sources at different evolutionary stages appear to be related to depolarization caused by blending. The alignment of the polarization angles at the extreme sides of the shell implies a regular structure of the magnetic field of a strength of 0.3-2.3 mG.   Conclusions: Polarized OH maser features are widespread in AGB and post-AGB stars. The relationship between the circular and linear fractional polarizations for a representative sample are consistent with the standard models of polarization for the Zeeman splitting higher than the Doppler line width, whereas the polarized features are the sigma components.",11,[],1
1106.5363,astro-ph,"We aim at a highly sensitive search for weak magnetic fields in main sequence stars of intermediate mass, by scanning classes of stars with no previously reported magnetic members. After detecting a weak magnetic field on the normal, rapidly rotating A-type star Vega, we concentrate here on the bright star Sirius A, taken as a prototypical, chemically peculiar, moderately rotating Am star. We employed the NARVAL and ESPaDOnS high-resolution spectropolarimeters to collect 442 circularly polarized spectra, complemented by 60 linearly polarized spectra. Using a list of about 1,100 photospheric spectral lines, we computed a cross correlation line profile from every spectrum, leading to a signal-to-noise ratio of up to 30,000 in the polarized profile. We report the repeated detection of circularly polarized, highly asymmetric signatures in the line profiles, interpreted as Zeeman signatures of a large-scale photospheric magnetic field, with a line-of-sight component equal to equation G. This is the first polarimetric detection of a surface magnetic field on an Am star. Using rough estimates of the physical properties of the upper layers of Sirius A, we suggest that a dynamo operating in the shallow convective envelope cannot account for the field strength reported here. Together with the magnetic field of Vega, this result confirms that a new class of magnetic objects exists among non Ap/Bp intermediate-mass stars, and it may indicate that a significant fraction of tepid stars are magnetic.",11,[],1
1107.5155,astro-ph,"[Abridged] Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies are a class of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that have all the properties of type 1 Seyfert galaxies but show peculiar characteristics, including the narrowest Balmer lines, strongest Fe II emission, and extreme properties in the X-rays. Line and continuum radio observations provide an optimal tool to access the (often) optically obscured innermost regions of AGN and reveal the kinematics of the gas around their central engines. We investigate the interplay between the peculiar NLS1 class of AGN and the maser phenomenon, to help us understand the nature of the maser emission in some NLS1s where water maser emission has been detected. We observed a sample of NLS1 galaxies with the Green Bank Telescope in a search for water maser emission at 22 GHz. We also reduced and analysed archival Green Bank Telescope and Very Large Array data and produced 22-GHz spectra for the five NLS1 galaxies with detected maser emission. In particular, we imaged the maser and nuclear radio continuum of NGC5506 at subarcsec scales with the Very Large Array. We discovered maser emission in two NLS1 galaxies: IGRJ16385-2057, and IRAS034500055. In addition to the three previously known maser detections in the NLS1s Mrk766, NGC4051, and NGC5506, this yields a water maser detection rate in NLS1 galaxies of ~7% (5/71). This value rises significantly to ~21% (5/24) when considering only NLS1 galaxies at recessional velocities less than 10000 km/s. For NGC4051 and NGC5506, we find that the water maser emission is located within 5 and 12 pc, respectively, of nuclear radio continuum knots, which are interpreted as core-jet structures.",11,[],1
1112.0609,astro-ph,"A quantitative study of the observable radio signatures of the sausage, kink, and torsional MHD oscillation modes in flaring coronal loops is performed. Considering first non-zero order effect of these various MHD oscillation modes on the radio source parameters such as magnetic field, line of sight, plasma density and temperature, electron distribution function, and the source dimensions, we compute time dependent radio emission (spectra and light curves). The radio light curves (of both flux density and degree of polarization) at all considered radio frequencies are than quantified in both time domain (via computation of the full modulation amplitude as a function of frequency) and in Fourier domain (oscillation spectra, phases, and partial modulation amplitude) to form the signatures specific to a particular oscillation mode and/or source parameter regime. We found that the parameter regime and the involved MHD mode can indeed be distinguished using the quantitative measures derived in the modeling. We apply the developed approach to analyze radio burst recorded by Owens Valley Solar Array and report possible detection of the sausage mode oscillation in one (partly occulted) flare and kink or torsional oscillations in another flare.",11,[],1
1109.2031,astro-ph,"This article combines new CCD polarimetric data with previous information about protostellar objects in a search for correlations involving the interstellar magnetic field. Specifically, we carried out an optical polarimetric study of a sample of 28 fields of 10 X 10 arcmin2 located in the neighborhood of protostellar jets and randomly spread over the Galaxy. The polarimetry of a large number of field stars is used to estimate both the average and dispersion of the interstellar magnetic field (ISMF) direction in each region. The results of the applied statistical tests are as follows. Concerning the alignment between the jet direction and the interstellar magnetic field, the whole sample does not show alignment. There is, however, a statistically significant alignment for objects of Classes 0 and I. Regarding the interstellar magnetic field dispersion, our sample presents values slightly larger for regions containing T Tauri objects than for those harboring younger protostars. Moreover the ISMF dispersion in regions containing high-mass objects tends to be larger than in those including only low-mass protostars. In our sample, the mean interstellar polarization as a function of the average interstellar extinction in a region reaches a maximum value around 3% for A(V) = 5, after which it decreases. Our data also show a clear correlation of the mean value of the interstellar polarization with the dispersion of the interstellar magnetic field: the larger the dispersion, the smaller the polarization. Based on a comparison of our and previous results, we suggest that the dispersion in regions forming stars is larger than in quiescent regions.",11,[],1
1110.0690,astro-ph,"In order to find the most extreme dust-hidden high-redshift galaxies, we select 196 extremely red objects in the Ks and IRAC bands (KIEROs, [Ks-4.5um](AB)>1.6) in the 0.06 deg2 GOODS-N region. This selection avoids the Balmer breaks of galactic spectra at z<4 and picks up red galaxies with strong dust extinction. The photometric redshifts of KIEROs are between 1.5 and 5, with ~70% at z~2-4. KIEROs are very massive, with M*~1010-1012 Msun. They are optically faint and usually cannot be picked out by the Lyman break selection. On the other hand, the KIERO selection includes approximately half of the known millimeter and submillimeter galaxies in the GOODS-N. Stacking analyses in the radio, millimeter, and submillimeter all show that KIEROs are much more luminous than average 4.5um selected galaxies. Interestingly, the stacked fluxes for ACS-undetected KIEROs in these wavebands are 2.5-5 times larger than those for ACS-detected KIEROs. With the stacked radio fluxes and the local radio-FIR correlation, we derive mean infrared luminosities of 2-7x1012 Lsun and mean star formation rates of 300-1200 Msun/yr for KIEROs with redshifts. We do not find evidence of a significant subpopulation of passive KIEROs. The large stellar masses and star formation rates imply that KIEROs are equation massive galaxies in rapid formation. Our results show that a large sample of dusty ultraluminous sources can be selected in this way and that a large fraction of high-redshift star formation is hidden by dust.",11,[],1
1109.3470,astro-ph,"According to one version of the recently proposed ""manifold"" theory that explains the origin of spirals and rings in relation to chaotic orbits, galaxies with stronger bars should have a higher spiral arms pitch angle when compared to galaxies with weaker bars. A sub-sample of barred-spiral galaxies in the Ohio State University Bright Galaxy Survey, was used to analyze the spiral arms pitch angle. These were compared with bar strengths taken from the literature. It was found that the galaxies in which the spiral arms maintain a logarithmic shape for more than 70equation seem to corroborate the predicted trend.",11,[],1
1104.1618,astro-ph,"It is widely accepted that individual Galactic globular clusters harbor two coeval generations of stars, the first one born with the `standard' equation-enhanced metal mixture observed in field Halo objects, the second one characterized by an anticorrelated CN-ONa abundance pattern overimposed on the first generation, equation-enhanced metal mixture. We have investigated with appropriate stellar population synthesis models how this second generation of stars affects the integrated spectrum of a typical metal rich Galactic globular cluster, like 47\,Tuc, focusing our analysis on the widely used Lick-type indices. We find that the only indices appreciably affected by the abundance anticorrelations are Ca4227, G4300, equation, equation and NaD. The age-sensitive Balmer line, Fe line and the [MgFe] indices widely used to determine age, Fe and total metallicity of extragalactic systems are largely insensitive to the second generation population. Enhanced He in second generation stars affects also the Balmer line indices of the integrated spectra, through the change of the turn off temperature and -- in the assumption that the mass loss history of both stellar generations is the same -- the horizontal branch morphology of the underlying isochrones.",11,[],1
1105.3924,astro-ph,"We present Herschel-SPIRE Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) and radio follow-up observations of two Herschel-ATLAS (H-ATLAS) detected strongly lensed distant galaxies. In one of the targeted galaxies H-ATLAS J090311.6003906 (SDP.81) we detect [OIII] 88letterm and [CII] 158letterm lines at a signal-to-noise ratio of ~5. We do not have any positive line identification in the other fainter target H-ATLAS J091305.0-005343 (SDP.130). Currently SDP.81 is the faintest sub-mm galaxy with positive line detections with the FTS, with continuum flux just below 200 mJy in the 200-600 letterm wavelength range. The derived redshift of SDP.81 from the two detections is z=3.043 /-0.012, in agreement with ground-based CO measurements. This is the first detection by Herschel of the [OIII] 88letterm line in a galaxy at redshift higher than 0.05. Comparing the observed lines and line ratios with a grid of photo-dissociation region (PDR) models with different physical conditions, we derive the PDR cloud density n ~ 2000 cm-3 and the far-UV ionizing radiation field G0 ~ 200 (in units of the Habing field -- the local Galactic interstellar radiation field of 1.6x10-6 W/m2). Using the CO derived molecular mass and the PDR properties we estimate the effective radius of the emitting region to be 500-700 pc. These characteristics are typical for star-forming, high redshift galaxies. The radio observations indicate that SDP.81 deviates significantly from the local FIR/radio correlation, which hints that some fraction of the radio emission is coming from an AGN. The constraints on the source size from millimiter-wave observations put a very conservative upper limit of the possible AGN contribution to less than 33%. These indications, together with the high [OIII]/FIR ratio and the upper limit of [OI] 63letterm/[CII] 158letterm suggest that some fraction of the ionizing radiation is likely to originate from an AGN.",11,[],1
1103.2603,astro-ph,"We report the discovery of a new transiting planet in the Southern Hemisphere. It has been found by the WASP-south transit survey and confirmed photometrically and spectroscopically by the 1.2m Swiss Euler telescope, LCOGT 2m Faulkes South Telescope, the 60 cm TRAPPIST telescope and the ESO 3.6m telescope. The orbital period of the planet is 2.94 days. We find it is a gas giant with a mass of 0.88  0.10 Mj and a radius estimated at 0.96  0.05 Rj . We have also obtained spectra during transit with the HARPS spectrograph and detect the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect despite its small amplitude. Because of the low signal to noise of the effect and of a small impact parameter we cannot place a constraint on the projected spin-orbit angle. We find two confiicting values for the stellar rotation. Our determination, via spectral line broadening gives v sin I = 2.2  0.3 km/s, while another method, based on the activity level using the index log R'HK, gives an equatorial rotation velocity of only v = 1.35  0.20 km/s. Using these as priors in our analysis, the planet could either be misaligned or aligned. This should send strong warnings regarding the use of such priors. There is no evidence for eccentricity nor of any radial velocity drift with time.",11,[],1
1108.5354,astro-ph,"We investigate the statistics of the cosmic microwave background using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We show that, when we correctly de-correlate the data, the partition function of the Kolmogorov stochasticity parameter is compatible with the Kolmogorov distribution and, contrary to previous claims, the CMB data are compatible with Gaussian fluctuations with the correlation function given by standard Lambda-CDM. We then use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to derive upper bounds on residual point source power in the CMB, and indicate the promise of this statistics for further datasets, especially Planck, to search for deviations from Gaussianity and for detecting point sources and Galactic foregrounds.",11,[],1
1112.2757,astro-ph,"We present models for the slow neutron-capture process (s process) in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of metallicity [Fe/H]=-2.3 and masses 0.9 Msun to 6 Msun. We encountered different regimes of neutron-capture nucleosynthesis increasing in importance as the stellar mass decreases: the 22Ne(alpha,n)25Mg reaction activated during the thermal pulses, the 13C(alpha,n)16O reaction activated in radiative conditions during the interpulse periods, and the 13C(alpha,n)16O reaction activated during the thermal pulses, also as a result of mild proton ingestion episodes. The models where the 13C burns radiatively (masses ~ 2 Msun) produce an overall good match to carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars showing s-process enhancements (CEMP-s), except they produce too much Na and F. On the other hand, none of our models can provide a match to the composition of CEMP stars also showing rapid-process enhancements (CEMP-s/r). The models fail to reproduce the observed Eu abundances, and they also fail to reproduce the correlation between the Eu and Ba abundances. They also cannot match the ratio of heavy to light s-process elements observed in many CEMP-s/r stars, which can be more than ten times higher than in the solar system. To explain the composition of CEMP-s/r stars we need to invoke the existence of a different ""s/r"" neutron-capture process either with features in-between the s and the r processes, or generated by superpositions of different neutron-capture processes in the same astrophysical site or in sites linked to each other - for example, in multiple stellar systems.",11,[],1
1111.0350,astro-ph,"The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has made the first definitive GeV detections of the binaries LS I 61\circ303 and LS5039 in the first year after its launch in August 2008. These detections were unambiguous because, apart from a reduced positional uncertainty, the gamma-ray emission in each case was orbitally modulated with the corresponding orbital period. The LAT results posed new questions about the nature of these objects, after the unexpected observation of an exponential cutoff in the GeV gamma-ray spectra of both LS I 61\circ303 and LS5039, at least along part of their orbital motion. We present here the analysis of new data from the LAT, comprising 2.5 years of observations through which LS I 61\circ303 continues to provide some surprises. We find an increase in flux in March 2009 and a steady decrease in the flux fraction modulation. The LAT now detects emission up to 30 GeV, where prior datasets led to upper limits only. At the same time, contemporaneous TeV observations either no longer detected the source, or found it -at least in some orbits- close to periastron, far from the usual phases in which the source usually appeared at TeV energies. The on-source exposure of LS 5039 has also drastically increased along the last years, and whilst our analysis shows no new behavior in comparison with our earlier report, the higher statistics of the current dataset allows for a deeper investigation of its orbital and spectral evolution.",11,[],1
1112.1237,astro-ph,"A central quantity in mean-field magnetohydrodynamics is the mean electromotive force EMF, which in general depends on the mean magnetic field. It may however have a part independent of the mean magnetic field. Here we study an example of a rotating conducting body of turbulent fluid with non-zero cross-helicity, in which a contribution to the EMF proportional to the angular velocity occurs (Yoshizawa 1990). If the forcing is helical, it also leads to an alpha effect, and large-scale magnetic fields can be generated. For not too rapid rotation, the field configuration is such that Yoshizawa's contribution to the EMF is considerably reduced compared to the case without alpha effect. In that case, large-scale flows are also found to be generated.",11,[],1
1108.5925,astro-ph,"New visible and K-band polarization measurements on stars surrounding molecular clouds in Orion A and stars in the BN vicinity are presented. Our results confirm that magnetic fields located inside the Orion A molecular clouds and in their close neighborhood are spatially connected. On and around the BN object, we measured the angular offsets between the K-band polarization data and available submm data. We find high values of the polarization degree, PK, and of the optical depth, letterK, close to an angular offset position of 90\circ whereas lower values of PK and letterK are observed for smaller angular offsets. We interpret these results as evidence for the presence of various magnetic field components toward lines of sight in the vicinity of BN. On a larger scale, we measured the distribution of angular offsets between available H-band polarization data and the same submm data set. Here we find an increase of <PH> with angular offset which we interpret as a rotation of the magnetic field by \lesssim 60\circ. This trend generalizes previous results on small scale toward and around lines of sight to BN and is consistent with a twist of the magnetic field on a larger scale towards OMC-1. A comparison of our results with several other studies suggests that a two-component magnetic field, maybe helical, could be wrapping the OMC-1 filament.",11,[],1
1109.0953,astro-ph,"We present a detailed analysis from new multi-wavelength observations of the exceptional galaxy cluster ACT-CL J0102-4915 ""El Gordo,"" likely the most massive, hottest, most X-ray luminous and brightest Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect cluster known at z>0.6. The Atacama Cosmology Telescope collaboration discovered El Gordo as the most significant SZ decrement in a sky survey area of 755 deg2. Our VLT/FORS2 spectra of 89 member galaxies yield a cluster redshift, z=0.870, and velocity dispersion, s=1321/-106 km/s. Our Chandra observations reveal a hot and X-ray luminous system with an integrated temperature of Tx=14.5/-1.0 keV and 0.5-2.0 keV band luminosity of Lx=(2.19/-0.11)x1045 h70-2 erg/s. We obtain several statistically consistent cluster mass estimates; using mass scaling relations with velocity dispersion, X-ray Yx, and integrated SZ, we estimate a cluster mass of M200a=(2.16/-0.32)x1015 Msun/h70. The Chandra and VLT/FORS2 optical data also reveal that El Gordo is undergoing a major merger between components with a mass ratio of approximately 2 to 1. The X-ray data show significant temperature variations from a low of 6.6/-0.7 keV at the merging low-entropy, high-metallicity, cool core to a high of 22/-6 keV. We also see a wake in the X-ray surface brightness caused by the passage of one cluster through the other. Archival radio data at 843 MHz reveal diffuse radio emission that, if associated with the cluster, indicates the presence of an intense double radio relic, hosted by the highest redshift cluster yet. El Gordo is possibly a high-redshift analog of the famous Bullet Cluster. Such a massive cluster at this redshift is rare, although consistent with the standard L-CDM cosmology in the lower part of its allowed mass range. Massive, high-redshift mergers like El Gordo are unlikely to be reproduced in the current generation of numerical N-body cosmological simulations.",11,[],1

1111.7023,astro-ph,"Whether the Cygnus X complex consists of one physically connected region of star formation or of multiple independent regions projected close together on the sky has been debated for decades. The main reason for this puzzling scenario is the lack of trustworthy distance measurements. We aim to understand the structure and dynamics of the star-forming regions toward Cygnus X by accurate distance and proper motion measurements. To measure trigonometric parallaxes, we observed 6.7 GHz methanol and 22 GHz water masers with the European VLBI Network and the Very Long Baseline Array. We measured the trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of five massive star-forming regions toward the Cygnus X complex and report the following distances within a 10% accuracy: 1.30-0.07 kpc for W 75N, 1.460.09-0.08 kpc for DR 20, 1.500.08-0.07 kpc for DR 21, 1.360.12-0.11 kpc for IRAS202904052, and 3.33-0.11kpc for AFGL 2591. While the distances of W 75N, DR 20, DR 21, and IRAS 202904052 are consistent with a single distance of 1.40-0.08 kpc for the Cygnus X complex, AFGL 2591 is located at a much greater distance than previously assumed.

1111.5202,astro-ph,"We present SDO/AIA observations of the interaction of a global EUV wave on 2011 June 7 with active regions (ARs), coronal holes (CHs) and coronal bright structures. The primary global wave has a three-dimensional dome shape, with propagation speeds ranging from 430-780 km/s in different directions. The primary coronal wave runs in front of the expanding loops involved in the CME and its propagation speeds are approximately constant within 10-20 minutes. Upon arrival at an AR on its path, the primary EUV wave apparently disappears and a secondary wave rapidly reemerges 75 Mm within the AR boundary at a similar speed. When the EUV wave encounters a coronal bright structure, an additional wave front appears there and propagates in front of it at a velocity nearly a factor of 2 faster. Reflected waves from a polar CH and a coronal bright structure are observed and propagate fractionally slower than the primary waves. Some of these phenomena can be equally explained by either a wave or non-wave model alone. However, taken together, these observations provide new evidence for the multitudes of global EUV waves, in which a true MHD fast-mode wave or shock propagates in front of an expanding CME bubble.",11,[],1
1102.0590,astro-ph,"We present accurate absolute astrometry of 6.7 GHz methanol masers detected in the Arecibo Methanol Maser Galactic Plane Survey using MERLIN and the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA). We estimate the absolute astrometry to be accurate to better than 15 and 80 milliarcseconds for the MERLIN and EVLA observations respectively. We also derive the morphologies of the maser emission distributions for sources stronger than ~ 1 Jy. The median spatial extent along the major axis of the regions showing maser emission is ~ 775 AU. We find a majority of methanol maser morphologies to be complex with some sources previously determined to have regular morphologies in fact being embedded within larger structures. This suggests that some maser spots do not have a compact core, which leads them being resolved in high angular resolution observations. This also casts doubt on interpretations of the origin of methanol maser emission solely based on source morphologies. We also investigate the association of methanol masers with mid-infrared emission and find very close correspondence between methanol masers and 24 micron point sources. This adds further credence to theoretical models that predict methanol masers to be pumped by warm dust emission and firmly reinforces the finding that Class II methanol masers are unambiguous tracers of embedded high-mass protostars.",11,[],1
1108.4905,astro-ph,"In recent high resolution N-body CDM simulations, it has been had found that nonsingular three-parameter models, e.g. the Einasto profile has a better performance better than the singular two-parameter models, e.g. the Navarro, Frenk and White in the fitting of a wide range of dark matter halos. A problem with this profile is that the surface mass density is non-analytical for general values of the Einasto index. Therefore, its other lensing properties have the same problem. We obtain an exact analytical expression for the surface mass density of the Einasto profile in terms of the Fox H-function for all values of the Einasto index. With the idea of facilitate the use of the Einasto profile in lensing studies, we calculate the surface mass density, deflection angle, lens equation, deflection potential, magnification, shear and critical curves of the Einasto profile in terms of the Meijer G-function for all rational values of the Einasto index. The Meijer G-function have been implemented in several commercial and open-source computer algebra systems, thus the use of the lensing properties of the Einasto profile in strong and weak lensing studies is straighforward. We also compare the S\'ersic and Einasto surface mass densities profiles and found differences between them. This implies that the lensing properties are not equal for both profiles.",11,[],1
1103.2233,astro-ph,"Static distributions of temperature and wind velocity at the transition region are calculated within the framework of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of completely ionized hydrogen plasma. The numerical solution of the derived equations gives the width of the transition layer between the chromosphere and the corona as a self-induced opacity of high-frequency Alfven waves (AW). The domain wall is direct consequence of the self-consistent MHD treatment of AW propagation. The low-frequency MHD waves coming from the Sun are strongly reflected by the narrow transition layer, while the high-frequency waves are absorbed - that is why we predict considerable spectral density of the AW in the photosphere. The numerical method allows consideration of incoming AW with arbitrary spectral density. The idea that Alfven waves might heat the solar corona belongs to Alfven, we simply solved the corresponding MHD equations. The comparison of the solution to the experiment is crucial for revealing the heating mechanism.",11,[],1
1112.0533,astro-ph,"The galactic neighborhood, extending from the Milky Way to redshifts of about 0.1, is our unique local laboratory for detailed study of galaxies and their interplay with the environment. Such study provides a foundation of knowledge for interpreting observations of more distant galaxies and their environment. The Astro 2010 Science Frontier Galactic Neighborhood Panel identified four key scientific questions: 1) What are the flows of matter and energy in the circumgalactic medium? 2) What controls the mass-energy-chemical cycles within galaxies? 3) What is the fossil record of galaxy assembly from first stars to present? 4) What are the connections between dark and luminous matter? These questions, essential to the understanding of galaxies as interconnected complexes, can be addressed most effectively and/or uniquely in the galactic neighborhood. The panel also highlighted the discovery potential of time-domain astronomy and astrometry with powerful new techniques and facilities to greatly advance our understanding of the precise connections among stars, galaxies, and newly discovered transient events. The relevant needs for laboratory astrophysics will be emphasized, especially in the context of supporting NASA missions.",11,[],1
1104.1933,astro-ph,"We investigate the formation and evolution of high-order massive star multiples similar to the Trapezium in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We perform ensembles of N-body simulations of the evolution of N=1000 Orion-like clusters with initial conditions ranging from cool and clumpy to relatively smooth and relaxed. We find that trapezium-like systems are frequently formed in the first 2 Myr in initially cool and clumpy clusters and can survive for significant amounts of time in such clusters. We also find that these systems are highly dynamical entities, constantly interacting with the surrounding cluster, changing their appearance and membership regularly. The eventual decay of trapezium-like systems can even destroy the host cluster. We argue that the current state of any trapezium-like system is transient and care should be taken when analysing and drawing conclusions from a single snapshot in the life of a highly dynamic object.",11,[],1
1102.0111,astro-ph,"We present a detailed thermal and structural analysis of a 2m class solar telescope mirror which is subjected to a varying heat load at an observatory site. A 3-dimensional heat transfer model of the mirror takes into account the heating caused by a smooth and gradual increase of the solar flux during the day-time observations and cooling resulting from the exponentially decaying ambient temperature at night. The thermal and structural response of two competing materials for optical telescopes, namely Silicon Carbide -best known for excellent heat conductivity and Zerodur -preferred for its extremely low coefficient of thermal expansion, is investigated in detail. The insight gained from these simulations will provide a valuable input for devising an efficient and stable thermal control system for the primary mirror.",11,[],1
1110.4226,astro-ph,"We present dynamical scaling relations for a homogeneous and representative sample of ~500 massive galaxies, selected only by stellar mass (>1010 Msun) and redshift (0.025<z<0.05) as part of the ongoing GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey. We compare baryonic Tully-Fisher (BTF) and Faber-Jackson (BFJ) relations for this sample, and investigate how galaxies scatter around the best fits obtained for pruned subsets of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated systems. The BFJ relation is significantly less scattered than the BTF when the relations are applied to their maximum samples, and is not affected by the inclination problems that plague the BTF. Disk-dominated, gas-rich galaxies systematically deviate from the BFJ relation defined by the spheroids. We demonstrate that by applying a simple correction to the stellar velocity dispersions that depends only on the concentration index of the galaxy, we are able to bring disks and spheroids onto the same dynamical relation -- in other words, we obtain a generalized BFJ relation that holds for all the galaxies in our sample, regardless of morphology, inclination or gas content, and has a scatter smaller than 0.1 dex. We find that disks and spheroids are offset in the stellar dispersion-size relation, and that the offset is removed when corrected dispersions are used instead. The generalized BFJ relation represents a fundamental correlation between the global dark matter and baryonic content of galaxies, which is obeyed by all (massive) systems regardless of morphology.

1105.2860,astro-ph,"In this paper, we want to check whether or not the carbon abundance can be affected by initial metallicity. We calculated a series of stellar evolution. We found that when equation, the carbon abundance is almost independent of metallicity if it is plotted against the initial WD mass. However, when equation, the carbon abundance is not only a function of the initial WD mass, but also metallicity, i.e. for a given initial WD mass, the higher the metallicity, the lower the carbon abundance. Based on some previous studies, i.e. both a high metallicity and a low carbon abundance lead to a lower production of equationNi formed during SN Ia explosion, the effects of the carbon abundance and the metallicity on the amount of equationNi are enhanced by each other, which may account for the variation of maximum luminosity of SNe Ia, at least qualitatively. Considering that the central density of WD before supernova explosion may also play a role on the production of equationNi and the carbon abundance, the metallicity and the central density are all determined by the initial parameters of progenitor system, i.e. the initial WD mass, metallicity, orbital period and secondary mass, the amount of equationNi might be a function of the initial parameters. Then, our results might construct a bridge linking the progenitor model and the explosion model of SNe Ia.",11,[],1
1103.1304,astro-ph,"The Rotating RAdio Transient (RRAT) J1819-1458 exhibits ~3 ms bursts in the radio every ~3 min, implying that it is visible for only ~1 per day. Assuming that the optical light behaves in a similar manner, long exposures of the field would be relatively insensitive due to the accumulation of sky photons. A much better way of detecting optical emission from J1819-1458 would then be to observe with a high-speed optical camera simultaneously with radio observations, and co-add only those optical frames coincident with the dispersion-corrected radio bursts. We present the results of such a search, using simultaneous ULTRACAM and Lovell Telescope observations. We find no evidence for optical bursts in J1819-1458 at magnitudes brighter than i'=19.3 (5-sigma limit). This is nearly 3 magnitudes fainter than the previous burst limit, which had no simultaneous radio observations.",11,[],1
1102.4444,astro-ph,"We provide a census of the apparent stellar angular momentum within 1 Re of a volume-limited sample of 260 early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the nearby Universe, using integral-field spectroscopy obtained in the course of the ATLAS3D project. We exploit the LambdaR parameter to characterise the existence of two families of ETGs: Slow Rotators which exhibit complex stellar velocity fields and often include stellar kinematically Distinct Cores (KDCs), and Fast Rotators which have regular velocity fields. Our complete sample of 260 ETGs leads to a new criterion to disentangle Fast and Slow Rotators which now includes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity (Epsilon). It separates the two classes significantly better than the previous prescription, and than a criterion based on V/Sigma: Slow Rotators and Fast Rotators have LambdaR lower and larger than kFSxSQRT(Epsilon), respectively, where kFS=0.31 for measurements made within 1 Re. We show that the vast majority of early-type galaxies are Fast Rotators: these have regular stellar rotation, with aligned photometric and kinematic axes (Paper II, Krajnovic et al. 2011, include discs and often bars and represent 86% (224/260) of all early-type galaxies in the volume-limited ATLAS3D sample. Fast Rotators span the full range of apparent ellipticities from 0 to 0.85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsic ellipticities from about 0.35 to 0.85, the most flattened having morphologies consistent with spiral galaxies. Only a small fraction of ETGs are Slow Rotators representing 14% (36/260) of the ATLAS3D sample of ETGs. Of all Slow Rotators, 11% (4/36) exhibit two counter-rotating stellar disc-like components and are rather low mass objects (Mdyn<1010.5 MSun).

1102.3759,astro-ph,"We report on extensive photometry of DK Lac obtained during the interval 1990-2009, which includes a 2 mag low state during 2001-2003. Much of the photometry consists of exposures obtained with a typical spacing of several days, but also includes 26 sequences of continuous photometry each lasting 2 to 7 hours. We find no evidence for periodicities in our data. We do find that the random variations in the low state are ~2x those in the high state, when expressed in magnitudes. The lack of orbital-time-scale variations is attributed to the nearly face-on presentation of the disk. There is a 0.2 mag decline in the high state brightness of the system over 19 years, which is consistent with the behavior of other old novae in the decades following outburst. High-state spectra are also presented and discussed. We find that the equivalent width of Hequation falls by ~2x from 1991 to 2008. The photometric properties are discussed in the context of the hibernation scenario for the behavior of novae between outbursts, in which we conclude that low states in old novae are probably unrelated to their possible entrance into hibernation.",11,[],1

We also provide spectroscopic data, including radial velocity (22.4/-0.3 km s-1), lithium Equivalent Width (EW) (0.28/-0.02 A), H-alpha EW (-6.0 to -35 A), \it vsini (11/-1 km s-1), and gravity indicators from the Siding Spring 2.3-m WiFeS, Lick 3-m Hamilton echelle, and Keck-I HIRES echelle spectrographs. The combined observations demonstrate that AP Col is the closer of only two known systems within 10 pc of the Sun younger than 100 Myr.

1105.3450,astro-ph,"It is generally assumed that on sufficiently large scales the Universe is well-described as a homogeneous, isotropic FRW cosmology with a dark energy. Does the formation of nonlinear cosmic inhomogeneities produce a significant effect on the average large-scale FLRW dynamics? As an answer, we suggest that if the length scale at which homogeneity sets in is much smaller than the Hubble length scale, the back-reaction due to averaging over inhomogeneities is negligible. This result is supported by more than one approach to study of averaging in cosmology. Even if no single approach is sufficiently rigorous and compelling, they are all in agreement that the effect of averaging in the real Universe is small. On the other hand, it is perhaps fair to say that there is no definitive observational evidence yet that there indeed is a homogeneity scale which is much smaller than the Hubble scale, or for that matter, if today's Universe is indeed homogeneous on large scales. If the Copernican principle can be observationally established to hold, or is theoretically assumed to be valid, this provides strong evidence for homogeneity on large scales. However, even this by itself does not say what the scale of homogeneity is. If that scale is today comparable to the Hubble radius, only a fully non-perturbative analysis can establish or rule out the importance of cosmological back-reaction. This brief elementary report summarizes some recent theoretical developments on which the above inferences are based.",11,[],1
1109.6495,astro-ph,"Interstellar dark clouds are the sites of star formation. Their main component, dihydrogen, exists under two states, ortho and para. H2 is supposed to form in the ortho:para ratio (OPR) of 3:1 and to subsequently decay to almost pure para-H2 (OPR <= 0.001). Only if the H2 OPR is low enough, will deuteration enrichment, as observed in the cores of these clouds, be efficient. The second condition for strong deuteration enrichment is the local disappearance of CO, which freezes out onto grains in the core formation process. We show that this latter condition does not apply to DCO, which, therefore, should be present all over the cloud. We find that an OPR >= 0.1 is necessary to prevent DCO large-scale apparition. We conclude that the inevitable decay of ortho-H2 sets an upper limit of ~6 million years to the age of starless molecular clouds under usual conditions.",11,[],1

The calculated PDF for the SNII fraction, SNIIin/total, defined as the number of SNII inside a spiral arm divided by the total number of SNII from a star formation event, provides a constraint on the magnitude of supernova remnant (SNR) concentrations used in cosmic ray propagation models attempting to explain the PAMELA anomaly.

We find the (anti)correlations among the light elements that would be expected on theoretical ground for matter that has been nuclearly processed via high-temperature proton captures. The overall [(CNO)/Fe] increases by 0.5 dex from [Fe/H] -2.0 to [Fe/H] -0.9.

1109.0228,astro-ph,"We present theoretical results for the expected fraction of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) to be detected as strong Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) in the redshift range 5 < z < 7. We base our analysis on the 2-billion particle SPH simulation MareNostrum High-z Universe. We approximate galaxies as static dusty slabs with an additional clumpy dust distribution affecting stellar populations younger than 25 Myr. The model for the Lyman alpha escape fraction is based on the results of our Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code (CLARA) for a slab configuration. We also fix the transmission of Lyman alpha photons through the intergalactic medium to a constant value of 50% at all redshifts. From the results of this model we calculate xLya, the fraction of Lyman Break Galaxies with Lyman alpha equivalent width (EW) larger than 50 Angstrom. We find a remarkable agreement with observational data at 4.5 < z < 6. For bright (-22 < MUV < -20.5) and faint (-20.5 < MUV < -18.5) galaxies our model predicts xLya = 0.02  0.01 and xLya = 0.47  0.01 while observers report xLya = 0.08  0.02 and xLya = 0.47  0.16, respectively. Additional evolution of the extinction model at redshift z \sim 7, that decreases the intensity of transmitted Lyman alpha radiation by a factor of fT = 0.4 as to match the LAE luminosity function at z \sim 6.5, naturally provides a good match for the recently reported xLya fractions at z > 6.3. Exploring different toy models for the Lyman alpha escape fraction, we show that a decreasing Lyman alpha escape fraction with increasing UV galaxy luminosity is a key element in our model to explain the of larger xLya fractions for fainter LBGs.",11,[],1
1111.6373,astro-ph,"We highlight and discuss the importance of accounting for nebular emission in the SEDs of high redshift galaxies, as lines and continuum emission can contribute significantly or subtly to broad-band photometry. Physical parameters such as the galaxy age, mass, star-formation rate, dust attenuation and others inferred from SED fits can be affected to different extent by the treatment of nebular emission.   We analyse a large sample of Lyman break galaxies from z~3-6, and show some main results illustrating e.g. the importance of nebular emission for determinations of the mass-SFR relation, attenuation and age. We suggest that a fairly large scatter in such relations could be intrinsic. We find that the majority of objects (~60-70%) is better fit with SEDs accounting for nebular emission; the remaining galaxies are found to show relatively weak or no emission lines. Our modeling, and supporting empirical evidence, suggests the existence of two categories of galaxies, ""starbursts"" and ""post-starbursts"" (lower SFR and older galaxies) among the LBG population, and relatively short star-formation timescales.",11,[],1

1106.2708,astro-ph,"We present a timing and spectral analysis of the variable X-ray source 3A 1954319. Our analysis is mainly based on an outburst serendipitously observed during INTEGRAL Key Program observations of the Cygnus region in 2008 fall and on the Swift/BAT longterm light curve. Previous observations, though sparse, have identified the source to be one of only nine known symbiotic X-ray binaries, i.e., systems composed of an accreting neutron star orbiting in a highly inhomogeneous medium around an M-giant companion. The spectrum of 3A 1954319 above 20 keV can be best described by a broken power law model. The extremely long pulse period of ~5.3 hours is clearly visible in the INTEGRAL/ISGRI light curve and confirmed through an epoch folding period search. Furthermore, the light curve allows us to determine a very strong spin up of -2x10-4 h/h during the outburst. This spin up is confirmed by the pulse period evolution calculated from Swift/BAT data. The Swift/BAT data also show a long spin-down trend prior to the 2008 outburst, which is confirmed in archival INTEGRAL/ISGRI data. We discuss possible accretion models and geometries allowing for the transfer of such large amounts of angular momentum and investigate the harder spectrum of this outburst compared to previously published results.",11,[],1

We more than quadruple the size of the galaxy sample compared to previous work and include targets with a wide range of galaxy properties. Even though the disk galaxies in this study span a wide range of properties, we find a strong and approximately linear correlation between SigmaSFR and SigmaH2 at our common resolution of 1kpc. This implies a roughly constant median H2 consumption time, tauH2 = SigmaH2 / SigmaSFR, of ~2.35Gyr (including heavy elements) across our sample. At 1kpc resolution, there is only a weak correlation between SigmaH2 and tauH2 over the range SigmaH2~5-100Msun/pc2, which is probed by our data. We compile a broad set of literature measurements that have been obtained using a variety of star formation tracers, sampling schemes and physical scales and show that overall, these data yield almost exactly the same results, although with more scatter. We interpret these results as strong, albeit indirect evidence that star formation proceeds in a uniform way in giant molecular clouds in the disks of spiral galaxies.",11,[],1

Additionally, there are numerous faint solar features, such as coronal holes and coronal dimmings, which are important for space weather monitoring and forecasting, but their low intensity and sometimes transient nature makes them problematic to detect using traditional image processing techniques. These difficulties are compounded by advances in ground- and space- based instrumentation, which have increased the volume of data that solar physicists are confronted with on a minute-by-minute basis; NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory for example is returning many thousands of images per hour (~1.5 TB/day).

We have built a database consisting of hundreds of observations, which allows us to examine how extinction varies with airmass and the column density of water vapour. In addition, we use theoretical models of the atmosphere to estimate Rayleigh scattering and molecular absorption in order to quantify their fractional contribution to the total extinction in each filter. Finally, we have observed 8 bright red standard stars to evaluate filter color terms. We find that extinction coefficients are < 0.1 mag/airmass in all the considered bands. The extinction coefficient in the J-band strongly depends on the column density of water vapour. Molecular absorption dominates the extinction in J, H and Ks, while Rayleigh scattering contributes most to the extinction in Js.

1103.1084,astro-ph,"We present here a new solution for the astronomical computation of the orbital motion of the Earth spanning from 0 to -250 Myr. The main improvement with respect to the previous numerical solution La2004 (Laskar et al. 2004) is an improved adjustment of the parameters and initial conditions through a fit over 1 Myr to a special version of the high accurate numerical ephemeris INPOP08 (Fienga et al. 2009). The precession equations have also been entirely revised and are no longer averaged over the orbital motion of the Earth and Moon. This new orbital solution is now valid over more than 50 Myr in the past or in the future with proper phases of the eccentricity variations. Due to chaotic behavior, the precision of the solution decreases rapidly beyond this time span, and we discuss the behavior of various solutions beyond 50 Myr. For paleoclimate calibrations, we provide several different solutions that are all compatible with the most precise planetary ephemeris.

1112.5878,astro-ph,"The measurement of the solar diameter is introduced in the wider framework of solar variability and of the influences of the Sun upon the Earth's climate. Ancient eclipses and planetary transits would permit to extend the knowledge of the solar irradiance back to three centuries, through the parameter W=dLogR/dLogL. The method of Baily's beads timing during eclipses is discussed, and a significant improvement with respect to the last 40 years has been obtained by reconstructing the Limb Darkening Function's inflexion point from their light curve and the corresponding lunar valleys' profiles. The case of the Jan 15, 2010 annular eclipse has been studied in detail, as well as the last two transits of Venus. The atlas of Baily's beads, realized with worldwide contributions by IOTA members is presented along with the solar diameter during the eclipse of 2006. The transition between the photographic atlas of the lunar limb (Watts, 1963) and the laser-altimeter map made by the Kaguya lunar probe in 2009 has been followed. The other method for the accurate measurement of the solar diameter alternative to the PICARD / PICARD-sol mission is the drift-scan method used either by the solar astrolabes either by larger telescopes. The observatories of Locarno and Paris have started an observational program of the Sun with this method with encouraging results. For the first time an image motion of the whole Sun has been detected at frequencies of 1/100 Hz.

1108.3822,astro-ph,"We develop a general framework for interpreting and analyzing high-precision lightcurves from eccentric stellar binaries. Although our methods are general, we focus on the recently discovered Kepler system KOI-54, a face-on binary of two A stars with equation and an orbital period of 42 days. KOI-54 exhibits strong ellipsoidal variability during its periastron passage; its lightcurve also contains ~20 pulsations at perfect harmonics of the orbital frequency, and another ~10 nonharmonic pulsations. Analysis of such data is a new form of asteroseismology in which oscillation amplitudes and phases rather than frequencies contain information that can be mined to constrain stellar properties. We qualitatively explain the physics of mode excitation and the range of harmonics expected to be observed. To quantitatively model observed pulsation spectra, we develop and apply a linear, tidally forced, nonadiabatic stellar oscillation formalism including the Coriolis force. We produce temporal power spectra for KOI-54 that are semi-quantitatively consistent with the observations. Both stars in the KOI-54 system are expected to be rotating pseudosynchronously, with resonant nonaxisymmetric modes providing a key contribution to the total torque; such resonances provide a possible explanation for the two largest-amplitude harmonic pulsations observed in KOI-54, although we find quantitative problems with this interpretation. We show in detail that the nonharmonic pulsations observed in KOI-54 can be produced by nonlinear three-mode coupling. The methods developed in this paper can be generalized in the future to determine the best-fit stellar parameters given pulsation data. We also derive an analytic model of KOI-54's ellipsoidal variability, including both tidal distortion and stellar irradiation, which can be used to model other similar systems.",11,[],1
1103.4791,astro-ph,"(Abridged) With the largest homogeneous quasar sample with optical spectra and robust radio morphology classifications assembled to date, we investigate quasar radio and optical properties with unprecedented statistical power. The data consist of 4714 radio quasars from FIRST with S20>2mJy and SDSS spectra. Radio morphology classes include core-only (core), core-lobe (lobe), core-jet (jet), lobe-core-lobe (triple), and double-lobe. We examine the optical colors of radio-morphology subsamples and find that radio quasars with core emission unresolved by FIRST (on 5"" scale) have a redder color distribution than radio-quiet quasars (S20<1mJy); other classes of radio quasars have optical color distributions similar to the radio-quiet quasars. This analysis also suggests that optical colors of z<2.7 SDSS quasars are not strongly (<0.1mag) biased blue. We show that the radio core-to-lobe flux density ratio (R) and the radio-to-optical (i-band) ratio of the quasar core (RI) are correlated, suggesting that both parameters are indicative of line-of-sight orientation. We investigate spectral line equivalent widths as a function of R and RI, including the [OIII] narrow line doublet and the CIV letter1549 and MgII letter2799 broad lines. We find that the rest equivalent widths (EWs) of the broad lines correlate positively with RI at the 4-8letter level. But we find no strong dependence of EW on R, in contrast to previous results. One interpretation is that EWs increase as the line-of-sight angle to the radio-jet axis decreases. These results are in stark contrast to commonly accepted orientation-based theories, which suggest that continuum emission should increase as the angle to the radio-jet axis decreases, resulting in smaller EW of emission lines (assumed isotropic). Finally, we find that the Baldwin effect in our sample does not depend on quasar radio morphology.",11,[],1
1104.0411,astro-ph,"We present a new analysis of the relative detectability of dark matter annihilation in the Milky Way's eight classical dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies. Ours is similar to previous analyses in that we use Markov-Chain Monte Carlo techniques to fit dark matter halo parameters to empirical velocity dispersion profiles via the spherical Jeans equation, but more general in the sense that we do not adopt priors derived from cosmological simulations. We show that even without strong constraints on the shapes of dSph dark matter density profiles (we require only that the inner profile satisfies -lim(r->0) [dlnrho/dln r] <=1), we obtain a robust and accurate constraint on the astrophysical component of a prospective dark matter annihilation signal, provided that the integration angle is approximately twice the projected half-light radius of the dSph divided by distance to the observer, alphaint~2rh/d. Using this integration angle, which represents a compromise between maximizing prospective flux and minimizing uncertainty in the dSph's dark matter distribution, we calculate the relative detectability of the classical dSphs by ground- and space-based gamma-ray observatories.",11,[],1
1111.5424,astro-ph,"We identify a physical mechanism that would have resulted in rapid, obscured growth of seed super-massive black-holes in galaxies at z>6. Specifically, we find that the density at the centre of typical high redshift galaxies was at a level where the Bondi accretion rate implies a diffusion speed of photons that was slower than the gravitational infall velocity, resulting in photons being trapped within the accretion flow and advected into the black-hole. We show that there is a range of black-hole masses (Mbh ~ 103-105 solar masses) where the accretion flow traps radiation, corresponding to black-holes that were massive enough to generate a photon trapping accretion flow, but small enough that their Bondi radii did not exceed the isothermal scale height of self-gravitating gas. Under these conditions we find that the accretion reaches levels far in excess of the Eddington rate. A prediction of this scenario is that X-ray number counts of active galactic nuclei at z>6 would exhibit a cutoff at the low luminosities corresponding to black-hole masses below ~105 solar masses. At low redshifts we find photon trapping to be unimportant because it could only occur in rare low spin halos, and would require black-hole masses in excess of expectations from the observed black-hole - halo mass relation. The super-Eddington growth of ~105 solar mass seed black-holes at high redshift may have provided a natural acceleration towards the growth of super-massive black-holes at z~6-7, less than a billion years after the Big Bang.",11,[],1

The dilution of the host star's light by the nearly equal magnitude stellar companion (~ 0.5 magnitudes fainter) significantly affects the derived planetary parameters, and if left uncorrected, leads to an underestimate of the radius and mass of the planet by 10% and 60%, respectively. Other published exoplanets, which have not been observed with high-resolution imaging, could similarly have unresolved stellar companions and thus have incorrectly derived planetary parameters.

1110.4763,astro-ph,"We report the first tungsten isotopic measurements in stardust silicon carbide (SiC) grains recovered from the Murchison carbonaceous chondrite. The isotopes 182W, 183W, 184W, 186W and 179Hf, 180Hf were measured on both an aggregate (KJB fraction) and single stardust SiC grains (LSLU fraction) believed to have condensed in the outflows of low-mass carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with close-to-solar metallicity. The SiC aggregate shows small deviations from terrestrial (=solar) composition in the 182W/184W and 183W/184W ratios, with deficits in 182W and 183W with respect to 184W. The 186W/184W ratio, however, shows no apparent deviation from the solar value. Tungsten isotopic measurements in single mainstream stardust SiC grains revealed lower than solar 182W/184W, 183W/184W, and 186W/184W ratios. We have compared the SiC data with theoretical predictions of the evolution of W isotopic ratios in the envelopes of AGB stars. These ratios are affected by the slow neutron-capture process and match the SiC data regarding their 182W/184W, 183W/184W, and 179Hf/180Hf isotopic compositions, although a small adjustment in the s-process production of 183W is needed in order to have a better agreement between the SiC data and model predictions. The models cannot explain the 186W/184W ratios observed in the SiC grains, even when the current 185W neutron-capture cross section is increased by a factor of two. Further study is required to better assess how model uncertainties (e.g., the formation of the 13C neutron source, the mass-loss law, the modelling of the third dredge-up, and the efficiency of the 22Ne neutron source) may affect current s-process predictions.",11,[],1
1111.3959,astro-ph,"On the basis of the PPMXL catalogue (Roser, Demleitner & Schilbach, 2010) we searched for white dwarfs that are also member candidates of the Hyades in a region up to 40 pc from the cluster centre. We use the proper motions from PPMXL in the convergent point method to determine probable kinematic members. We cross-match the kinematic candidates with catalogues containing white dwarfs and, finally, check the kinematic with the photometric distances for consistency. We find the 10 classical white dwarfs in the Hyades and determine their individual kinematic distances. Additionally, we identified 17 new probable (former) Hyades white dwarfs, i.e. white dwarfs co-moving with the bulk space motion of the Hyades cluster. At present, none of them can be excluded from membership on the basis of the measured radial velocities. For another 10 objects, the kinematic and the photometric distances are discordant which rates them as probable non-members. Among the probable members, five white dwarfs are in binary systems, three are known, two are new. There is good indication for an empirical magnitude-distance (from centre) relation, such that the dimmer white dwarfs are farther away from the cluster centre than the brighter ones. Our sample is getting incomplete close behind the centre of the cluster. Follow-up observations are encouraged to independently confirm the predicted radial velocities and the distances of the candidates.",11,[],1
1104.3008,astro-ph,"We investigate the evolutional and environmental effects on star formation efficiency for more than 400 merging galaxies. The ~400 merging systems, with photometric redshifts smaller than 0.7, are obtained from a catalog of ~15000 morphologically identified merging galaxies derived from observations of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. We also obtained the IR data of the merging galaxies from the Spitzer Wide-area InfraRed Extragalactic Survey (SWIRE). The redshift differences letter z between the member galaxies of these merging pairs show a large distribution with 0 < letter z < 0.4. We divide our merging pairs into two sub-samples with letter z < 0.05 and > 0.05 for further analyses. We find a statistically significant anti-correlation between the specific star formation rate (SSFR) and the separation of the merging galaxies for both sub-samples. Our analyses also show that although most of the merging systems do have enhanced star formation activity, only very rare ones display extremely high SFRs. Additionally, the SSFR of the merging galaxies also decreases when the magnitude difference between two member galaxies becomes large. However, we find that for the merging pairs with large luminosity contrast, the fainter components show higher SSFR than the brighter ones. Finally, there is a higher fraction of gas-poor mergers in galaxy clusters, and the SSFR of gas-rich mergers is reduced in cluster environments.",11,[],1
1107.6005,astro-ph,"Close-in, massive exoplanets raise significant tides in their stellar hosts. We compute the radial velocity (RV) signal due to this fluid motion in the equilibrium tide approximation. The predicted radial velocities in the observed sample of exoplanets exceed 1 m/s for 17 systems, with the largest predicted signal being ~30 m/s for WASP-18 b. Tidally-induced RV's are thus detectable with present methods. Both tidal fluid flow and the epicyclic motion of a slightly eccentric orbit produce an RV signal at twice the orbital frequency. If care is not taken, the tidally induced RV may, in some cases, be confused with a finite orbital eccentricity. Indeed, WASP-18 b is reported to have an eccentric orbit with small e=0.009 and pericenter longitude letter=-letter/2. Whereas such a close alignment of the orbit and line of sight to the observer requires fine tuning, this phase in the RV signal is naturally explained by the tidal velocity signature of an e=0 orbit. Additionally, the equilibrium tide estimate for the amplitude is in rough agreement with the data. Thus the reported eccentricity for WASP-18 b is instead likely a signature of the tidally-induced RV in the stellar host. Measurement of both the orbital and tidal velocity for non-transiting planets may allow planet mass and inclination to be separately determined solely from radial velocity data. We suggest that high precision fitting of RV data should include the tidal velocity signal in those cases where it may affect the determination of orbital parameters.",11,[],1
1110.0941,astro-ph,"We present deep radio continuum observations of the cores identified as deeply embedded young stellar objects in the Serpens molecular cloud by the Spitzer c2d programme at a wavelength of 1.8cm with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array (AMI-LA). These observations have a resolution of ~30arcsec and an average sensitivity of 19microJy/beam. The targets are predominantly Class I sources, and we find the detection rate for Class I objects in this sample to be low (18%) compared to that of Class 0 objects (67%), consistent with previous works. For detected objects we examine correlations of radio luminosity with bolometric luminosity and envelope mass and find that these data support correlations found by previous samples, but do not show any indiction of the evolutionary divide hinted at by similar data from the Perseus molecular cloud when comparing radio luminosity with envelope mass. We conclude that envelope mass provides a better indicator for radio luminosity than bolometric luminosity, based on the distribution of deviations from the two correlations. Combining these new data with archival 3.6cm flux densities we also examine the spectral indices of these objects and find an average spectral index of 0.53/-1.14, consistent with the canonical value for a partially optically thick spherical or collimated stellar wind. However, we caution that possible inter-epoch variability limits the usefulness of this value, and such variability is supported by our identification of a possible flare in the radio history of Serpens SMM 1.",11,[],1
1111.1785,astro-ph,"We present a study of local post-starburst galaxies (PSGs) using the photometric and spectroscopic observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the results from the Galaxy Zoo project. We find that the majority of our local PSG population have neither early- nor late- type morphologies but occupy a well-defined space within the colour-stellar mass diagram, most notably, the low-mass end of the ""green valley"" below the transition mass thought to be the mass division between low-mass star-forming galaxies and high-mass passively-evolving bulge-dominated galaxies. Our analysis suggests that it is likely that a local PSG will quickly transform into ""red"", low-mass early-type galaxies as the stellar morphologies of the ""green"" PSGs largely resemble that of the early-type galaxies within the same mass range. We propose that the current population of PSGs represents a population of galaxies which is rapidly transitioning between the star-forming and the passively-evolving phases. Subsequently, these PSGs will contribute towards the build-up of the low-mass end of the ""red sequence"" once the current population of young stars fade and stars are no longer being formed. These results are consistent with the idea of ""downsizing"" where the build-up of smaller galaxies occurs at later epochs.",11,[],1
1107.0679,astro-ph,"We have observed the radio nebula surrounding the Galactic LBV candidate G79.290.46 with the EVLA at 6 cm. These new radio observations allow a morphological comparison between the radio emission, which traces the ionized gas component, and the mid-IR emission, a tracer of the dust component. The IRAC (8 letter m) and MIPS (24 letter m and 70 letter m) images have been reprocessed and compared with the EVLA map. We confirm the presence of a second shell at 24 letter m and also provide evidence for its detection at 70 letter m. The differences between the spatial morphology of the radio and mid-IR maps indicate the existence of two dust populations, the cooler one emitting mostly at longer wavelengths. Analysis of the two dusty, nested shells have provided us with an estimate of the characteristic timescales for shell ejection, providing important constraints for stellar evolutionary models. Finer details of the ionized gas distribution can be appreciated thanks to the improved quality of the new 6 cm image, most notably the highly structured texture of the nebula. Evidence of interaction between the nebula and the surrounding interstellar medium can be seen in the radio map, including brighter features that delineate regions where the shell structure is locally modified. In particular, the brighter filaments in the south-west region appear to frame the shocked southwestern clump reported from CO observations.",11,[],1
1106.6045,astro-ph,"Parametrising galaxy morphologies is a challenging task, e.g., in shear measurements of weak lensing or investigations of galaxy evolution. The huge variety of morphologies requires an approach that is highly flexible, e.g., accounting for azimuthal structure. We revisit the method of sersiclets, where galaxy morphologies are decomposed into basis functions based on the Sersic profile. This approach is justified by the fact that the Sersic profile is the first-order Taylor expansion of any real light profile. We show that sersiclets overcome the modelling failures of shapelets. However, sersiclets implicate an unphysical relation between the steepness of the light profile and the spatial scale of azimuthal structures, which is not obeyed by real galaxy morphologies and can therefore give rise to modelling failures. Moreover, we demonstrate that sersiclets are prone to undersampling, which restricts sersiclet modelling to highly resolved galaxy images. Analysing data from the Great08 challenge, we demonstrate that sersiclets should not be used in weak-lensing studies. We conclude that although the sersiclet approach appears very promising at first glance, it suffers from conceptual and practical problems that severly limit its usefulness. The Sersic profile can be enhanced by higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion, which can drastically improve model reconstructions of galaxy images. If orthonormalised, these higher-order profiles can overcome the problems of sersiclets while preserving their mathematical justification.",11,[],1

We find lower values for the age, metallicity and Mg/Fe abundance ratio in the center of this galaxy when we compare them with other isolated elliptical galaxies with similar velocity dispersion.

1106.2548,astro-ph,"We present precise radial-velocity measurements of WASP-1 and WASP-2 throughout transits of their giant planets. Our goal was to detect the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, the anomalous radial velocity observed during eclipses of rotating stars, which can be used to study the obliquities of planet-hosting stars. For WASP-1 a weak signal of a prograde orbit was detected with ~2sigma confidence, and for WASP-2 no signal was detected. The resulting upper bounds on the RM amplitude have different implications for these two systems, because of the contrasting transit geometries and the stellar types. Because WASP-1 is an F7V star, and such stars are typically rapid rotators, the most probable reason for the suppression of the RM effect is that the star is viewed nearly pole-on. This implies the WASP-1 star has a high obliquity with respect to the edge-on planetary orbit. Because WASP-2 is a K1V star, and is expected to be a slow rotator, no firm conclusion can be drawn about the stellar obliquity. Our data and our analysis contradict an earlier claim that WASP-2b has a retrograde orbit, thereby revoking this system's status as an exception to the pattern that cool stars have low obliquities.",11,[],1

Here we present the simulation results for two types of GRB optical afterglows, differing in the observer's line-of-sight compared to a GRB jet axis: regular (on-axis) and orphan afterglows.

At longer wavelengths, however, we find that the extinction is grayer than shortward of 2.8 micron.

1108.1474,astro-ph,"Large Scale Structures (LSS) in the universe can be traced using the neutral atomic hydrogen HI through its 21cm emission. Such a 3D matter distribution map can be used to test the Cosmological model and to constrain the Dark Energy properties or its equation of state. A novel approach, called intensity mapping can be used to map the HI distribution, using radio interferometers with large instantaneous field of view and waveband. In this paper, we study the sensitivity of different radio interferometer configurations, or multi-beam instruments for the observation of large scale structures and BAO oscillations in 21cm and we discuss the problem of foreground removal. For each configuration, we determine instrument response by computing the (u,v) or Fourier angular frequency plane coverage using visibilities. The (u,v) plane response is the noise power spectrum, hence the instrument sensitivity for LSS P(k) measurement. We describe also a simple foreground subtraction method to separate LSS 21 cm signal from the foreground due to the galactic synchrotron and radio sources emission. We have computed the noise power spectrum for different instrument configuration as well as the extracted LSS power spectrum, after separation of 21cm-LSS signal from the foregrounds.

Combining new 250, 350, and 500 micron observations with existing data, we make an improved fit to the FIR spectral energy distribution (SED) of this galaxy. We find a total infrared (IR) luminosity of L(8--1000 micron) = 6.9 /- 0.6x1011 Lsol; a factor of 3 more precise over previous LIR estimates for this galaxy, and one of the most accurate measurements for any galaxy at these redshifts. This FIR luminosity implies an unlensed star formation rate (SFR) for this galaxy of 119 /- 10 Msol per yr, which is a factor of 1.9 /- 0.35 lower than the SFR derived from the nebular Pa-alpha emission line (a 2.5-sigma discrepancy). Both SFR indicators assume identical Salpeter initial mass functions (IMF) with slope Gamma=2.35 over a mass range of 0.1 - 100 Msol, thus this discrepancy suggests that more ionizing photons may be necessary to account for the higher Pa-alpha-derived SFR. We examine a number of scenarios and find that the observations can be explained with a varying star formation history (SFH) due to an increasing star formation rate (SFR), paired with a slight flattening of the IMF. If the SFR is constant in time, then larger changes need to be made to the IMF by either increasing the upper-mass cutoff to ~ 200 Msol, or a flattening of the IMF slope to 1.9 /- 0.15, or a combination of the two. These scenarios result in up to double the number of stars with masses above 20 Msol, which produce the requisite increase in ionizing photons over a Salpeter IMF with a constant SFH.",11,[],1

We analyze the second-order dipole allowed process that the strong perturbation works through the intermediate state in which the spin degree of freedom is lost at the core-hole site. Within the approximation neglecting the perturbation on the neighboring sites, we derive the spin-flip final state in the scattering channel with changing the polarization, which leads to the RIXS spectra expressed as the dynamical structure factor of the transverse spin components. We assume a spherical form of the spin-conserving final state in the channel without changing the polarization, which leads to the RIXS spectra expressed as the 'exchange'-type multi-spin correlation function. Evaluating numerically the transition amplitudes to these final states on a finite-size cluster, we obtain a sizable amount of the transition amplitude to the spin-conserving final state in comparison with that to the spin-flip final state. We treat the itinerant magnetic excitations in the final state by means of the 1/S-expansion method. Evaluating the higher-order correction with 1/S, we find that the peak arising from the one-magnon excitation is reduced with its weight, and the continuous spectra arising from the three-magnon excitations come out. The interaction between two magnons is treated by summing up the ladder diagrams. On the basis of these results, we analyze the L3-edge RIXS spectra in Sr2CuO2Cl2 in comparison with the experiment.

Compared to free-standing graphene, the formation energies of the dopants can decrease by as much as 8 eV. The type and density of the charge carriers of epitaxial graphene layer can be effectively manipulated by suitable dopants and surface passivation. More importantly, contrasting to the direct doping of graphene, the charge carriers in epitaxial graphene layer are weakly scattered by dopants due to the spatial separation between dopants and the conducting channel.

Disorder is applied as a box-distribution to the force-constants equation of the springs. We obtain the reduced localization lengths equation from calculated Lyapunov exponents for different system widths to roughly locate the squared critical transition frequency equation. The data is finite-size scaled to acquire the squared critical transition frequency of equation and a critical exponent of equation.,11,[],8

First, we check our procedure in the exactly solvable XXZ spin-1/2 chain in its entire critical region, finding very good agreement with Bethe ansatz results. Then, we show how phase transitions between different dominant orders may be efficiently estimated by considering the superfluid-charge density wave transition in a system of dipolar bosons. Finally, we discuss the application of this method to multispecies systems such as the one dimensional Hubbard model.

1102.1222,cond-mat,"Monte Carlo simulation using the standard single-spin flip algorithm often fails to sample over the entire configuration space at low temperatures for frustrated spin systems. A typical example is a class of spin-ice type Ising models. In this case, the difficulty can be avoided by introducing a global-flip algorithm, the loop algorithm. Similar difficulty is encountered in O(3) Heisenberg models in the presence of biquadratic interaction. The loop algorithm, however, is not straightforwardly applied to this case, since the system does not have a priori spin-anisotropy axis for constructing the loops. We propose an extension of the loop algorithm to the bilinear-biquadratic models. The efficiency is tested for three different ways to flip spins on a loop in Monte Carlo simulation. We show that the most efficient method depends on the strength of the biquadratic interaction.",11,[],8

It is demonstrated that stationary deflagration is unstable with respect to one-dimensional perturbations if the energy barrier of the magnets is sufficiently high in comparison with the release of Zeeman energy at the front; their ratio may be interpreted as an analogue to the Zeldovich number, as found in problems of combustion. When the Zeldovich number exceeds a certain critical value, a stationary deflagration front becomes unstable and propagates in a pulsating regime. Analytical estimates for the critical Zeldovich number are obtained. The linear stage of the instability is investigated numerically by solving the eigenvalue problem. The nonlinear stage is studied using direct numerical simulations. The parameter domain required for experimental observations of the pulsating regime is discussed.",11,[],8

In situ tunable p-n junctions can be generated at any position along the nanotube axis. Combining SPCM with transport measurements allows a detailed microscopic study of the evolution of the band profiles as a function of the gates voltage. Here we study the emergence of a p-n and a n-p junctions out of a n-type transistor channel using two local gates. In both cases the I-V curves recorded for gate configurations corresponding to the formation of the p-n or n-p junction in the SPCM measurements reveal a clear transition from resistive to rectification regimes.

Because the ferromagnetic Kondo interaction is marginally irrelevant, perturbative methods should prove accurate down to low energies. For the purpose of this study, we use a combination of Majorana diagrammatic theory with Density Matrix Numerical Renormalization Group simulations. In the standard case of antiferromagnetic Kondo exchange, we first show that our technique recovers previously obtained results for the T-matrix and spin relaxation at weak coupling (above the Kondo temperature).

Nevertheless, we have found that the ARPES spectra basically agree with band dispersions calculated in the local density approximation (LDA) if the bandwidth is reduced by a factor of ~2.5 and then the chemical potential is lowered by ~70 meV.

This formulation provides rigorous electrostatics of finite extent solids, including films and nanowires.",11,[],8
1107.2585,cond-mat,"The spin-orbit interaction in a solid couples the spin of an electron to its momentum. This coupling gives rise to mutual conversion between spin and charge currents: the direct and inverse spin Hall effects. The spin Hall effects have been observed in metals and semiconductors. However, the spin/charge conversion has not been realized in one of the most fundamental semiconductors, silicon, where accessing the spin Hall effects has been believed to be difficult because of its very weak spin-orbit interaction. Here we report observation of the inverse spin Hall effect in silicon at room temperature. The spin/charge current conversion efficiency, the spin Hall angle, is obtained as 0.0001 for a p-type silicon film. In spite of the small spin Hall angle, we found a clear electric voltage due to the inverse spin Hall effect in the p-Si film, demonstrating that silicon can be used as a spin-current detector.",11,[],8

We use Bogoliubov theory to treat the weakly interacting superfluid regime. Near the Mott transition, we calculate the stability phase diagram within a variational Gutzwiller wavefunction approach. In the deep Mott limit we discuss the emergence of the Heisenberg model and calculate the stability diagram within this model. Though the Bogoliubov theory and the Heisenberg model (appropriate for deep superfluid and deep Mott phase respectively) predict no dynamical instabilities, we find, interestingly, between these two limiting cases there is a regime of dynamical instability.

1105.1655,cond-mat,"We present a density functional study of graphene adhesion on a realistic SiOequation surface taking into account van der Waals (vdW) interactions. The SiOequation substrate is modeled at the local scale by using two main types of surface defects, typical for amorphous silica: the oxygen dangling bond and three-coordinated silicon. The results show that the nature of adhesion between graphene and its substrate is qualitatively dependent on the surface defect type. In particular, the interaction between graphene and silicon-terminated SiOequation originates exclusively from the vdW interaction, whereas the oxygen-terminated surface provides additional ionic contribution to the binding arising from interfacial charge transfer (equation-type doping of graphene). Strong doping contrast for the different surface terminations provides a mechanism for the charge inhomogeneity of graphene on amorphous SiOequation observed in experiments. We found that independent of the considered surface morphologies, the typical electronic structure of graphene in the vicinity of the Dirac point remains unaltered in contact with the SiOequation substrate, which points to the absence of the covalent interactions between graphene and amorphous silica. The case of hydrogen-passivated SiOequation surfaces is also examined. In this situation, the binding with graphene is practically independent of the type of surface defects and arises, as expected, from the vdW interactions.

In this work, bilayer graphene film grown with low pressure chemical vapor deposition was used as a transparent conductor for the first time. The technique was demonstrated to be highly efficient in fabricating a conductive and uniform transparent conductor compared to multi-layer or single layer graphene. Four transfers of bilayer graphene yielded a transparent conducting film with a sheet resistance of 180 letter\square at a transmittance of 83%.

However, this is not the only possibility. Here it is shown that one can reconstruct the theoretical models at the critical points. The new polynomial model of the flux relaxation (vortex penetration) phenomenon was constructed by expanding the vortex activation energy as an infinite series of the current density (internal field) about the critical current density (equilibrium internal field).

The vortex core is found to sit in an interstitial site and a very weak relaxation of the lattice positions away from the vortex core position has been observed. Also other properties like Bragg peaks in the static structure factor or the behavior of vacancies are very little affected by the presence of the vortex. We have computed also the one-body density matrix in perfect and defected 4He crystals finding that the vortex has no sensible effect on the off-diagonal long range tail of the density matrix.

Our results show that all the three sequences successfully enhance the spin coherence by pushing the wave vector of the most unstable mode in the condensate to a larger value. Among the three sequences with the same number of pulses, the concatenated one shows the best performance in preserving the spin coherence. Interestingly, we find that all the three sequences exactly follow the same enhancement law, equation, with equation the wave vector of the most unstable mode, equation the sequence period, and equation a sequence-dependent constant.

The vibration patterns and the symmetries of the qLVMs are presented and analyzed in detail for both ground and excited orbital states of the NV center. We find that in the high-symmetry (equation) excited orbital state a pair of degenerate qLVMs becomes unstable, and the stable excited state has lower (equation) symmetry. This is a direct indication of the Jahn-Teller effect, and our studies suggest that dynamical Jahn-Teller effect in the weak coupling regime takes place.

As an illustration we consider a quasi-one-dimensional fermionic condensate, as realized, e.g., in cigar-shaped atomic Fermi gases or superconducting quantum wires. In this case the transverse quantization of the particle motion favors pairing through a coherent superposition of quantum channels that are formed due to the grouping of single-particle levels into a series of well distinguished subbands.

Based on a mechanism combining Pauli blocking and phase locking between adjacent sites, we construct complete sets of jump operators describing coupling to a reservoir that leads to dissipative preparation of pairing states for fermions with various symmetries in the absence of direct inter-particle interactions. We discuss the uniqueness of these states, and demonstrate it with small-scale numerical simulations. In the late time dissipative dynamics, we identify a ""dissipative gap"" that persists in the thermodynamic limit. This gap implies exponential convergence of all many-body observables to their steady state values. We then investigate how these pairing states can be used as a starting point for the preparation of the ground state of Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian via an adiabatic state preparation process also involving the parent Hamiltonian of the pairing state. We also provide a proof-of-principle example for implementing these dissipative processes and the parent Hamiltonians of the pairing states, based on Yb171 atoms in optical lattice potentials.",11,[],8

Here we use computer simulations to study a two-dimensional model system characterized by a simple isotropic interaction that could be realized with building blocks on the nanoscale. We find that the particles arrange themselves into hexagonal superstructures of twin boundaries whose superlattice vector can be tuned reversibly by changing the temperature. Thermodynamic stability is confirmed by calculating the free energy with a combination of thermodynamic integration and the Frenkel-Ladd method. Different contributions to the free energy difference are discussed.,11,[],8
1103.3191,cond-mat,"Based on a two-band model, we study the electronic Raman scattering intensity in both normal and superconducting states of iron-pnictide superconductors. For the normal state, due to the match or mismatch of the symmetries between band hybridization and Raman vertex, it is predicted that overall equation Raman intensity should be much weaker than that of the equation channel. Moreover, in the non-resonant regime, there should exhibit a interband excitation peak at frequency equation in the equation (equation) channel. For the superconducting state, it is shown that equation-band contributes most to the equation Raman intensity as a result of multiple effects of Raman vertex, gap symmetry, and Fermi surface topology. Both extended equation- and equation-wave pairings in the unfolded BZ can give a good description to the reported equation Raman data [Muschler \em et al., Phys. Rev.

Recently, it has been suggested on the basis of field-cooled resistivity and pulsed field magnetization measurements that the volume collapse in this alloy can be suppressed by the application of magnetic fields. Conversely, our direct diffraction measurements show a robust collapsed phase, which persists in magnetic fields as high as 28 Tesla.

This observation is in sharp contrast with the known Josephson junction behavior where switching current dispersion is expected to scale with the power 2/3. We propose an explanation using a generalized version of Kurkijarvi's theory for the flux stability in rf-SQUID and attribute this anomalous effect to the temperature dependence of the critical current which persists down to low temperatures.,11,[],8

Non-linear behavior was observed in the form of a redshift of the gyrotropic resonance. I.e., when the excitation amplitude was increased, the resonance frequency was found to decrease.

In the AF state the RKKY interaction maps into an effective anisotropic XXZ-type Heisenberg exchange model. The anisotropy originates from the breaking of the spin-rotational symmetry induced by the AF order and its strength depends on the size of the AF gap and the structure of the folded Fermi surface.

To understand how macroscopic rigidity can emerge in this amorphous solid, it is crucial that we understand how Newton's laws pass from the disordered grain scale to the laboratory scale. In this work, we introduce an exact discrete calculus, in which Newton's laws appear as differential relations at the scale of a single grain. Using this calculus, we introduce gauge variables which describe identically force- and torque-balanced configurations. In a first, intrinsic formulation, we use the topology of the contact network, but not its geometry. In a second, extrinsic formulation, we introduce geometry with the Delaunay triangulation. These formulations show, with exact methods, how topology and geometry in a disordered medium are related by constraints. In particular, we derive Airy's expression for a divergence-free, symmetric stress tensor in two and three dimensions.",11,[],8

We present results for the density response function of the 3D homogeneous Hubbard model, and point out a drawback of the linear response scheme based on the linearized Sham-Schluter equation. We then suggest a prescription on how to amend it. Finally, we analyze the time evolution of the density in a small cubic cluster, and compare exact, adiabatic-TDDFT and Kadanoff-Baym-Equations densities.

In the low energy limit, the model turns out to be identical to one describing quasi-one-dimensional superconductivity in condensed matter systems. This opens the possibility of using bosons as a quantum analogue simulator of electronic systems, a scenario arising from the intricate relation between statistics and interactions in quasi-one-dimensional systems.",11,[],8

The mole fraction of the liquid-like regions controls the thermodynamic properties of the supercooled liquid while that of the solid-like regions controls its relaxation time or viscosity. From the universal temperature dependence of the molar excess entropy for the deeply supercooled liquids, we derive the temperature dependence of the mole fraction of the liquid-like regions to obtain the universal temperature dependence of the relaxation time or the viscosity for the deeply supercooled liquids. A central parameter of our model is then shown to be a measure for the fragility of a supercooled liquid.

We find that the two estimates differ by more than 100%. Similar, although smaller discrepancies are found for crystals of hard-sphere colloids and of Lennard-Jones (""argon"") particles. We consider a variety of possible causes for this discrepancy and are forced to conclude that it is due to a finite-size effect that cannot be corrected for by any simple thermodynamic procedure. Importantly, we find that the surface free energies that follow from real nucleation experiments should be subject to large finite size effects. Taking this in to account, we obtain quantitative agreement between the simulation data and the surface free energy of NaCl that follows from nucleation experiments. Our finding suggests that most published solid-liquid surface free energies derived from nucleation experiments will have to be revised.",11,[],8

We show that a substantial part of the total current is caused by the polarization-independent Seebeck ratchet effect. In addition, polarization-dependent photocurrents occur, which we interpret in terms of their underlying microscopical mechanisms.

The algorithms for the computation of the almost-sure winning set for parity objectives iteratively use the solutions for the almost-sure winning set for Buchi objectives (a special case of parity objectives). Our contributions are as follows: First, we present the first subquadratic symbolic algorithm to compute the almost-sure winning set for MDPs with Buchi objectives; our algorithm takes O(n \sqrtm) symbolic steps as compared to the previous known algorithm that takes O(n2) symbolic steps, where equation is the number of states and equation is the number of edges of the MDP. In practice MDPs have constant out-degree, and then our symbolic algorithm takes O(n \sqrtn) symbolic steps, as compared to the previous known equation symbolic steps algorithm. Second, we present a new algorithm, namely win-lose algorithm, with the following two properties: (a) the algorithm iteratively computes subsets of the almost-sure winning set and its complement, as compared to all previous algorithms that discover the almost-sure winning set upon termination; and (b) requires O(n \sqrtK) symbolic steps, where K is the maximal number of edges of strongly connected components (scc's) of the MDP. The win-lose algorithm requires symbolic computation of scc's. Third, we improve the algorithm for symbolic scc computation; the previous known algorithm takes linear symbolic steps, and our new algorithm improves the constants associated with the linear number of steps.

SDGs are often used to model wireless communication networks.   Abu-Affash, Aschner, Carmi and Katz (SWAT 2010, \citeAACK10) showed that for any 2-dimensional Euclidean n-point metric M, the weight of the MST of every connected SDG for M is O(log n) w(MST(M)), and that this bound is tight. However, the upper bound proof of \citeAACK10 relies heavily on basic geometric properties of 2-dimensional Euclidean metrics, and does not extend to higher dimensions. A natural question that arises is whether this surprising upper bound of \citeAACK10 can be generalized for wider families of metrics, such as 3-dimensional Euclidean metrics.   In this paper we generalize the upper bound of Abu-Affash et al. \citeAACK10 for Euclidean metrics of any dimension. Furthermore, our upper bound extends to arbitrary metrics and, in particular, it applies to any of the normed spaces ellp.

In particular, we are interested in quantitative and qualitative restrictions of the way each players payoff depends on moves of other players. We say that a game has small neighborhood if the utility function for each player depends only on (the actions of) a logarithmically small number of other players. The dependency structure of a game G can be expressed by a graph DG(G) or by a hypergraph H(G). By relating Nash equilibrium problems to constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), we show that if G has small neighborhood and if H(G) has bounded hypertree width (or if DG(G) has bounded treewidth), then finding pure Nash and Pareto equilibria is feasible in polynomial time.

1109.2696,cs,"Motivated by multipath routing, we introduce a multi-connected variant of spanners. For that purpose we introduce the equation-multipath cost between two nodes equation and equation as the minimum weight of a collection of equation internally vertex-disjoint paths between equation and equation. Given a weighted graph equation, a subgraph equation is a equation-multipath equation-spanner if for all equation, the equation-multipath cost between equation and equation in equation is at most equation times the equation-multipath cost in equation. The equation factor is called the stretch. Building upon recent results on fault-tolerant spanners, we show how to build equation-multipath spanners of constant stretch and of equation edges, for fixed parameters equation and equation, equation being the number of nodes of the graph. Such spanners can be constructed by a distributed algorithm running in equation rounds. Additionally, we give an improved construction for the case equation. Our spanner equation has equation edges and the equation-multipath cost in equation between any two node is at most twice the corresponding one in equation plus equation, equation being the maximum edge weight.",11,[],7

It is also a complex task with many important methodological decisions to make. Among those, one of the most crucial is the choice of an appropriate measure in order to properly assess the classification performance and rank the algorithms. In this article, we focus on this specific task. We present the most popular measures and compare their behavior through discrimination plots. We then discuss their properties from a more theoretical perspective. It turns out several of them are equivalent for classifiers comparison purposes. Futhermore. they can also lead to interpretation problems. Among the numerous measures proposed over the years, it appears that the classical overall success rate and marginal rates are the more suitable for classifier comparison task.",11,[],7
1103.4071,cs,"We consider the design of efficient algorithms for a multicore computing environment with a global shared memory and p cores, each having a cache of size M, and with data organized in blocks of size B. We characterize the class of `Hierarchical Balanced Parallel (HBP)' multithreaded computations for multicores. HBP computations are similar to the hierarchical divide & conquer algorithms considered in recent work, but have some additional features that guarantee good performance even when accounting for the cache misses due to false sharing. Most of our HBP algorithms are derived from known cache-oblivious algorithms with high parallelism, however we incorporate new techniques that reduce the effect of false-sharing.   Our approach to addressing false sharing costs (or more generally, block misses) is to ensure that any task that can be stolen shares O(1) blocks with other tasks. We use a gapping technique for computations that have larger than O(1) block sharing. We also incorporate the property of limited access writes analyzed in a companion paper, and we bound the cost of accessing shared blocks on the execution stacks of tasks.   We present the Priority Work Stealing (PWS) scheduler, and we establish that, given a sufficiently `tall' cache, PWS deterministically schedules several highly parallel HBP algorithms, including those for scans, matrix computations and FFT, with cache misses bounded by the sequential complexity, when accounting for both traditional cache misses and for false sharing. We also present a list ranking algorithm with almost optimal bounds. PWS schedules without using cache or block size information, and uses knowledge of processors only to the extent of determining the available locations from which tasks may be stolen; thus it schedules resource-obliviously.",11,[],7

1103.5589,cs,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have many potential applications [1, 5] and unique challenges. They usually consist of hundreds or thousands small sensor nodes such as MICA2, which operate autonomously; conditions such as cost, invisible deployment and many application domains, lead to small size and limited resources sensors [2]. WSNs are susceptible to many types of link layer attacks [1] and most of traditional networks security techniques are unusable on WSNs [2]; due to wireless and shared nature of communication channel, untrusted transmissions, deployment in open environments, unattended nature and limited resources [1]. So, security is a vital requirement for these networks; but we have to design a proper security mechanism that attends to WSN's constraints and requirements. In this paper, we focus on security of WSNs, divide it (the WSNs security) into four categories and will consider them, include: an overview of WSNs, security in WSNs, the threat model on WSNs, a wide variety of WSNs' link layer attacks and a comparison of them. This work enables us to identify the purpose and capabilities of the attackers; also, the goal and effects of the link layer attacks on WSNs are introduced. Also, this paper discusses known approaches of security detection and defensive mechanisms against the link layer attacks; this would enable it security managers to manage the link layer attacks of WSNs more effectively.",11,[],7

We learn a classifier that can recognize six basic emotions with an average accuracy of 77% over the Cohn-Kanade database. The novelty of this work is that instead of empirically selecting the parameters of the neural network, i.e. the learning rate, activation function parameter, momentum number, the number of nodes in one layer, etc. we developed a strategy that can automatically select comparatively better combination of these parameters. We also introduce another way to perform back propagation. Instead of using the partial differential of the error function, we use optimal algorithm; namely Powell's direction set to minimize the error function. We were also interested in construction an authentic emotion databases. This is a very important task because nowadays there is no such database available. Finally, we perform several experiments and show that our neural network approach can be successfully used for emotion recognition.",11,[],7

The services are evaluated with relevance assessments from which two important implications emerge: (1) precision values of the retrieval service are the same or better than the tf-idf retrieval baseline and (2) each service retrieved a disjoint set of documents.

In this paper, we weaken this assumption, requiring instead that each duration can be represented by an independent random variable with a known mean and variance. The best solutions are ones which have a high probability of achieving a good makespan. We first create a theoretical framework, formally showing how Monte Carlo simulation can be combined with deterministic scheduling algorithms to solve this problem. We propose an associated deterministic scheduling problem whose solution is proved, under certain conditions, to be a lower bound for the probabilistic problem. We then propose and investigate a number of techniques for solving such problems based on combinations of Monte Carlo simulation, solutions to the associated deterministic problem, and either constraint programming or tabu search. Our empirical results demonstrate that a combination of the use of the associated deterministic problem and Monte Carlo simulation results in algorithms that scale best both in terms of problem size and uncertainty. Further experiments point to the correlation between the quality of the deterministic solution and the quality of the probabilistic solution as a major factor responsible for this success.",11,[],7
1103.3807,cs,"The paper describes a framework for multi-function system testing. Multi-function system testing is considered as fusion (or revelation) of clique-like structures. The following sets are considered: (i) subsystems (system parts or units / components / modules), (ii) system functions and a subset of system components for each system function, and (iii) function clusters (some groups of system functions which are used jointly). Test procedures (as units testing) are used for each subsystem. The procedures lead to an ordinal result (states, colors) for each component, e.g., [1,2,3,4] (where 1 corresponds to 'out of service', 2 corresponds to 'major faults', 3 corresponds to 'minor faults', 4 corresponds to 'trouble free service'). Thus, for each system function a graph over corresponding system components is examined while taking into account ordinal estimates/colors of the components. Further, an integrated graph (i.e., colored graph) for each function cluster is considered (this graph integrates the graphs for corresponding system functions). For the integrated graph (for each function cluster) structure revelation problems are under examination (revelation of some subgraphs which can lead to system faults): (1) revelation of clique and quasi-clique (by vertices at level 1, 2, etc.; by edges/interconnection existence) and (2) dynamical problems (when vertex colors are functions of time) are studied as well: existence of a time interval when clique or quasi-clique can exist.

1111.3244,cs,"In this paper, a fully compressed pattern matching problem is studied. The compression is represented by straight-line programs (SLPs), i.e. a context-free grammars generating exactly one string; the term fully means that both the pattern and the text are given in the compressed form. The problem is approached using a recently developed technique of local recompression: the SLPs are refactored, so that substrings of the pattern and text are encoded in both SLPs in the same way. To this end, the SLPs are locally decompressed and then recompressed in a uniform way.   This technique yields an O((nm)log M) algorithm for compressed pattern matching, assuming that M fits in O(1) machine words, where n (m) is the size of the compressed representation of the text (pattern, respectively), while M is the size of the decompressed pattern.

1111.6082,cs,"In this paper we propose a framework for solving constrained online convex optimization problem. Our motivation stems from the observation that most algorithms proposed for online convex optimization require a projection onto the convex set equation from which the decisions are made. While for simple shapes (e.g. Euclidean ball) the projection is straightforward, for arbitrary complex sets this is the main computational challenge and may be inefficient in practice. In this paper, we consider an alternative online convex optimization problem. Instead of requiring decisions belong to equation for all rounds, we only require that the constraints which define the set equation be satisfied in the long run. We show that our framework can be utilized to solve a relaxed version of online learning with side constraints addressed in \citeDBLP:conf/colt/MannorT06 and \citeDBLP:conf/aaai/KvetonYTM08. By turning the problem into an online convex-concave optimization problem, we propose an efficient algorithm which achieves equation regret bound and equation bound for the violation of constraints. Then we modify the algorithm in order to guarantee that the constraints are satisfied in the long run. This gain is achieved at the price of getting equation regret bound. Our second algorithm is based on the Mirror Prox method \citepnemirovski-2005-prox to solve variational inequalities which achieves equation bound for both regret and the violation of constraints when the domain equation can be described by a finite number of linear constraints. Finally, we extend the result to the setting where we only have partial access to the convex set equation and propose a multipoint bandit feedback algorithm with the same bounds in expectation as our first algorithm.",11,[],7

This method is in response to the need to keep the data secured and to protect the privacy of archived data on the servers, Cloud and Peer-to-Peer architectures. Due to the distributed nature of these architectures, it is impossible to destroy the data completely. So, we store the data by applying encryption and then manage the key, which is easier to do as the key is small and it can be hidden in the DHT (Distributed hash table). Even if the keys in the DHT and the encrypted data were compromised, the data would still be secure.

We examine an asymptotic behavior of this fraction when length equation of formulas tends to infinity. This limit gives a probability measure that randomly chosen BCK formula is also provable in BCI. We prove that this probability tends to zero as the number of variables tends to infinity. The second part of the paper is devoted to the number of lambda terms representing proofs of BCI and BCK logics.

Failures of nodes in cluster computing can be tolerated by multiple fault tolerant computing. Existing recovery schemes are efficient for single fault but not with multiple faults. Recovery scheme proposed in this paper having two phases; sequentially phase, concurrent phase. In sequentially phase, loads of all working nodes are uniformly and evenly distributed by proposed dynamic rank based and load distribution algorithm. In concurrent phase, loads of all failure nodes as well as new job arrival are assigned equally to all available nodes by just finding the least loaded node among the several nodes by failure nodes job allocation algorithm. Sequential and concurrent executions of algorithms improve the performance as well better resource utilization. Dynamic rank based algorithm for load redistribution works as a sequential restoration algorithm and reassignment algorithm for distribution of failure nodes to least loaded computing nodes works as a concurrent recovery reassignment algorithm. Since load is evenly and uniformly distributed among all available working nodes with less number of iterations, low iterative time and communication overheads hence performance is improved.

Reassignments of failure nodes are done by a low overhead efficient failure job allocation algorithm. Test results to show effectiveness of the proposed scheme are presented.",11,[],7
1109.3074,cs,"Traditional heterogeneous parallel algorithms, designed for heterogeneous clusters of workstations, are based on the assumption that the absolute speed of the processors does not depend on the size of the computational task. This assumption proved inaccurate for modern and perspective highly heterogeneous HPC platforms. New class of algorithms based on the functional performance model (FPM), representing the speed of the processor by a function of problem size, has been recently proposed. These algorithms cannot be however employed in self-adaptable applications because of very high cost of construction of the functional performance model. The paper presents a new class of parallel algorithms for highly heterogeneous HPC platforms. Like traditional FPM-based algorithms, these algorithms assume that the speed of the processors is characterized by speed functions rather than speed constants. Unlike the traditional algorithms, they do not assume the speed functions to be given. Instead, they estimate the speed functions of the processors for different problem sizes during their execution. These algorithms do not construct the full speed function for each processor but rather build and use their partial estimates sufficient for optimal distribution of computations with a given accuracy. The low execution cost of distribution of computations between heterogeneous processors in these algorithms make them suitable for employment in self-adaptable applications. Experiments with parallel matrix multiplication applications based on this approach are performed on local and global heterogeneous computational clusters. The results show that the execution time of optimal matrix distribution between processors is significantly less, by orders of magnitude, than the total execution time of the optimized application.",11,[],7

Thus, the automated aid should interactively support effective and timely decision making by the human. We present a domain-independent categorization of the types of alerts a plan-based monitoring system might issue to a user, where each type generally requires different monitoring techniques. We describe a monitoring framework for integrating many domain-specific and task-specific monitoring techniques and then using the concept of value of an alert to avoid operator overload.

One domain (Army small unit operations) has hundreds of mobile, geographically distributed agents, a combination of humans, robots, and vehicles. The other domain (teams of unmanned ground and air vehicles) has a handful of cooperating robots. Both domains involve unpredictable adversaries in the vicinity. Our approach customizes monitoring behavior for each specific task, plan, and situation, as well as for user preferences.

1106.0245,cs,"A major problem in machine learning is that of inductive bias: how to choose a learner's hypothesis space so that it is large enough to contain a solution to the problem being learnt, yet small enough to ensure reliable generalization from reasonably-sized training sets. Typically such bias is supplied by hand through the skill and insights of experts. In this paper a model for automatically learning bias is investigated. The central assumption of the model is that the learner is embedded within an environment of related learning tasks. Within such an environment the learner can sample from multiple tasks, and hence it can search for a hypothesis space that contains good solutions to many of the problems in the environment. Under certain restrictions on the set of all hypothesis spaces available to the learner, we show that a hypothesis space that performs well on a sufficiently large number of training tasks will also perform well when learning novel tasks in the same environment. Explicit bounds are also derived demonstrating that learning multiple tasks within an environment of related tasks can potentially give much better generalization than learning a single task.",11,[],7
1107.5329,cs,"We consider the minimum spanning tree (MST) problem under the restriction that for every vertex v, the edges of the tree that are adjacent to v satisfy a given family of constraints. A famous example thereof is the classical degree-constrained MST problem, where for every vertex v, a simple upper bound on the degree is imposed. Iterative rounding/relaxation algorithms became the tool of choice for degree-bounded network design problems. A cornerstone for this development was the work of Singh and Lau, who showed for the degree-bounded MST problem how to find a spanning tree violating each degree bound by at most one unit and with cost at most the cost of an optimal solution that respects the degree bounds.   However, current iterative rounding approaches face several limits when dealing with more general degree constraints. In particular, when several constraints are imposed on the edges adjacent to a vertex v, as for example when a partition of the edges adjacent to v is given and only a fixed number of elements can be chosen out of each set of the partition, current approaches might violate each of the constraints by a constant, instead of violating all constraints together by at most a constant number of edges. Furthermore, it is also not clear how previous iterative rounding approaches can be used for degree constraints where some edges are in a super-constant number of constraints.   We extend iterative rounding/relaxation approaches both on a conceptual level as well as aspects involving their analysis to address these limitations. This leads to an efficient algorithm for the degree-constrained MST problem where for every vertex v, the edges adjacent to v have to be independent in a given matroid.

1111.2888,cs,"Online learning algorithms that minimize regret provide strong guarantees in situations that involve repeatedly making decisions in an uncertain environment, e.g. a driver deciding what route to drive to work every day. While regret minimization has been extensively studied in repeated games, we study regret minimization for a richer class of games called bounded memory games. In each round of a two-player bounded memory-m game, both players simultaneously play an action, observe an outcome and receive a reward. The reward may depend on the last m outcomes as well as the actions of the players in the current round. The standard notion of regret for repeated games is no longer suitable because actions and rewards can depend on the history of play. To account for this generality, we introduce the notion of k-adaptive regret, which compares the reward obtained by playing actions prescribed by the algorithm against a hypothetical k-adaptive adversary with the reward obtained by the best expert in hindsight against the same adversary. Roughly, a hypothetical k-adaptive adversary adapts her strategy to the defender's actions exactly as the real adversary would within each window of k rounds. Our definition is parametrized by a set of experts, which can include both fixed and adaptive defender strategies.   We investigate the inherent complexity of and design algorithms for adaptive regret minimization in bounded memory games of perfect and imperfect information. We prove a hardness result showing that, with imperfect information, any k-adaptive regret minimizing algorithm (with fixed strategies as experts) must be inefficient unless NP=RP even when playing against an oblivious adversary. In contrast, for bounded memory games of perfect and imperfect information we present approximate 0-adaptive regret minimization algorithms against an oblivious adversary running in time nO(1).",11,[],7

1106.0220,cs,"In many real-world learning tasks, it is expensive to acquire a sufficient number of labeled examples for training. This paper investigates methods for reducing annotation cost by `sample selection'. In this approach, during training the learning program examines many unlabeled examples and selects for labeling only those that are most informative at each stage. This avoids redundantly labeling examples that contribute little new information. Our work follows on previous research on Query By Committee, extending the committee-based paradigm to the context of probabilistic classification. We describe a family of empirical methods for committee-based sample selection in probabilistic classification models, which evaluate the informativeness of an example by measuring the degree of disagreement between several model variants. These variants (the committee) are drawn randomly from a probability distribution conditioned by the training set labeled so far. The method was applied to the real-world natural language processing task of stochastic part-of-speech tagging. We find that all variants of the method achieve a significant reduction in annotation cost, although their computational efficiency differs. In particular, the simplest variant, a two member committee with no parameters to tune, gives excellent results. We also show that sample selection yields a significant reduction in the size of the model used by the tagger.",11,[],7

Moreover, the queries and the schemas have to continually \textitevolve to address business requirements. During such repetitive transitions, the \textitorder of index deployment has to be considered while designing the physical schemas such as indexes and MVs.   An effective index deployment ordering can produce (1) a prompt query runtime improvement and (2) a reduced total deployment time. Both of these are essential qualities of design tools for quickly evolving databases, but optimizing the problem is challenging because of complex index interactions and a factorial number of possible solutions.   We formulate the problem in a mathematical model and study several techniques for solving the index ordering problem. We demonstrate that Constraint Programming (CP) is a more flexible and efficient platform to solve the problem than other methods such as mixed integer programming and A* search.

These combinations can naturally be embedded into C2, the two variable fragment of predicate logic with counting quantifiers, which yields decidability in NExpTime. We show that this approach leads to an optimal solution for ALCQI, as ALCQI with cardinality restrictions has the same complexity as C2 (NExpTime-complete). In contrast, we show that for ALCQ, the problem can be solved in ExpTime. This result is obtained by a reduction of reasoning with cardinality restrictions to reasoning with the (in general weaker) terminological formalism of general axioms for ALCQ extended with nominals. Using the same reduction, we show that, for the extension of ALCQI with nominals, reasoning with general axioms is a NExpTime-complete problem.

Since the energy costs of operating such a large IT infrastructure are a significant fraction of the total operating costs, we argue for redesigning CDNs to incorporate energy optimizations as a first-order principle. We propose techniques to turn off CDN servers during periods of low load while seeking to balance three key design goals: maximize energy reduction, minimize the impact on client-perceived service availability (SLAs), and limit the frequency of on-off server transitions to reduce wear-and-tear and its impact on hardware reliability. We propose an optimal offline algorithm and an online algorithm to extract energy savings both at the level of local load balancing within a data center and global load balancing across data centers. We evaluate our algorithms using real production workload traces from a large commercial CDN. Our results show that it is possible to reduce the energy consumption of a CDN by more than 55% while ensuring a high level of availability that meets customer SLA requirements and incurring an average of one on-off transition per server per day. Further, we show that keeping even 10% of the servers as hot spares helps absorb load spikes due to global flash crowds with little impact on availability SLAs. Finally, we show that redistributing load across proximal data centers can enhance service availability significantly, but has only a modest impact on energy savings.",11,[],7

By considering arbitrary spherical comoving domains, we verify rigorously the fulfillment of these conditions expressed in terms of suitable scalar variables that are evaluated at the boundary of every domain. Effective deceleration necessarily occurs in all domains in: (a) the asymptotic radial range of models converging to a FLRW background, (b) the asymptotic time range of non-vacuum hyperbolic models, (c) LTB self-similar solutions and (d) near a simultaneous big bang. Accelerating domains are proven to exist in the following scenarios: (i) central vacuum regions, (ii) central (non-vacuum) density voids, (iii) the intermediate radial range of models converging to a FLRW background, (iv) the asymptotic radial range of models converging to a Minkowski vacuum and (v) domains near and/or intersecting a non-simultaneous big bang. All these scenarios occur in hyperbolic models with negative averaged and local spatial curvature, though scenarios (iv) and (v) are also possible in low density regions of a class of elliptic models in which local spatial curvature is negative but its average is positive. Rough numerical estimates between -0.003 and -0.5 were found for the effective deceleration parameter. While the existence of accelerating domains cannot be ruled out in models converging to an Einstein de Sitter background and in domains undergoing gravitational collapse, the conditions for this are very restrictive.

Moreover, still considering the asymptotically flat case, the dependence of the gauge transformation parameter in the space-time variables is periodic, just like in the Electromagnetism.

1111.2865,gr-qc,"As established in a prior work of the author, the linear simplicity constraints used in the construction of the so-called `new' spin-foam models mix three of the five sectors of Plebanski theory as well as two dynamical orientations, and this is the reason for multiple terms in the asymptotics of the EPRL vertex amplitude as calculated by Barrett et al. Specifically, the term equal to the usual exponential of equation times the Regge action corresponds to configurations either in sector (II) with positive orientation or sector (II-) with negative orientation. The presence of the other terms beyond this cause problems in the semiclassical limit of the spin-foam model when considering multiple 4-simplices due to the fact that the different terms for different 4-simplices mix in the semi-classical limit, leading in general to a non-Regge action and hence non-Regge and non-gravitational configurations persisting in the semiclassical limit.   To correct this problem, we propose to modify the vertex so its asymptotics include only the one term of the form equation. To do this, an explicit classical discrete condition is derived that isolates the desired gravitational sector corresponding to this one term. This condition is quantized and used to modify the vertex amplitude, yielding what we call the `proper EPRL vertex amplitude.' This vertex still depends only on standard SU(2) spin-network data on the boundary, is SU(2) gauge-invariant, and is linear in the boundary state, as required. In addition, the asymptotics now consist in the single desired term of the form equation, and all degenerate configurations are exponentially suppressed.

We find that greater the value of equation smaller is the number of created particles. We study in detail the spectrum of the total particle number created for equation, with equation, a very small deviation from the standard general relativity case (equation). We find that such a very small deviation causes a great difference in the total particle number, of about one order of magnitude as compared to the standard general relativity. Our calculations are based on the method of instantaneous Hamiltonian diagonalization, where the vacuum states are defined as those which minimizes the energy at a particular instant of time. The spectrum of the total number and total energy of created particles can be determined exactly for any value of the physical time in a matter dominated universe.

On the 3-brane, the test particle moves with uniform velocity, giving the appearance that it is not subject to a force. But computing the particle's energy using the energy-momentum tensor yields a time-dependent energy that suggests a time-dependent mass. Thus, the extra force, which is the effect of the warped extra dimension on the particle's motion on the 3-brane, does not change the velocity but the mass of the particle. The particle's motion in the bulk also results in a time-dependent modification of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle as viewed on the 3-brane. These two results show that the classical physics along the extra dimension results in the time-dependence of particle masses and the uncertainty principle. If the particle masses are time-independent and the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is to remain unchanged, then there must be a non-gravitational force that will restrict all particles on the 3-brane.

We also discuss the behaviour of horizons in ""veiled"" general relativity and show, using this new definition, how to locate cosmological horizons in flat Minkowski space with varying units, which is physically identified with a spatially flat FLRW spacetime.",11,[],13
1101.2132,gr-qc,In this paper we have derived the behavior of deceleration parameter with respect to redshift in context of f(R) gravity in vacuum using Taylor expansion of derivative of action. Here we have obtained that the two first terms in Taylor expansion may describe the late time acceleration which is appeared by SNeIa without need of dark energy and dark matter. Also we have derived that any other terms higher than z in Taylor expansion may describe main inflationary epoch in the early Universe. We have shown that f(R) gravity may cover all the dynamical history of the Universe from the beginning to the late time accelerating phase transition.,11,[],13
1103.4783,gr-qc,"The aims of this letter are two. First, to show the angular gauge-invariance on the response of interferometers to gravitational waves (GWs). In this process, after resuming for completeness results on the Transverse-Traceless (TT) gauge, where, in general, the theoretical computations on GWs are performed, we analyse the gauge of the local observer, which represents the gauge of a laboratory environment on Earth. The gauge-invariance between the two gauges is shown in its full angular and frequency dependences. In previous works in the literature this gauge-invariance was shown only in the low frequencies approximation or in the simplest geometry of the interferometer with respect to the propagating GW (i.e. both of the arms of the interferometer are perpendicular to the propagating GW). Second, as far as the computation of the response functions in the gauge of the local observer is concerned, a common misconception about interferometers is also clarified. Such a misconception purports that, as the wavelength of laser light and the length of an interferometer's arm are both stretched by a GW, no effect should be visible, invoking an analogy with cosmological redshift in an expanding universe.",11,[],13
1112.6391,gr-qc,"We investigate the effects of the underlying quantum geometry in loop quantum cosmology on spacetime curvature invariants and the extendibility of geodesics in the Bianchi-I model for matter with a vanishing anisotropic stress. Using the effective Hamiltonian approach, we find that even though quantum geometric effects bound the energy density and expansion and shear scalars, divergences of curvature invariants are potentially possible under special conditions. However, as in the isotropic models in LQC, these do not necessarily imply a physical singularity. Analysis of geodesics and strength of such singular events, point towards a general resolution of all known types of strong singularities. We illustrate these results for the case of a perfect fluid with an arbitrary finite equation of state equation, and show that curvature invariants turn out to be bounded, leading to the absence of strong singularities. Unlike classical theory, geodesic evolution does not break down. We also discuss possible generalizations of sudden singularities which may arise at a non-vanishing volume, causing a divergence in curvature invariants. Such finite volume singularities are shown to be weak and harmless.",11,[],13

To prevail the deterministic solution we select the scale factor equation which generates a time-dependent deceleration parameter (DP), representing a model which generates a transition of the universe from the early decelerating phase to the recent accelerating phase. We consider the two cases of an interacting and non-interacting two-fluid (barotropic and dark energy) scenario and obtained general results.

1108.3471,gr-qc,"We investigate a trapped surface and naked singularity in a equation-dimensional Vaidya spacetime with a self-similar mass function. A trapped surface is defined as a closed spacelike equation-surface which has negative both null expansions. There is no trapped surface in the Minkowski spacetime. However, in a four-dimensional self-similar Vaidya spacetime, Bengtsson and Senovilla considered non-spherical trapped surfaces and showed that a trapped surface can penetrate into a flat region, if and only if the mass function rises fast enough [I. Bengtsson and J. M. M. Senovilla, Phys. Rev. D \textbf79, 024027 (2009).]. We apply this result to a equation-dimensional spacetime motivated by the context of large extra dimensions or TeV-scale gravity. In this paper, similarly to Bengtsson and Senovilla's study, we match four types of equation-surfaces and show that a trapped surface extended into the flat region can be constructed in the equation-dimensional Vaidya spacetime, if the increasing rate of the mass function is greater than 0.4628.

Complete leading order computations for letter and letter were obtained by Arnold, Moore and Yaffe (AMY) and Arnold, Dogan and Moore (ADM), respectively, with the inelastic processes computed by an effective g <-> gg gluon splitting. We study how complementary calculations with 22 and 23 processes and a simple treatment to model the LPM effect compare with the results of AMY and ADM. We find that our results agree with theirs within errors. By studying the contribution of the 23 process to letter, we find that the minimum angle letter among the final state gluons in the fluid local rest frame has a distribution that is peaked at letter \sim \sqrt\alphas, analogous to the near collinear splitting asserted by AMY and ADM. However, the average of letter is much bigger than its peak value, as its distribution is skewed with a long tail. The same letter behavior is also seen if the 23 matrix element is taken to the soft gluon bremsstrahlung limit in the center-of-mass (CM) frame. This suggests that the soft gluon bremsstrahlung in the CM frame still has some near collinear behavior in the fluid local rest frame.

The effective confining propagator has the form equation and we study the bifurcation equation finding limits on equation below which a satisfactory fermion mass solution is generated. Since the coupling constant and gauge boson propagator are damped in the infrared, due to the presence of dynamically massive gauge bosons, the major part of the chiral breaking is only due to the confining propagator. We study the asymptotic behavior of the gap equation containing confinement and massive gauge boson exchange, and find that the symmetry breaking can be approximated at some extent by an effective four-fermion interaction generated by the confining propagator. We compute some QCD chiral parameters as a function of equation, finding values compatible with the experimental data.

We derive constraints on jet substructure algorithms from factorization, focusing on the broad class of jet observables where the soft and collinear dynamics of QCD dominate. A necessary condition for factorization is that the phase space constraints on soft and collinear dynamics for a given observable are independent of each other. This condition allows us to use a simple power counting analysis to place strong constraints on the form of jet substructure methods that can factorize. We illustrate this approach by considering four substructure algorithms, the mass-drop filter Higgs tagger, pruning, trimming, and N-subjettiness.

1108.2630,hep-ph,"Dark matter trapped in the Sun produces a flux of all flavors of neutrinos, which then reach the Earth after propagating out of the Sun and oscillating from the production point to the detector. The typical signal which is looked at refers to the muon neutrino component and consists of a flux of up-going muons in a neutrino detector. We propose instead a novel signature: the possibility of looking at the tau neutrino component of the dark matter signal, which is almost background-free in the downward-going direction, since the tau neutrino amount in atmospheric neutrinos is negligible and in the down-going baseline atmospheric muon-neutrinos have no time to sizably oscillate. We analyze the prospects of studying the downward-going tau neutrinos from dark matter annihilation (or decay) in the Sun in Cherenkov detectors, by looking at hadronic showers produced in the charged-current tau neutrino interactions and subsequent tau decay. We discuss the various sources of background (namely the small tau neutrino component in atmospheric neutrinos, both from direct production and from oscillations; tau neutrinos from solar corona interactions; the galactic tau neutrino component) as well as sources of background due to misidentification of electron and muon events. We find that the downward-going tau neutrinos signal has potentially very good prospects for Mton scale Cherenkov detectors, the main limitation being the level of misidentification of non-tau events, which need to be kept at level of percent. Several tens of events per year (depending on the dark matter mass and annihilation/decay channel) are potentially collectible with a Mton scale detector, and a 5 sigma significance discovery is potentially reachable for dark matter masses in the range from 20 to 300 GeV with a few years of exposure on a Mton detector.",11,[],2

However, if heavy fourth generation neutrinos are less than half of the Higgs mass, they can dominate the Higgs decay branching fraction, overtaking the standard Higgs to WW* decay rate.

For two-body NLSP decays, the energy spectrum of the visible decay product exhibits a monochromatic line for each sterile sneutrino which can be used to extract the sterile sneutrino masses and some or all entries of the neutrino Yukawa matrix modulo phases. Similar methods can be used to extract these parameters from the Dalitz plot in the case of three-body NLSP decays. Assuming that the sterile sneutrino and neutrino are roughly degenerate, one can confirm the existence of a neutrino seesaw by comparing these measured parameters to the observed active neutrino masses and mixing angles. Seesaw spectroscopy can also provide genuinely new information such as the value of equation, the nature of the neutrino mass hierarchy, and the presence of CP conservation in the neutrino sector. We introduce a weak-scale theory of leptogenesis that can be directly tested by these techniques.",11,[],2

Specifically we consider neutrino mass generation via the Zee--Babu two-loop mechanism, augmented by a scalar singlet whose VEV breaks the global equation symmetry. In order to obtain a Dark Matter candidate we introduce two Standard Model singlet fermions. They form a Dirac particle and are stable because of a remnant equation symmetry. Hence, in this model the stability of Dark Matter follows from the global equation symmetry. We discuss the Dark Matter phenomenology of the model, and compare it to similar models based on gauged equation. We argue that in contrast to the gauged versions, the model based on the global symmetry does not suffer from severe constraints from equation searches.",11,[],2

We employ the pi- and rho-meson Regge trajectories in the t-channel, in addition to the proton- and Delta-pole, in the s- and u-channels respectively, and the contact-interaction contributions. A specific scheme for the form factor which satisfies the Ward-Takahashi identity, crossing symmetry, and on-shell condition, is taken into account. To discuss the validity of the Regge approach within the Effective Lagrangian method, we also consider a smooth interpolation between the Regge- and Feynman-propagators for the t-channel meson exchanges as a function of sqrt(s). We present the numerical results for the energy and angular dependences of the cross sections, and double-polarization observable. It turns out that the present framework shows the significance of the pi-exchange and contact interaction terms to reproduce the experimental data qualitatively well. Especially, the interpolation between the two propagators plays a crucial role to reproduce the high-energy experimental data.

1112.3043,hep-ph,"We define a Higgs descendant equation to be a particle beyond the standard model whose mass arises predominantly from the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs boson. Higgs descendants arise naturally from new physics whose intrinsic mass scale is unrelated to the electroweak scale. The coupling of equation to the Higgs boson is fixed by the mass and spin of equation, yielding a highly predictive setup in which there may be substantial modifications to the properties of the Higgs boson. For example, if the decay of the Higgs boson to equation is kinematically allowed, then this branching ratio is largely determined. Depending on the stability of equation, Higgs decays may result in a variety of possible visible or invisible final states. Alternatively, loops of equation may affect Higgs boson production or its decays to standard model particles. If equation is stable dark matter, then the mandatory coupling between equation and the Higgs boson gives a lower bound on the direct detection cross section as a function of the equation mass. We also present a number of explicit models which are examples of Higgs descendants.

A cross comparison with two sets of transport coefficients supports these findings, illustrating the importance of realistic expansion models for quantitative evaluations of heavy-quark observables in heavy-ion collisions. It also turns out that differences in freeze-out prescriptions and Langevin realizations play a significant role in these variations. Light-quark observables are essential in reducing the uncertainties associated with the bulk-matter evolution, even though uncertainties due to the freeze-out prescription persist.",11,[],2

The application of both a family symmetry group and the canonical see-saw mechanism naturally generates small neutrino masses. The various possibilities from combining these two models are listed.

It establishes the equivalence between a class of observables, which are not necessarily protected by supersymmetry, in strongly coupled ABJM theories away from the planar approximation, with different values of k and N but sharing common kN.

Thus, by suitably adding extra boundary degrees of freedom, the gauge and supersymmetry variations of the boundary theory exactly cancel the boundary terms generated by the variations of the bulk Chern-Simons theory.

This thesis includes a discussion of an algorithm that can be used to generate all brane tilings with any given number of superpotential terms. All tilings with at most 8 superpotential terms have been generated using an implementation of this method.   Orbifolds are a subject of central importance in string theory. It is widely known that there may be two or more orbifolds of a space by a finite group. Abelian Calabi-Yau orbifolds of the form equation can be counted according to the size of the group equation. Three methods of counting these orbifolds will be given.   A brane tiling together with a set of Chern Simons levels is sufficient to define a quiver Chern-Simons theory which describes the worldvolume theory of the M2-brane probe. A forward algorithm exists which allows us to easily compute the toric data associated to the moduli space of the quiver Chern-Simons theory from knowledge of the tiling and Chern-Simons levels. This forward algorithm will be discussed and illustrated with a few examples. It is possible that two different Chern-Simons theories have the same moduli-space. This effect, sometimes known as `toric duality' will be described further.

The target space is demonstrated to be a non-compact hyperkahler manifold restricted to possess a special Killing vector field which generates an SO(2) group of rotations on the two-sphere of complex structures and necessarily leaves one of them invariant. All hyperkahler cones, that is the target spaces of N=2 superconformal sigma models, prove to possess such a vector field that belongs to the Lie algebra of an isometry group SU(2) acting by rotations on the complex structures. A unique property of the N=2 sigma models constructed is that the algebra of OSp(24) transformations closes off the mass shell. We uncover the underlying N=2 superfield formulation for the N=2 sigma models constructed and compute the associated N=2 supercurrent.   We give a special analysis of the most general systems of self-interacting N=2 tensor multiplets in AdS4 and their dual sigma models realized in terms of N=1 chiral multiplets. We also briefly discuss the relationship between our results on N=2 supersymmetric sigma models formulated in the N=1 AdS superspace and the off-shell sigma models constructed in the N=2 AdS superspace in arXiv:0807.3368.",11,[],4
1103.5909,hep-th,We report preliminary results on the recently proposed F-maximization principle in 3D SCFTs. We compute numerically in the large-N limit the free energy on the three-sphere of an N=2 Chern-Simons-Matter theory with a single adjoint chiral superfield which is known to exhibit a pattern of accidental symmetries associated to chiral superfields that hit the unitarity bound and become free. We observe that the F-maximization principle produces a U(1) R-symmetry consistent with previously obtained bounds but inconsistent with a postulated Seiberg-like duality. Potential modifications of the principle associated to the decoupling fields do not appear to be sufficient to account for the observed violations.,11,[],4

1110.4117,hep-th,"We investigate higher spin theories of gravity in three dimensions based on the gauge group SL(N,R)*SL(N,R). In these theories the usual diffeomorphism symmetry is enhanced to include higher spin gauge transformations under which traditional geometric notions of curvature and causality are no longer invariant. This implies, for example, that apparently singular geometries can be rendered smooth by a gauge transformation, much like the resolution of orbifold singularities in string theory. The classical solutions, including the recently constructed higher spin black hole, are characterized by their holonomies around the non-contractible cycles of space-time. The black hole solutions are shown to be gauge equivalent to a BTZ black hole which is charged under a set of U(1) Chern-Simons fields. Nevertheless, depending on the choice of embedding of the gravitational gauge group, the space-time geometry may be non-trivial. We study in detail the N=3 example, where this observation allows us to find a gauge where the black hole geometry takes a simple form and the thermodynamic properties can be studied.",11,[],4

1104.2423,hep-th,"We investigate the structure of the quantum S-matrix for perturbative excitations of the Pohlmeyer reduced version of the AdS5 x S5 superstring following arXiv:0912.2958. The reduced theory is a fermionic extension of a gauged WZW model with an integrable potential. We use as an input the result of the one-loop perturbative scattering amplitude computation and an analogy with simpler reduced AdSn x Sn theories with n=2,3. The n=2 theory is equivalent to the N=2 2-d supersymmetric sine-Gordon model for which the exact quantum S-matrix is known. In the n=3 case the one-loop perturbative S-matrix, improved by a contribution of a local counterterm, satisfies the group factorization property and the Yang-Baxter equation, and reveals the existence of a novel quantum-deformed 2-d supersymmetry which is not manifest in the action. The one-loop perturbative S-matrix of the reduced AdS5 x S5 theory has the group factorisation property but does not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation suggesting some subtlety with the realisation of quantum integrability. As a possible resolution, we propose that the S-matrix of this theory may be identified with the quantum-deformed [psu(22)]2 x R2 symmetric R-matrix constructed in arXiv:1002.1097. We conjecture the exact all-order form of this S-matrix and discuss its possible relation to the perturbative S-matrix defined by the path integral.

We show further that the closed string amplitudes are obtained by gluing two copies of minimal surfaces along their cusped lightlike boundaries. This can be thought of as a manifestation of the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) relation at high energies.

We study in detail the example of a correlator of two concentric circular Wilson loops and a dilaton vertex operator. The resulting expression is given by an integral of combinations of elliptic functions and can be computed analytically in some special limits.

We discuss the classical and the quantum mechanics of a free particle in this framework, and show that they strongly depend on the sign of a coupling constant equation, appearing in the fundamental commutators and proportional to equation. For example, if equation is negative, momenta are bounded. On the contrary, for positive equation, positions and areas are quantized.

When the theory and defect are compactified on a circle, we get a 3d theory with a supersymmetric line operator, corresponding to a hyperholomorphic connection on a vector bundle over a hyperkahler space. The 2d-4d wall-crossing formula can be interpreted as a smoothness condition for this hyperholomorphic connection. We explain how the 2d-4d BPS spectrum can be determined for 4d theories of class S, that is, for those theories obtained by compactifying the six-dimensional (0,2) theory with a partial topological twist on a punctured Riemann surface C. For such theories there are canonical surface defects. We illustrate with several examples in the case of A1 theories of class S.

This naturally defines a ""small"" Hilbert space of untwisted variables. We point out that the cohomology of the reduced differential on this small Hilbert space can be used to describe the states in the untwisted sector, provided certain auxiliary constraints are defined.

One way to reach such a set-up is to start from a generic construction and to make discrete modifications of it which are available only over a subset of the bundle moduli space. Turning on such discrete 'twists' constrains the moduli to the corresponding subset of their moduli space: the twisted bundle has less parametric freedom.

Though the original proof of this result was nonconstructive, several constructive proofs have subsequently been found. Most of these constructive proofs rely on Givens rotations, and none have been shown to be able to produce every example of such a matrix. We introduce a new construction method that is able to do so. This method is based on recent advances in finite frame theory which show how to construct frames whose frame operator has a given prescribed spectrum and whose vectors have given prescribed lengths. This frame construction requires one to find a sequence of eigensteps, that is, a sequence of interlacing spectra that satisfy certain trace considerations. In this paper, we show how to explicitly construct every such sequence of eigensteps. Here, the key idea is to visualize eigenstep construction as iteratively building a staircase. This visualization leads to an algorithm, dubbed Top Kill, which produces a valid sequence of eigensteps whenever it is possible to do so. We then build on Top Kill to explicitly parametrize the set of all valid eigensteps. This yields an explicit method for constructing all self-adjoint matrices with a given spectrum and diagonal, and moreover all frames whose frame operator has a given spectrum and whose elements have given lengths.",11,[],0

Suppose instead a family X of subsets of [n] satisfies X=2(n-1)i for some fixed i>0. Create a new family Xp by choosing each member of X independently with some fixed probability p.

At the end of this first stage of the dynamics the time-averaged modal energy spectrum of the Toda system stabilizes to its final profile, well described, at low energy, by the spectrum of a q-breather. The Toda equilibrium state is clearly shown to describe well the long-living quasi-state of the FPU system. On the long term, the modal energy spectrum of the FPU system slowly detaches from the Toda one by a diffusive-like rising of the tail modes, and eventually reaches the equilibrium flat shape.

We show that the answer to this question is contained in a fundamental result of information theory due to Wyner, Ziv, Ornstein, and Weiss. In particular, for the class of chaotic signals, the upper bound is equation in the limit equation, with equation being entropy in a sense that is explained in the text.   If equation is small for equation, where equation is of the order of a characteristic time scale, the pattern of events leading up to equation is similar to the pattern of events leading up to equation. It is reasonable to expect equation to be a good predictor of equation All existing methods for prediction use this idea in some way or the other. Unfortunately, this intuitively reasonable idea is fundamentally deficient and all existing methods fall well short of the Wyner-Ziv entropy bound on equation. An optimal predictor should decompose the distance between the pattern of events leading up to equation and the pattern leading up to equation into stable and unstable components. A good match should have suitably small unstable components but will in general allow stable components which are as large as the tolerance for correct prediction.

1107.4603,nlin,"We consider the integrable multicomponent coherently coupled nonlinear Schrodinger (CCNLS) equations describing simultaneous propagation of multiple fields in Kerr type nonlinear media. The correct bilinear equations of equation-CCNLS equations are obtained by using a non-standard type of Hirota's bilinearization method and the more general bright one solitons with single hump and double hump profiles including special flat-top profiles are obtained. The solitons are classified as coherently coupled solitons and incoherently coupled solitons depending upon the presence and absence of coherent nonlinearity arising due to the existence of the co-propagating modes/components. Further, by obtaining the more general two-soliton solutions using this non-standard bilinearization approach we demonstrate that the collision among coherently coupled soliton and incoherently coupled soliton displays a non-trivial collision behaviour in which the former always undergoes energy switching accompanied by an amplitude dependent phase-shift and change in the relative separation distance, leaving the latter unaltered. But the collision between coherently coupled solitons alone is found to be standard elastic collision. Our study also reveals the important fact that the collision between incoherently coupled solitons arising in the equation-CCNLS system with equation is always elastic, whereas for equation the collision becomes intricate and for this case the equation-CCNLS system exhibits interesting energy sharing collision of solitons characterized by intensity redistribution, amplitude dependent phase-shift and change in relative separation distance which is similar to that of the multicomponent Manakov soliton collisions. This suggests that the equation-CCNLS system can also be a suitable candidate for soliton collision based optical computing in addition to the Manakov system.",11,[],9

The first uses a pair of differential operators which leads to a higher order linear system for the auxiliary function. The second uses a pair of matrices which leads to a first-order linear system. In this paper we present a method, which is easily implemented in Maple or Mathematica, to compute an operator Lax pair for a set of PDEs.   In the operator representation, the determining equations for the Lax pair split into a set of kinematic constraints which are independent of the original equation and a set of dynamical equations which do depend on it. The kinematic constraints can be solved generically. We assume that the operators have a scaling symmetry. The dynamical equations are then reduced to a set of nonlinear algebraic equations.

The standard deviation of the kinetic energy of an ensemble of initial conditions obeys a power law as a function of time, and saturates after some crossover. Scaling formalism is used in order to characterize the chaotic region close to the transition from integrability to nonintegrability and a relationship between the power law exponents is derived. The formalism can be applied in many different systems with mixed phase space. Then, dissipation is introduced into the model and therefore the property of area preservation is broken, and consequently attractors are observed. We show that after a small change of the dissipation, the chaotic attractor as well as its basin of attraction are destroyed, thus leading the system to experience a boundary crisis. The transient after the crisis follows a power law with exponent -2.",11,[],9
1106.4120,nlin,We develop a mechanism for the controlled conversion of ballistic to diffusive motion and vice versa. This process takes place at the interfaces of domains with different time-dependent forces in lattices of laterally oscillating barrier potentials. As a consequence long-time transient oscillations of the particle density are formed which can be converted to permanent density waves by an appropriate tuning of the driving forces. The proposed mechanism opens the perspective of an engineering of the nonequilibrium dynamics of particles in inhomogeneously driven lattices.,11,[],9

1102.2266,nlin,A new universal \it empirical function that depends on a single critical exponent (acceleration exponent) is proposed to describe the scaling behavior in a dissipative kicked rotator. The scaling formalism is used to describe two regimes of dissipation: (i) strong dissipation and (ii) weak dissipation. For case (i) the model exhibits a route to chaos known as period doubling and the Feigenbaum constant along the bifurcations is obtained. When weak dissipation is considered the average action as well as its standard deviation are described using scaling arguments with critical exponents. The universal \it empirical function describes remarkably well a phase transition from limited to unlimited growth of the average action.,11,[],9

The performance of our strategy with respect to the choice of the initial conditions and the presence of noise in the communication channels is tested by using numerical simulations.

We apply the NLD model to antinucleon interactions in nuclear matter and find a strong decrease of the vector and scalar self-energies in energy and density and thus a strong suppression of the optical potential at zero momentum and, in particular, at FAIR energies.

The purpose of this paper is to address both questions. The theory of the deuteron stripping is developed, which is based on the post continuum discretized coupled channels (CDCC) formalism going beyond of the DWBA and surface integral formulation of the reaction theory [A. S. Kadyrov et al., Ann. Phys. \bf 324, 1516 (2009)]. First, the formalism is developed for the DWBA and then extended to the CDCC formalism, which is ultimate goal of this work. The CDCC wave function takes into account not only the initial elastic equation channel but also its coupling to the deuteron breakup channel equation missing in the DWBA. Stripping to both bound states and resonances are included. The convergence problem for stripping to resonance states is solved in the post CDCC formalism. The reaction amplitude is parametrized in terms of the reduced width amplitudes (ANCs), inverse level matrix, boundary condition and channel radius, that is the same parameters which are used in the conventional equation-matrix method.

All but one of the low-energy constants that enter the calculation were fixed from pion-nucleon and nucleon-nucleon scattering data. The low-energy constant dR (cD), which cannot be determined from the purely two-nucleon data, was extracted recently from the triton beta-decay and the binding energies of the three-nucleon systems. The calculated values of the doublet capture rates show a rather large spread for the used values of the dR. Precise measurement of the doublet capture rate in the future will not only help to constrain the value of dR, but also provide a highly nontrivial test of the nuclear chiral EFT framework. Besides, the precise knowledge of the constant dR will allow for consistent calculations of other two-nucleon weak processes, such as proton-proton fusion and solar neutrino scattering on deuterons, which are important for astrophysics.",11,[],11
1106.4283,nucl-th,"We present a microscopic formalism that extends the traditional formulation of Williams, Ericson and Bloch and permits to obtain the transition strengths (TS) of pre-equilibrium nuclear reactions directly from their quantum microscopic description. We calculate the TS without resorting to the Laplace transform approach and the use of the saddle point approximation. We also analyze some problems that may appear in connection with these mathematical tools and the Darwin-Fowler approach in this case. We show that, analogously to the nuclear densities, the strengths for transitions that change the exciton number by two or leave it unchanged can be estimated microscopically as convolutions of the functions of simpler states. When using the HO basis for the Model Space we obtained important departure from the results of the exciton model (EXM), which can partially invalidate our previous analysis on the attainment of equilibrium during the PE stage. On the other hand, by using constant grid of energies for the sp-basis we were able to reproduce the results of EXM quite well in a large range of excitation energies. A new model code, TRANSNU, was developed that can be ported to traditional semi-classical codes like TNG for nuclear data evaluation.",11,[],11

In this region, simulation and experiment consistently show coherent in-phase fluctuations in density, plasma potential and also in electron temperature. Ion-saturation current measurements turn out to reproduce density fluctuations quite well. Fluctuations in the floating potential, however, are strongly influenced by temperature fluctuations and, hence, are strongly distorted compared to the actual plasma potential. These results suggest that interpreting floating as plasma-potential fluctuations while disregarding temperature effects is not justified near the separatrix of hot fusion plasmas.

We show how, by a proper choice of the expansion coefficients, this ideal can be best approximated. We present a design for a practical electrode geometry based on this analysis. By bending such a deflection field into a circle, a simple storage ring can be created; the direct analog of a weak-focusing cyclotron for charged particles. We show that for realistic parameters a weak-focusing ring is only stable for molecules with a very low velocity. A strong-focusing (alternating-gradient) storage ring can be created by arranging many straight deflection fields in a circle and by alternating the sign of the hexapole term between adjacent deflection fields.

In this work, we develop a flicker noise free frequency measurement system based on a common or shared amplifier. First, we show that correlated flicker phase noise can be cancelled in such a system. Then we compare the new system with the conventional by simultaneously measuring the beat frequency from two cryogenic sapphire oscillators with parts in 1015 fractional frequency instability. We determine for low power, below -80 dBm, the measurements were not limited by correlated noise processes but by thermal noise of the readout amplifier. In this regime, we show that the new readout system performs as expected and at the same level as the standard system but with only half the number of amplifiers.

1108.2006,physics,"As we typically teach in an introductory mechanics course, choosing a ""good"" reference frame with convenient axes may present a major simplification to a problem. Additionally, knowing some conserved quantities provides an extremely powerful problem-solving tool. While the former idea is typically discussed in the context of Newton's Laws, the latter starts with introducing conservation of energy even later.   This work presents an elegant example of implementing both aforementioned ideas in the kinematical context, thus providing a ""warm-up"" introduction to the standard tools used later on in dynamics. Both the choice of the (non-orthogonal) reference frame and the conserved quantities are rather non-standard, yet at the same time quite intuitive to the problem at hand. Two such problems are discussed in detail with two alternative approaches. The first approach does not even require knowledge of calculus.

In addition, a few exercises and another similar problem for students' ""homework"" are provided at the end.",11,[],5

Disorders are induced through controlling the self-assembling process using an electrolyte of specific concentrations. Structural characterization reveals increase in disorder with increase in concentrations of the electrolyte. Reflectivity and transmittance spectra are measured to probe the photonic stop gap at different levels of disorder. With increase in disorder the stop gap is vanished and that results in a fully random photonic nanostructure where the diffuse scattered intensity reaches up to 100%. Our random photonic nanostructure is unique in which all scatters have the same size and shape. We also observe the resonant characteristics in the multiple scattering of light.,11,[],5

1104.1679,physics,"Electron cooling is a well-established method to improve the phase space quality of ion beams in storage rings. In the common rest frame of the ion and the electron beam the ion is subjected to a drag force and it experiences a loss or a gain of energy which eventually reduces the energy spread of the ion beam. A calculation of this process is complicated as the electron velocity distribution is anisotropic and the cooling process takes place in a magnetic field which guides the electrons. In this paper the cooling force is calculated in a model of binary collisions (BC) between ions and magnetized electrons, in which the Coulomb interaction is treated up to second-order as a perturbation to the helical motion of the electrons. The calculations are done with the help of an improved BC theory which is uniformly valid for any strength of the magnetic field and where the second-order two-body forces are treated in the interaction in Fourier space without specifying the interaction potential. The cooling force is explicitly calculated for a regularized and screened potential which is both of finite range and less singular than the Coulomb interaction at the origin. Closed expressions are derived for monochromatic electron beams, which are folded with the velocity distributions of the electrons and ions. The resulting cooling force is evaluated for anisotropic Maxwell velocity distributions of the electrons and ions.",11,[],5
1101.4085,physics,"The production of X-ray radiation with a high degree of circular polarization constitutes an important goal at XFEL facilities. A simple scheme to obtain circular polarization control with crossed undulators has been proposed so far. In its simplest configuration the crossed undulators consist of pair of short planar undulators in crossed position separated by an electromagnetic phase shifter. An advantage of this configuration is a fast helicity switching. A drawback is that a high degree of circular polarization (over 90%) can only be achieved for lengths of the insertion devices significantly shorter than the gain length, i.e. at output power significantly lower than the saturation power level. The obvious and technically possible extension considered in this paper, is to use a setup with two or more crossed undulators separated by phase shifters. This cascade crossed undulator scheme is distinguished, in performance, by a fast helicity switching, a high degree of circular polarization (over 95%) and a high output power level, comparable with the saturation power level in the baseline undulator at fundamental wavelength.

1104.2484,physics,"The concept of microstructure of the real space, considered as a mathematical lattice of cells (the tessel-lattice), and notions of canonical particles and fields, which are generated by the space, are analyzed. Submicroscopic mechanics based on this concept is discussed and employed for in-depth study of the nucleon-nucleon interaction. It is argued that a deformation coat is developed in the real space around the nucleon (as is the case with any other canonical particle such as electron, muon, etc.) and that they are the deformation coats that are responsible for the appearance of nuclear forces. One more source of nuclear forces is associated with inerton clouds, excitations of the space tessel-lattice (the excitations are a substructure of nucleons' matter waves), which accompany moving nucleons as in the case of any other canonical particles. Two nuclear systems are under consideration: the deuteron and a weight nucleus. It is shown that a weight nucleus is a cluster of interacting protons and neutrons. The condition of the cluster stability is obtained in the framework of the statistical mechanical approach.

A relation between stationary soliton solutions of the model and solitons of the discrete nonlinear Schrodinger (DNLS) equation is demonstrated. Approximate solutions for solitons whose width is large in comparison to the lattice spacing are derived, using a continuum counterpart of the discrete equations. These solitons are mobile, featuring nearly elastic collisions. Stationary solutions for narrow solitons, which are immobile due to the pinning by the effective Peierls-Nabarro potential, are constructed numerically, starting from the anti-continuum limit. The solitons with the amplitude exceeding a certain critical value suffer an instability leading to blowup, which is a specific feature of the nonlinear PT-symmetric chain, making it dynamically different from DNLS lattices. A qualitative explanation of this feature is proposed. The instability threshold drops with the increase of the gain-loss coefficient, but it does not depend on the lattice coupling constant, nor on the soliton's velocity.",11,[],5

1111.2331,physics,"Due to the Hubble redshift, photon energy, chiefly in the form of CMBR photons, is currently disappearing from the universe at the rate of nearly 1055 erg s-1. An ongoing problem in cosmology concerns the fate of this energy. In one interpretation it is irretrievably lost, i.e., energy is not conserved on the cosmic scale. Here we consider a different possibility which retains universal energy conservation. If gravitational energy is redshifted in the same manner as photons, then it can be shown that the cosmic redshift removes gravitational energy from space at about the same rate as photon energy. Treating gravitational potential energy conventionally as negative energy, it is proposed that the Hubble shift 'flips' positive energy (photons) to negative energy (gravitons) and vice versa. The lost photon energy would thus be directed towards gravitation, making gravitational energy wells more negative. Conversely, within astrophysical bodies of sufficient size, the flipping of gravitons to photons would give rise to a 'Hubble luminosity' of magnitude -UH, where U is the internal gravitational potential energy of the object and H the Hubble constant. Evidence of such an energy release is presented in bodies ranging from planets, white dwarfs and neutron stars to supermassive black holes and the visible universe.",11,[],5

Inside SPP there is a vicious cycle which is supported by disturbance of production and-or circulation of bile acids. SPP central subprocess is PAMP-nemia, namely chronic kPAMP-load on blood phagocytes (neutrophiles, monocytes and dendritic cells). The load results in increase of blood kPAMP level.

1102.3596,q-bio,"Matrix forms of the representation of the multi-level system of molecular-genetic alphabets have revealed algebraic properties of this system. Families of genetic (4*4)- and (8*8)-matrices show unexpected connections of the genetic system with Walsh functions and Hadamard matrices, which are known in theory of noise-immunity coding, digital communication and digital holography. Dyadic-shift decompositions of such genetic matrices lead to sets of sparse matrices. Each of these sets is closed in relation to multiplication and defines relevant algebra of hypercomplex numbers. It is shown that genetic Hadamard matrices are identical to matrix representations of Hamilton quaternions and its complexification in the case of unit coordinates. The diversity of known dialects of the genetic code is analyzed from the viewpoint of the genetic algebras. An algebraic analogy with Punnett squares for inherited traits is shown. Our results are used in analyzing genetic phenomena. The statement about existence of the geno-logic code in DNA and epigenetics on the base of the spectral logic of systems of Boolean functions is put forward. Our results show promising ways to develop algebraic-logical biology, in particular, in connection with the logic holography on Walsh functions.",11,[],10
1111.6062,q-bio,"The phenomena that emerge from the interaction of the stochastic opening and closing of ion channels (channel noise) with the non-linear neural dynamics are essential to our understanding of the operation of the nervous system. The effects that channel noise can have on neural dynamics are generally studied using numerical simulations of stochastic models. Algorithms based on discrete Markov Chains (MC) seem to be the most reliable and trustworthy, but even optimized algorithms come with a non-negligible computational cost. Diffusion Approximation (DA) methods use Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) to approximate the behavior of a number of MCs, considerably speeding up simulation times. However, model comparisons have suggested that DA methods did not lead to the same results as in MC modeling in terms of channel noise statistics and effects on excitability. Recently, it was shown that the difference arose because MCs were modeled with coupled activation subunits, while the DA was modeled using uncoupled activation subunits. Implementations of DA with coupled subunits, in the context of a specific kinetic scheme, yielded similar results to MC. However, it remained unclear how to generalize these implementations to different kinetic schemes, or whether they were faster than MC algorithms. Additionally, a steady state approximation was used for the stochastic terms, which, as we show here, can introduce significant inaccuracies. We derived the SDE explicitly for any given ion channel kinetic scheme. The resulting generic equations were surprisingly simple and interpretable - allowing an easy and efficient DA implementation. The algorithm was tested in a voltage clamp simulation and in two different current clamp simulations, yielding the same results as MC modeling. Also, the simulation efficiency of this DA method demonstrated considerable superiority over MC methods.",11,[],10
1111.6489,q-bio,"Objectives: Stress hormones have been associated with temporal discounting. Although time-discount rate is shown to be stable over a long term, no study to date examines whether individual differences in stress hormones could predict individuals' time-discount rates in the relatively distant future (e.g., six month later), which is of interest in neuroeconomics of stress-addiction association.   Methods: We assessed 87 participants' salivary stress hormone (cortisol, cortisone, and alpha-amylase) levels and hyperbolic discounting of delayed rewards consisting of three magnitudes, at the time-interval of six months. For salivary steroid assays, we employed a liquid chromatography/ mass spectroscopy (LC/MS) method. The correlations between the stress hormone levels and time-discount rates were examined.   Results: We observed that salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) levels were negatively associated with time-discount rates in never-smokers. Notably, salivary levels of stress steroids (i.e., cortisol and cortisone) negatively and positively related to time-discount rates in men and women, respectively, in never-smokers. Ever-smokers' discount rates were not predicted from these stress hormone levels.   Conclusions: Individual differences in stress hormone levels predict impulsivity in temporal discounting in the future. There are sex differences in the effect of stress steroids on temporal discounting; while there was no sex defference in the relationship between sAA and temporal discounting.",11,[],10

1103.0675,q-bio,"The chemotaxis pathway in the bacterium Escherichia coli allows cells to detect changes in external ligand concentration (e.g. nutrients). The pathway regulates the flagellated rotary motors and hence the cells' swimming behaviour, steering them towards more favourable environments. While the molecular components are well characterised, the motor behaviour measured by tethered cell experiments has been difficult to interpret. Here, we study the effects of sensing and signalling noise on the motor behaviour. Specifically, we consider fluctuations stemming from ligand concentration, receptor switching between their signalling states, adaptation, modification of proteins by phosphorylation, and motor switching between its two rotational states. We develop a model which includes all signalling steps in the pathway, and discuss a simplified version, which captures the essential features of the full model. We find that the noise characteristics of the motor contain signatures from all these processes, albeit with varying magnitudes. This allows us to address how cell-to-cell variation affects motor behaviour and the question of optimal pathway design. A similar comprehensive analysis can be applied to other two-component signalling pathways.",11,[],10
1110.1706,q-bio,"Introduction: Gap junctions play an important role in the cell proliferation in mammalian cells as well as carcinogenesis. However, there are controversial issues about their role in cancer pathogenesis. This study was designed to evaluate genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of Carbenoxolone (CBX) as a prototype of inter-cellular gap junction blocker in MCF7 and BT20 human breast cancer cells. Methods: The MCF7and BT20 human breast cancer cell lines were cultivated, and treated at designated confluency with different doses of CBX. Cellular cytotoxicity was examined using standard colorimetric assay associated with cell viability tests. Gene expression evaluation was carried out using real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: MCF7 and BT20 cells were significantly affected by CBX in a dose dependent manner in cell viability assays. Despite varying expression of genes, down regulation of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes was observed in these cells. Conclusion: Based upon this investigation, it can be concluded that CBX could affect both low and high proliferative types of breast cancer cell lines and disproportionate down regulation of both pre- and anti-apoptotic genes may be related to interacting biomolecules, perhaps via gap junctions.",11,[],10
1102.3739,q-bio,"Understanding design principles of molecular interaction networks is an important goal of molecular systems biology. Some insights have been gained into features of their network topology through the discovery of graph theoretic patterns that constrain network dynamics. This paper contributes to the identification of patterns in the mechanisms that govern network dynamics. The control of nodes in gene regulatory, signaling, and metabolic networks is governed by a variety of biochemical mechanisms, with inputs from other network nodes that act additively or synergistically. This paper focuses on a certain type of logical rule that appears frequently as a regulatory pattern. Within the context of the multistate discrete model paradigm, a rule type is introduced that reduces to the concept of nested canalyzing function in the Boolean network case. It is shown that networks that employ this type of multivalued logic exhibit more robust dynamics than random networks, with few attractors and short limit cycles. It is also shown that the majority of regulatory functions in many published models of gene regulatory and signaling networks are nested canalyzing.",11,[],10
1106.1620,q-bio,"The phenomena of stochasticity in biochemical processes have been intriguing life scientists for the past few decades. We now know that living cells take advantage of stochasticity in some cases and counteract stochastic effects in others. The source of intrinsic stochasticity in biomolecular systems are random timings of individual reactions, which cumulatively drive the variability in outputs of such systems. Despite the acknowledged relevance of stochasticity in the functioning of living cells no rigorous method have been proposed to precisely identify sources of variability. In this paper we propose a novel methodology that allows us to calculate contributions of individual reactions into the variability of a system's output. We demonstrate that some reactions have dramatically different effects on noise than others. Surprisingly, in the class of open conversion systems that serve as an approximate model of signal transduction, the degradation of an output contributes half of the total noise. We also demonstrate the importance of degradation in other relevant systems and propose a degradation feedback control mechanism that has the capability of an effective noise suppression. Application of our method to some well studied biochemical systems such as: gene expression, Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics, and the p53 system indicates that our methodology reveals an unprecedented insight into the origins of variability in biochemical systems. For many systems an analytical decomposition is not available; therefore the method has been implemented as a Matlab package and is available from the authors upon request.",11,[],10
1101.1892,q-bio,"Our empirical modeling suggests that deformation of placental vascular growth is associated with abnormal placental chorionic surface shape. Altered chorionic surface shape is associated with lowered placental functional efficiency.

We find that non-centrality of the umbilical cord insertion is strongly and significantly correlated with disk thickness (Spearman's rho=0.128, p=0.002). Deformed shape is strongly and significantly associated with lower overall thickness and higher variability of thickness with beta between -0.173 and -0.254 (p<0.001) . Both lower mean thickness and high variability of thickness are strongly correlated with higher beta (reduced placental efficiency) (p<0.001 and p=0.038 respectively).

Allosteric signal propagation does not stop at the 'end' of a protein, but may be dynamically transmitted across the cell. Here, we propose that the concept of allosteric drugs can be broadened to allo-network drugs, whose effects can propagate either within a protein, or across several proteins, to enhance or inhibit specific interactions along a pathway. We posit that current allosteric drugs are a special case of allo-network drugs, and suggest that allo-network drugs can achieve specific, limited changes at the systems level, and in this way can achieve fewer side effects and lower toxicity. Finally, we propose steps and methods to identify allo-network drug targets and sites outlining a new paradigm in systems-based drug design.",11,[],10
1107.3278,q-bio,"Most biological processes are described as a series of interactions between proteins and other molecules, and interactions are in turn described in terms of atomic structures. To annotate protein functions as sets of interaction states at atomic resolution, and thereby to better understand the relation between protein interactions and biological functions, we conducted exhaustive all-against-all atomic structure comparisons of all known binding sites for ligands including small molecules, proteins and nucleic acids, and identified recurring elementary motifs. By integrating the elementary motifs associated with each subunit, we defined composite motifs which represent context-dependent combinations of elementary motifs. It is demonstrated that function similarity can be better inferred from composite motif similarity compared to the similarity of protein sequences or of individual binding sites. By integrating the composite motifs associated with each protein function, we define meta-composite motifs each of which is regarded as a time-independent diagrammatic representation of a biological process. It is shown that meta-composite motifs provide richer annotations of biological processes than sequence clusters. The present results serve as a basis for bridging atomic structures to higher-order biological phenomena by classification and integration of binding site structures.",11,[],10
1106.3035,q-bio,"The enteric bacterium Proteus mirabilis, which is a pathogen that forms biofilms in vivo, can swarm over hard surfaces and form concentric ring patterns in colonies. Colony formation involves two distinct cell types: swarmer cells that dominate near the surface and the leading edge, and swimmer cells that prefer a less viscous medium, but the mechanisms underlying pattern formation are not understood. New experimental investigations reported here show that swimmer cells in the center of the colony stream inward toward the inoculation site and in the process form many complex patterns, including radial and spiral streams, in addition to concentric rings. These new observations suggest that swimmers are motile and that indirect interactions between them are essential in the pattern formation. To explain these observations we develop a hybrid cell-based model that incorporates a chemotactic response of swimmers to a chemical they produce. The model predicts that formation of radial streams can be explained as the modulation of the local attractant concentration by the cells, and that the chirality of the spiral streams can be predicted by incorporating a swimming bias of the cells near the surface of the substrate. The spatial patterns generated from the model are in qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.",11,[],10
1110.5980,q-bio,"S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH), a cellular enzyme that plays a key role in methylation reactions including those required for maturation of viral mRNA, is an important drug target in the discovery of antiviral agents. While targeting the active site is a straightforward strategy of enzyme inhibition, evidences of allosteric modulation of active site in many enzymes underscore the molecular origin of signal transduction. Information of co-evolving sequences in SAHH family and the key residues for functional dynamics that can be identified using native topology of the enzyme provide glimpses into how the allosteric signaling network, dispersed over the molecular structure, coordinates intra- and inter-subunit conformational dynamics. To study the link between the allosteric communication and functional dynamics of SAHHs, we performed Brownian dynamics simulations by building a coarse-grained model based on the holo and ligand-bound structures. The simulations of ligand-induced transition revealed that the signal of intra-subunit closure dynamics is transmitted to form inter-subunit contacts, which in turn invoke a precise alignment of active site, followed by the dimer-dimer rotation that compacts the whole tetrameric structure. Further analyses of SAHH dynamics associated with ligand binding provided evidence of both induced fit and population shift mechanisms, and also showed that the transition state ensemble is akin to the ligand-bound state. Besides the formation of enzyme-ligand contacts at the active site, the allosteric couplings from the residues distal to the active site is vital to the enzymatic function.",11,[],10

1101.0687,q-bio,"Nonlinear mixed effects models represent a powerful tool to simultaneously analyze data from several individuals. In this study a compartmental model of leucine kinetics is examined and extended with a stochastic differential equation to model non-steady state concentrations of free leucine in the plasma. Data obtained from tracer/tracee experiments for a group of healthy control individuals and a group of individuals suffering from diabetes mellitus type 2 are analyzed. We find that the interindividual variation of the model parameters is much smaller for the nonlinear mixed effects models, compared to traditional estimates obtained from each individual separately. Using the mixed effects approach, the population parameters are estimated well also when only half of the data are used for each individual. For a typical individual the amount of free leucine is predicted to vary with a standard deviation of 8.9% around a mean value during the experiment. Moreover, leucine degradation and protein uptake of leucine is smaller, proteolysis larger, and the amount of free leucine in the body is much larger for the diabetic individuals than the control individuals. In conclusion nonlinear mixed effects models offers improved estimates for model parameters in complex models based on tracer/tracee data and may be a suitable tool to reduce data sampling in clinical studies.",11,[],10
1111.0097,q-bio,"A neuron transforms its input into output spikes, and this transformation is the basic unit of computation in the nervous system. The spiking response of the neuron to a complex, time-varying input can be predicted from the detailed biophysical properties of the neuron, modeled as a deterministic nonlinear dynamical system. In the tradition of neural coding, however, a neuron or neural system is treated as a black box and statistical techniques are used to identify functional models of its encoding properties. The goal of this work is to connect the mechanistic, biophysical approach to neuronal function to a description in terms of a coding model. Building from preceding work at the single neuron level, we develop from first principles a mathematical theory mapping the relationships between two simple but powerful classes of models: deterministic integrate-and-fire dynamical models and linear-nonlinear coding models. To do so, we develop an approach for studying a nonlinear dynamical system by conditioning on an observed linear estimator. We derive asymptotic closed-form expressions for the linear filter and estimates for the nonlinear decision function of the linear/nonlinear model. We analytically derive the dependence of the linear filter on the input statistics and we show how deterministic nonlinear dynamics can be used to modulate the properties of a probabilistic code. We demonstrate that integrate-and-fire models without any additional currents can perform perfect contrast gain control, a sophisticated adaptive computation, and we identify the general dynamical principles responsible. We then design from first principles a nonlinear dynamical model that implements gain control. While we focus on the integrate-and-fire models for tractability, the framework we propose to relate LN and dynamical models generalizes naturally to more complex biophysical models.",11,[],10

1112.2317,q-bio,"I consider the microscopic mechanisms by which a particular left-right (L/R) asymmetry is generated at the organism level from the microscopic handedness of cytoskeletal molecules. In light of a fundamental symmetry principle, the typical pattern-formation mechanisms of diffusion plus regulation cannot implement the ""right-hand rule""; at the microscopic level, the cell's cytoskeleton of chiral filaments seems always to be involved, usually in collective states driven by polymerization forces or molecular motors. It seems particularly easy for handedness to emerge in a shear or rotation in the background of an effectively two-dimensional system, such as the cell membrane or a layer of cells, as this requires no pre-existing axis apart from the layer normal. I detail a scenario involving actin/myosin layers in snails and in C. elegans, and also one about the microtubule layer in plant cells.

1112.3370,q-bio,"Individual success in group-structured populations has two components. First, an individual gains by outcompeting its neighbors for local resources. Second, an individual's share of group success must be weighted by the total productivity of the group. The essence of sociality arises from the tension between selfish gains against neighbors and the associated loss that selfishness imposes by degrading the efficiency of the group. Without some force to modulate selfishness, the natural tendencies of self interest typically degrade group performance to the detriment of all. This is the tragedy of the commons. Kin selection provides the most widely discussed way in which the tragedy is overcome in biology. Kin selection arises from behavioral associations within groups caused either by genetical kinship or by other processes that correlate the behaviors of group members. Here, I emphasize demography as a second factor that may also modulate the tragedy of the commons and favor cooperative integration of groups. Each act of selfishness or cooperation in a group often influences group survival and fecundity over many subsequent generations. For example, a cooperative act early in the growth cycle of a colony may enhance the future size and survival of the colony. This time-dependent benefit can greatly increase the degree of cooperation favored by natural selection, providing another way in which to overcome the tragedy of the commons and enhance the integration of group behavior. I conclude that analyses of sociality must account for both the behavioral associations of kin selection theory and the demographic consequences of life history theory.",11,[],10
1102.2331,q-bio,"Large scale databases are available that contain homologous gene families constructed from hundreds of complete genome sequences from across the three domains of Life. Here we discuss approches of increasing complexity aimed at extracting information on the pattern and process of gene family evolution from such datasets. In particular, we consider models that invoke processes of gene birth (duplication and transfer) and death (loss) to explain the evolution of gene families. First, we review birth-and-death models of family size evolution and their implications in light of the universal features of family size distribution observed across different species and the three domains of life. Subsequently, we proceed to recent developments on models capable of more completely considering information in the sequences of homologous gene families through the probabilistic reconciliation of the phylogenetic histories of individual genes with the phylogenetic history of the genomes in which they have resided. To illustrate the methods and results presented, we use data from the HOGENOM database, demonstrating that the distribution of homologous gene family sizes in the genomes of the Eukaryota, Archaea and Bacteria exhibit remarkably similar shapes. We shown that these distributions are best described by models of gene family size evolution where for individual genes the death (loss) rate is larger than the birth (duplication and transfer) rate, but new families are continually supplied to the genome by a process of origination. Finally, we use probabilistic reconciliation methods to take into consideration additional information from gene phylogenies, and find that, for prokaryotes, the majority of birth events are the result of transfer.",11,[],10

1107.3443,q-bio,"Calcium currents in neurons and muscle cells have been classified as being one of 5 types of which four, L, N, P/Q and R were said to be high threshold and one, T, was designated low threshold. This review focuses on quantitative aspects of L-type currents. L-type channels are now distinguished according to their structure as one of four main subtypes 1.1-1.4. L-type calcium currents play many fundamental roles in cellular dynamical processes including pacemaking in neurons and cardiac cells, the activation of transcription factors involved in synaptic plasticity and in immune cells. The half-activation potentials of L-type currents have been ascribed values as low as -50 mV and as high as near 0 mV. The inactivation of IL has been found to be both voltage (VDI) and calcium-dependent (CDI) and the latter component may involve calcium-induced calcium release. CDI is often an important aspect of dynamical models of cell electrophysiology. We describe the basic components in modeling IL including activation and both voltage and calcium dependent inactivation and the two main approaches to determining the current. We review, by means of tables of values from over 65 representative studies, the various details of the dynamical properties associated with IL that have been found experimentally or employed in the last 25 years in deterministic modeling in various nervous system and cardiac cells.

We analyzed models of real chemical systems (Martian atmosphere chemistry and various combustion chemistries), bio-chemical systems (gene expression, gene translation, and phosphorylation signaling cascades), as well as an artificial chemistry and random networks. Our study suggests that different chemical systems posses different semantic capacities. Basically no semantic capacity was found in the atmosphere chemistry of Mars and all studied combustion chemistries, as well as in highly connected random networks, i.e., with these chemistries molecular codes cannot be implemented.

1112.3640,q-bio,"During embryonic development in vertebrates, left-right (L/R) asymmetry is reliably generated by a conserved mechanism: a L/R asymmetric signal is transmitted from the embryonic node to other parts of the embryo by the L/R asymmetric expression and diffusion of the TGF-equation related proteins Nodal and Lefty via propagating gene expression fronts in the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) and midline. In zebrafish embryos, Nodal and Lefty expression can only occur along 3 narrow stripes that express the co-receptor \emphone-eyed pinhead (oep): Nodal along stripes in the left and right LPM, and Lefty along the midline. In wild-type embryos, Nodal is only expressed in the left LPM but not the right, because of inhibition by Lefty from the midline; however, bilateral Nodal expression occurs in loss-of-handedness mutants. A two-dimensional model of the zebrafish embryo predicts this loss of L/R asymmetry in oep mutants \citehenley-xu-burdine. In this paper, we simplify this two-dimensional picture to a one-dimensional model of Nodal and Lefty front propagation along the oep-expressing stripes. We represent Nodal and Lefty production by step functions that turn on when a linear function of Nodal and Lefty densities crosses a threshold.

Towards achieving our aim of identification of targets specific to SBC, we constructed a 'Cancer Genes Network', a representative protein interactome of cancer genes. Using graph theoretical methods, we obtained a set of key genes that are relevant for generic mechanisms of cancers and have a role in biological essentiality. We also compiled a curated dataset of 391 SBC genes from published literature which serves as a basis of ontological correlates of secondary bone cancer. Building on these results, we implement a strategy based on generic cancer genes, SBC genes and gene ontology enrichment method, to obtain a set of targets that are specific to bone metastasis. Through this study, we present an approach for probing one of the major complications in cancers, namely, metastasis. The results on genes that play generic roles in cancer phenotype, obtained by network analysis of 'Cancer Genes Network', have broader implications in understanding the role of molecular regulators in mechanisms of cancers. Specifically, our study provides a set of potential targets that are of ontological and regulatory relevance to secondary bone cancer.",11,[],10
1103.5488,q-bio,"An integro-differential equation on a tree graph is used to model the evolution and spatial distribution of a population of organisms in a river network. Individual organisms become mobile at a constant rate, and disperse according to an advection-diffusion process with coefficients that are constant on the edges of the graph. Appropriate boundary conditions are imposed at the outlet and upstream nodes of the river network. The local rates of population growth/decay and that by which the organisms become mobile, are assumed constant in time and space. Imminent extinction of the population is understood as the situation whereby the zero solution to the integro-differential equation is stable. Lower and upper bounds for the eigenvalues of the dispersion operator, and related Sturm-Liouville problems are found, and therefore sufficient conditions for imminent extinction are given in terms of the physical variables of the problem.",11,[],10

This paper proposes a possible link between economic theory of addiction (Becker and Murphy, 1988) and neurobiological theory of bidirectional synaptic plasticity (Bienenstock, Cooper, Munro, 1982) based on recent findings in neuroeconomics and neurobiology of addiction. Furthermore, it is suggested that several neurobiological substrates such as cortisol (a stress hormone), NMDA and AMPA receptors/subunits and intracellular calcium in the postsynaptic neurons are critical factors determining parameters in Becker and Murphy's economic theory of addiction. Future directions in the application of the theory to studies in neuroeconomics and neuropsychiatry of addiction and its relation to stress at the molecular level are discussed.",11,[],10
1112.1393,q-bio,"We investigate the possibility that prebiotic homochirality can be achieved exclusively through chiral-selective reaction rate parameters without any other explicit mechanism for chiral bias. Specifically, we examine an open network of polymerization reactions, where the reaction rates can have chiral-selective values. The reactions are neither autocatalytic nor do they contain explicit enantiomeric cross-inhibition terms. We are thus investigating how rare a set of chiral-selective reaction rates needs to be in order to generate a reasonable amount of chiral bias. We quantify our results adopting a statistical approach: varying both the mean value and the rms dispersion of the relevant reaction rates, we show that moderate to high levels of chiral excess can be achieved with fairly small chiral bias, below 10%. Considering the various unknowns related to prebiotic chemical networks in early Earth and the dependence of reaction rates to environmental properties such as temperature and pressure variations, we argue that homochirality could have been achieved from moderate amounts of chiral selectivity in the reaction rates.",11,[],10
1103.2605,q-bio,"Most neurons in the primary visual cortex initially respond vigorously when a preferred stimulus is presented, but adapt as stimulation continues. The functional consequences of adaptation are unclear. Typically a reduction of firing rate would reduce single neuron accuracy as less spikes are available for decoding, but it has been suggested that on the population level, adaptation increases coding accuracy. This question requires careful analysis as adaptation not only changes the firing rates of neurons, but also the neural variability and correlations between neurons, which affect coding accuracy as well. We calculate the coding accuracy using a computational model that implements two forms of adaptation: spike frequency adaptation and synaptic adaptation in the form of short-term synaptic plasticity. We find that the net effect of adaptation is subtle and heterogeneous. Depending on adaptation mechanism and test stimulus, adaptation can either increase or decrease coding accuracy. We discuss the neurophysiological and psychophysical implications of the findings and relate it to published experimental data.",11,[],10
1111.6573,q-bio,"A key step in many perceptual decision tasks is the integration of sensory inputs over time, but fundamental questions remain about how this is accomplished in neural circuits. One possibility is to balance decay modes of membranes and synapses with recurrent excitation. To allow integration over long timescales, however, this balance must be precise; this is known as the fine tuning problem. The need for fine tuning can be overcome via a ratchet-like mechanism, in which momentary inputs must be above a preset limit to be registered by the circuit. The degree of this ratcheting embodies a tradeoff between sensitivity to the input stream and robustness against parameter mistuning.   The goal of our study is to analyze the consequences of this tradeoff for decision making performance. For concreteness, we focus on the well-studied random dot motion discrimination task. For stimulus parameters constrained by experimental data, we find that loss of sensitivity to inputs has surprisingly little cost for decision performance. This leads robust integrators to performance gains when feedback becomes mistuned. Moreover, we find that substantially robust and mistuned integrator models remain consistent with chronometric and accuracy functions found in experiments. We explain our findings via sequential analysis of the momentary and integrated signals, and discuss their implication: robust integrators may be surprisingly well-suited to subserve the basic function of evidence integration in many cognitive tasks.",11,[],10

We demonstrate that in the case of sufficiently large community size and community number, if the imitation strength within community is weak, i.e., an individual imitates another one in the same community almost randomly, cooperation as well as punishment are more abundant than defection in the long run; if the imitation strength between communities is strong, i.e., the more successful strategy in two individuals from distinct communities is always imitated, cooperation and punishment are also more abundant. However, when both of the two imitation intensities are strong, defection becomes the most abundant strategy in the population.

Conceptually, the economics of efficient allocation and the game-like processes of strategy are well understood in biology; we find the same essential processes in many successful theories of human sociality. Historically, the trace of biological evolution informs in two ways. First, the evolutionary transformations in biological cooperation provide insight into how economic and strategic processes play out over time--a source of analogy that, when applied thoughtfully, aids analysis of human sociality. Second, humans arose from biological history--a factual account of the past that tells us much about the material basis of human behavior.",11,[],10
1103.2382,q-bio,"Animals learn the timing between consecutive events very easily. Their precision is usually proportional to the interval to time (Weber's law for timing). Most current timing models either require a central clock and unbounded accumulator or whole pre-defined populations of delay lines, decaying traces or oscillators to represent elapsing time. Current adaptive recurrent neural networks fail at learning to predict the timing of future events (the 'when') in a realistic manner. In this paper, we present a new model of interval timing, based on simple temporal integrators, derived from drift-diffusion models. We develop a simple geometric rule to learn 'when' instead of 'what'. We provide an analytical proof that the model can learn inter-event intervals in a number of trials independent of the interval size and that the temporal precision of the system is proportional to the timed interval. This new model uses no clock, no gradient, no unbounded accumulators, no delay lines, and has internal noise allowing generations of individual trials. Three interesting predictions are made.",11,[],10
1107.2223,q-bio,"Of the major deuterostome groups, the echinoderms with their multiple forms and complex development are arguably the most mysterious. Although larval echinoderms are bilaterally symmetric, the adult body seems to abandon the larval body plan and to develop independently a new structure with different symmetries. The prevalent pentamer structure, the asymmetry of Loven's rule and the variable location of the periproct and madrepore present enormous difficulties in homologizing structures across the major clades, despite the excellent fossil record. This irregularity in body forms seems to place echinoderms outside the other deuterostomes. Here I propose that the predominant five-ray structure is derived from a hexamer structure that is grounded directly in the structure of the bilaterally symmetric larva. This hypothesis implies that the adult echinoderm body can be derived directly from the larval bilateral symmetry and thus firmly ranks even the adult echinoderms among the bilaterians. In order to test the hypothesis rigorously, a model is developed in which one ray is missing between rays IV-V (Loven's schema) or rays C-D (Carpenter's schema). The model is used to make predictions, which are tested and verified for the process of metamorphosis and for the morphology of recent and fossil forms. The theory provides fundamental insight into the M-plane and the Ubisch', Loven's and Carpenter's planes and generalizes them for all echinoderms. The theory also makes robust predictions about the evolution of the pentamer structure and its developmental basis. *** including corrections (see footnotes) ***",11,[],10
1112.2013,q-bio,"Mitochondrial hypervariable region I genetic data from ancient populations at two sites from Asia, Linzi in Shandong (northern China) and Egyin Gol in Mongolia, were reanalyzed to detect population affinities. Data from a total of 51 modern populations were used to generate distance measures (Fst's) to the two ancient populations. The tests first analyzed relationships at the regional level, and then compiled the top regional matches for an overall comparison to the two probe populations. The reanalysis showed that the Egyin Gol and Linzi populations have clear distinctions in genetic affinity. The Egyin Gol population as a whole appears to bear close affinities with modern populations of northern East Asia. The Linzi population does seem to have some genetic affinities with the West as suggested by the original analysis, though the original attribution of ""European-like"" seems to be misleading. This study suggests that the Linzi individuals are potentially related to early Iranians, who are thought to have been widespread in parts of Central Eurasia and the steppe regions in the first millennium BC, though some significant admixture between a number of populations of varying origin cannot be ruled out.

The heterogeneous weight distribution and multi-scale activity of intermediary networks affects the diffusion, proliferation and extinction of epidemics. Here, we constructed a dual-weighted VTN with 118 major countries and territories from FAO 2008 statistic data about global vegetation production and trade, and develop a reaction-diffusion model to simulate the epidemic behaviors in through VTN. We found an emerged asymmetric threshold of epidemic on VTN, in which local proliferation within nodes plays a more critical role than global diffusion in spreading of EHEC-like diseases, i.e. sufficient local proliferation is the precondition for global diffusion. We also found that a strong modularity on VTN structure, which restricts the spreading of EHEC-like diseases; however, within the communities, the diffusion is quick and easy. There is, moreover, a critical ""epidemic stem"", in which a serial of positive feedback loop for amplifying the proliferation and diffusion pathogens has been identified from entire VTN. Surprisingly, statistical analysis shows a well consistency between theoretical composition of stem and actual pattern of EHEC. The results provide a chance to design gradient control strategies for controlling disease global diffusion.

1108.4951,q-bio,"The ubiquity of modules in biological networks may result from an evolutionary benefit of a modular organization. For instance, modularity may increase the rate of adaptive evolution, because modules can be easily combined into new arrangements that may benefit their carrier. Conversely, modularity may emerge as a by-product of some trait. We here ask whether this last scenario may play a role in genome-scale metabolic networks that need to sustain life in one or more chemical environments. For such networks, we define a network module as a maximal set of reactions that are fully coupled, i.e., whose fluxes can only vary in fixed proportions. This definition overcomes limitations of purely graph based analyses of metabolism by exploiting the functional links between reactions. We call a metabolic network viable in a given chemical environment if it can synthesize all of an organism's biomass compounds from nutrients in this environment. An organism's metabolism is highly versatile if it can sustain life in many different chemical environments. We here ask whether versatility affects the modularity of metabolic networks.",11,[],10
1112.1679,q-bio,"We analyse metapopulation dynamics in terms of an individual-based, stochastic model of a finite metapopulation. We suggest a new approach, using the number of patches in the population as a large parameter. This approach does not require that the number of individuals per patch is large, neither is it necessary to assume a time-scale separation between local population dynamics and migration. Our approach makes it possible to accurately describe the dynamics of metapopulations consisting of many small patches. We focus on metapopulations on the brink of extinction. We estimate the time to extinction and describe the most likely path to extinction. We find that the logarithm of the time to extinction is proportional to the product of two vectors, a vector characterising the distribution of patch population sizes in the quasi-steady state, and a vector -- related to Fisher's reproduction vector -- that quantifies the sensitivity of the quasi-steady state distribution to demographic fluctuations. We compare our analytical results to stochastic simulations of the model, and discuss the range of validity of the analytical expressions. By identifying fast and slow degrees of freedom in the metapopulation dynamics, we show that the dynamics of large metapopulations close to extinction is approximately described by a deterministic equation originally proposed by Levins (1969). We were able to compute the rates in Levins' equation in terms of the parameters of our stochastic, individual-based model. It turns out, however, that the interpretation of the dynamical variable depends strongly on the intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity of the patches. Only when the growth rate and the carrying capacity are large does the slow variable correspond to the number of patches, as envisaged by Levins. Last but not least, we discuss how our findings relate to other, widely used metapopulation models.",11,[],10

Such models need to cover multiple scales, from molecular pathways in cell-autonomous immunity and intercellular communication pathways in tissue inflammation to whole organism response pathways in systemic disease. Here, we highlight the potential of in silico macrophage modeling as an amenable and important yet under-exploited tool in aiding in our understanding of the immune inflammatory response.

1103.5917,q-bio,"Theories to explain the prevalence of sex and recombination have long been a central theme of evolutionary biology. Yet despite decades of attention dedicated to the evolution of sex and recombination, the widespread pattern of sex-differences in the recombination rate is not well understood and has received relatively little theoretical attention. Here, we argue that female meiotic drivers - alleles that increase in frequency by exploiting the asymmetric cell division of oogenesis - present a potent selective pressure favoring the modification of the female recombination rate. Because recombination plays a central role in shaping patterns of variation within and among dyads, modifiers of the female recombination rate can function as potent suppressors or enhancers of female meiotic drive. We show that when female recombination modifiers are unlinked to female drivers, recombination modifiers that suppress harmful female drive can spread. By contrast, a recombination modifier tightly linked to a driver can increase in frequency by enhancing female drive. Our results predict that rapidly evolving female recombination rates, particularly around centromeres, should be a common outcome of meiotic drive. We discuss how selection to modify the efficacy of meiotic drive may contribute to commonly observed patterns of sex-differences in recombination.",11,[],10
1101.3215,q-bio,"Biophysical models are often populated by a large number of input parameters that are difficult to predict or measure experimentally. The validity and robustness of a given model can be evaluated by a sensitivity test to its input parameters. In this study, we performed local (based on a Taylor-like method) and global sensitivity (based on Monte Carlo filtering techniques) analyses of a previously derived PAR1-mediated activation model of endothelial cells. This activation model previously demonstrated that peptide-activated PAR1 has a different receptor/G-protein binding affinity that favors Galphaq activation over Galpha12/13 by approximately 800-fold. Interestingly, the present study shows that the parameter regulating the binding rate of activated PAR1 to Galpha12/13 is indeed important to obtain the expected RhoGTP response. Moreover, we show that the parameters representing the rate of PAR1 deactivation and the rate of PAR1 binding to Gq, are the most important parameters in the system. Finally, we illustrate that the kinetic model considered in this study is robust and we provide complementary insights into the biological meaning and importance of its kinetic parameters.",11,[],10
1112.2933,q-bio,"Background. Organisms use a variety of mechanisms to protect themselves against perturbations. For example, repair mechanisms fix damage, feedback loops keep homeostatic systems at their setpoints, and biochemical filters distinguish signal from noise. Such buffering mechanisms are often discussed in terms of robustness, which may be measured by reduced sensitivity of performance to perturbations. Methodology/Principal Findings. I use a mathematical model to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of robustness in order to understand aspects of organismal design by natural selection. I focus on two characters: one character performs an adaptive task; the other character buffers the performance of the first character against perturbations. Increased perturbations favor enhanced buffering and robustness, which in turn decreases sensitivity and reduces the intensity of natural selection on the adaptive character. Reduced selective pressure on the adaptive character often leads to a less costly, lower performance trait. Conclusions/Significance. The paradox of robustness arises from evolutionary dynamics: enhanced robustness causes an evolutionary reduction in the adaptive performance of the target character, leading to a degree of maladaptation compared to what could be achieved by natural selection in the absence of robustness mechanisms. Over evolutionary time, buffering traits may become layered on top of each other, while the underlying adaptive traits become replaced by cheaper, lower performance components. The paradox of robustness has widespread implications for understanding organismal design.",11,[],10
1104.2845,q-bio,"Bistability plays a central role in the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) controlling many essential biological functions, including cellular differentiation and cell cycle control. However, establishing the network topologies that can exhibit bistability remains a challenge, in part due to the exceedingly large variety of GRNs that exist for even a small number of components. We begin to address this problem by employing chemical reaction network theory in a comprehensive in silico survey to determine the capacity for bistability of more than 40,000 simple networks that can be formed by two transcription factor-coding genes and their associated proteins (assuming only the most elementary biochemical processes). We find that there exist reaction rate constants leading to bistability in ~90% of these GRN models, including several circuits that do not contain any of the TF cooperativity commonly associated with bistable systems, and the majority of which could only be identified as bistable through an original subnetwork-based analysis. A topological sorting of the two-gene family of networks based on the presence or absence of biochemical reactions reveals eleven minimal bistable networks (i.e., bistable networks that do not contain within them a smaller bistable subnetwork). The large number of previously unknown bistable network topologies suggests that the capacity for switch-like behavior in GRNs arises with relative ease and is not easily lost through network evolution. To highlight the relevance of the systematic application of CRNT to bistable network identification in real biological systems, we integrated publicly available protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction, and gene expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and identified several GRNs predicted to behave in a bistable fashion.",11,[],10

How the brain mediates perceptions, creates thoughts, stores memories and initiates actions remains one of the most profound puzzles in biology, if not all of science. A key to a mechanistic understanding of how the nervous system works is the ability to analyze the dynamics of neuronal networks in the living organism in the context of sensory stimulation and behaviour. Dynamic brain properties have been fairly well characterized on the microscopic level of individual neurons and on the macroscopic level of whole brain areas largely with the help of various electrophysiological techniques. However, our understanding of the mesoscopic level comprising local populations of hundreds to thousands of neurons (so called 'microcircuits') remains comparably poor. In large parts, this has been due to the technical difficulties involved in recording from large networks of neurons with single-cell spatial resolution and near- millisecond temporal resolution in the brain of living animals. In recent years, two-photon microscopy has emerged as a technique which meets many of these requirements and thus has become the method of choice for the interrogation of local neural circuits.

Here we clarify that calibration densities, such as those defined in BEAST 1.5, do not represent the marginal prior distribution of the calibration node. We illustrate this with a number of analytical results on small trees. We also describe an alternative construction for a calibrated Yule prior on trees that allows direct specification of the marginal prior distribution of the calibrated divergence time, with or without the restriction of monophyly. This method requires the computation of the Yule prior conditional on the height of the divergence being calibrated. Unfortunately, a practical solution for multiple calibrations remains elusive.

Here we introduce a new computational method for addressing this problem called Inference of Natural Selection from Interspersed Genomically coHerent elemenTs (INSIGHT). INSIGHT uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymorphism and divergence in the elements of interest with those in flanking neutral sites, pooling weak information from many short elements in a manner that accounts for variation among loci in mutation rates and genealogical backgrounds. The method is able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and positive selection based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism and divergence. Information about divergence is obtained from multiple outgroup genomes using a full phylogenetic model. The model is efficiently fitted to genome-wide data by decomposing the maximum likelihood estimation procedure into three straightforward stages. The key selection-related parameters are estimated by expectation maximization. Using simulations, we show that INSIGHT can accurately estimate several parameters of interest even in complex demographic scenarios.

1101.5222,quant-ph,"The auxiliary field method is a new technique to obtain closed formulae for the solutions of eigenequations in quantum mechanics. The idea is to replace a Hamiltonian equation for which analytical solutions are not known by another one equation, including one or more auxiliary fields. For instance, a potential equation not solvable is replaced by another one equation more familiar, or a semirelativistic kinetic part is replaced by an equivalent nonrelativistic one. The approximation comes from the replacement of the auxiliary fields by pure real constants. The approximant solutions for equation, eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, are then obtained by the solutions of equation in which the auxiliary parameters are eliminated by an extremization procedure for the eigenenergies. If equation and if equation is a power law, the approximate eigenvalues can be written equation, where the mean impulsion equation is a function of the mean distance equation and where equation is determined by an equation which is linked to the generalized virial theorem. The general properties of the method are studied and the connections with the envelope theory presented. This method is first applied to nonrelativistic and semirelativistic two-body systems, with a great variety of potentials.

The separable condition associated with this state-overlap determines the strength of the EPR-like correlation on a coherent-state basis in order that the state is entangled.

Specifically, we identify an experimentally realizable region where the system's behavior differs strongly from that of a BEC in a Fabry-P\'erot cavity, and also where quantum corrections become significant.

For these the Stark effect is second-order, so a sizable external electric field is required to produce the requisite dipole moments in the laboratory frame. Here we consider use of polar symmetric top molecules. These offer advantages resulting from a first-order Stark effect, which renders the effective dipole moments nearly independent of the field strength. That permits use of much lower external field strengths for addressing sites. Moreover, for a particular choice of qubits, the electric dipole interactions become isomorphous with NMR systems for which many techniques enhancing logic gate operations have been developed. Also inviting is the wider chemical scope, since many symmetric top organic molecules provide options for auxiliary storage qubits in spin and hyperfine structure or in internal rotation states.",11,[],6

This mode selection takes advantage of the clustering effect, due to the intrinsic dispersion of the nonlinear material. In combination with a CW laser and fast detection, our approach provides a means to engineer a source that can efficiently generate pure photons, without filtering, that is compatible with long distance quantum communication. Furthermore, it is extremely flexible and could easily be adapted to a wide variety of wavelengths and applications.",11,[],6
1109.6530,quant-ph,"We present a quantum optics formalism to study intensity power broadening of a semiconductor quantum dot interacting with an acoustic phonon bath and a high equation microcavity. Power broadening is investigated using a time-convolutionless master equation in the polaron frame which allows for a nonperturbative treatment of the interaction of the quantum dot with the phonon reservoir. We calculate the full non-Lorentzian photoluminescence (PL) lineshapes and numerically extract the intensity linewidths of the quantum dot exciton and the cavity mode as a function of pump rate and temperature. For increasing field strengths, multiphonon and multiphoton effects are found to be important, even for phonon bath temperatures as low as 4 K. We show that the interaction of the quantum dot with the phonon reservoir introduces pronounced features in the power broadened PL lineshape, enabling one to observe clear signatures of electron-phonon scattering. The PL lineshapes from cavity pumping and exciton pumping are found to be distinctly different, primarily since the latter is excited through the exciton-phonon reservoir. To help explain the underlying physics of phonon scattering on the power broadened lineshape, an effective phonon Lindblad master equation derived from the full time-convolutionless master equation is introduced; we identify and calculate distinct Lindblad scattering contributions from electron-phonon interactions, including effects such as excitation-induced dephasing, incoherent exciton excitation and exciton-cavity feeding. Our effective phonon master equation is shown to reproduce the full intensity PL and the phonon-coupling effects very well, suggesting that its general Lindblad form may find widespread use in semiconductor cavity-QED.",11,[],6

1102.0770,quant-ph,"The local Hamiltonian problem plays the equivalent role of SAT in quantum complexity theory. Understanding the complexity of the intermediate case in which the constraints are quantum but all local terms in the Hamiltonian commute, is of importance for conceptual, physical and computational complexity reasons. Bravyi and Vyalyi showed in 2003, using a clever application of the representation theory of C*-algebras, that if the terms in the Hamiltonian are all two-local, the problem is in NP, and the entanglement in the ground states is local. The general case remained open since then. In this paper we extend the results of Bravyi and Vyalyi beyond the two-local case, to the case of three-qubit interactions. We then extend our results even further, and show that NP verification is possible for three-wise interaction between qutrits as well, as long as the interaction graph is embedded on a planar lattice, or more generally, ""Nearly Euclidean"" (NE). The proofs imply that in all such systems, the entanglement in the ground states is local. These extensions imply an intriguing sharp transition phenomenon in commuting Hamiltonian systems: 3-local NE systems based on qubits and qutrits cannot be used to construct Topological order, as their entanglement is local, whereas for higher dimensional qudits, or for interactions of at least 4 qudits, Topological Order is already possible, via Kitaev's Toric Code construction. We thus conclude that Kitaev's Toric Code construction is optimal for deriving topological order based on commuting Hamiltonians.",11,[],6
1110.4959,quant-ph,"Raman scattering from a great number of phonon modes is described from a quantum-statistical point of view within the standing-wave model. The master equation for the completely quantum case, including laser pump depletion and stochastic coupling of Stokes and anti-Stokes modes, is derived and converted to classical equations: either into a generalized Fokker-Planck equation and an equation of motion for the characteristic function or into the master equation in Fock representation. These two approaches are developed both in linear and nonlinear regime. A detailed analysis of scattering into Stokes and anti-Stokes modes in linear regime, i.e., under parametric approximation, is presented. The existence of s-parametrized quasiprobability distributions, in particular the Glauber-Sudarshan P-function, is investigated. An analysis of Raman scattering into separate Stokes and anti-Stokes modes in nonlinear regime, thus including pump depletion, is given. The master equation in Fock representation is solved exactly for the complete density matrix using the Laplace transform method. Short-time solutions, steady-state solutions and approximate compact form solutions are obtained. Relations between the quasidistribution approach based on the Fokker-Planck equation and the density matrix approach based on the master equation in Fock representation are presented. The photocount distribution and its factorial moments as well as variances and extremal variances of quadratures are calculated in both approaches giving the basis for the analysis of the quantum properties of radiation such as sub-Poissonian photon-counting statistics and squeezing.

We note that the HUP is not a quantum mechanical measurement principle per se.

We show that Brillouin zones in Solid State physics are a manifestation of the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem at the quantum level. By comparison with other fields where Fourier Transform theory is used, we propose that we need to discern between measurement limitations and inherent limitations when interpreting the impact of the HUP on the nature of the quantum level.

1108.5146,quant-ph,"A tennis ball is not expected to penetrate through a brick wall since a motion under a barrier is impossible in classical mechanics. With quantum effects a motion of a particle through a barrier is allowed due to quantum tunneling. According to usual theories of tunneling, the particle density decays inside a classical barrier resulting in an extremely slow pentration process. However, there are no general laws forbidding fast motion through classical barriers. The problem addressed is investigation of unusual features o quantum tunneling through a classic static barrier which is at least two-dimensional. Here we show that penetration through such barrier can be not slow. When the barrier satisfies the certain conditions, a regime of quantum lens is possible with formation of caustics. De Broglie waves are reflected from the caustics, interfere, and result in a not small flux from under the barrier. This strongly contrasts to the usual scenario with a decaying under-barrier density. We construct a particular example of fast motion through a classical barrier. One can unexectedly conclude that, in principle, nature allows fast penetration through classical barriers which against common sense. The phenomenon may be responsible for a variety of processes in labs and nature. For example, tunneling in solids may occur with a different scenario, in biophysics and chemistry one can specify conditions for unusual reactions, and evanescent optical waves may strongly change their properties. In condensed matter and cosmic physics there are phenomena with misterious reasons of an energy emission, for instance, gamma-ray bursts.

While the communication cost of simulating nonlocal correlations of entangled states appears to be generally quite low, we show here that infinite communication is required to simulate entanglement swapping. This result is derived in the scenario of bilocality, where distant sources of particles are assumed to be independent, and takes advantage of a previous result of Massar et al. [Phys. Rev.

In this paper, we assume that two candidate states are distributed independently and uniformly in the space of the whole pure states. The minimum of the averaged error probability is given and the optimal POVM is defined as to obtain it. Using this POVM, we also compute the error probability which depends on the inner product.

Under bichromatic driving of the QD, the cavity emission exhibits spectral features consistent with optical dressing of the QD transition.

Here we show that we can do exponentially better than direct state tomography for a wide range of quantum states, in particular those that are well approximated by a matrix product state ansatz. We present two schemes for tomography in 1-D quantum systems and touch on generalizations. One scheme requires unitary operations on a constant number of subsystems, while the other requires only local measurements together with more elaborate post-processing.

As a step towards this objective, the following question is being addressed: \it Given a graph, what is the probability that a quantum walk arrives at a given vertex after some number of steps? This is a very natural question, and for random walks it can be answered by several different combinatorial arguments. For quantum walks this is a highly non-trivial task. Furthermore, this was only achieved before for one specific coin operator (Hadamard operator) for walks on the line. Even considering only walks on lines, generalizing these computations to a general SU(2) coin operator is a complex task. The main contribution is a closed-form formula for the amplitudes of the state of the walk (which includes the question above) for a general symmetric SU(2) operator for walks on the line. To this end, a coin operator with parameters that alters the phase of the state of the walk is defined. Then, closed-form solutions are computed by means of Fourier analysis and asymptotic approximation methods.

1105.4920,quant-ph,"A framework for categorizing entropic measures of nonclassical correlations in bipartite quantum states is presented. The measures are based on the difference between a quantum entropic quantity and the corresponding classical quantity obtained from measurements on the two systems. Three types of entropic quantities are used, and three different measurement strategies are applied to these quantities. Many of the resulting measures of nonclassical correlations have been proposed previously. Properties of the various measures are explored, and results of evaluating the measures for two-qubit quantum states are presented.",11,[],6
1102.3809,quant-ph,"We derive simple necessary and sufficient conditions under which a quantum channel obtained from an arbitrary perturbation from the identity can be reversed on a given code to the lowest order in fidelity. We find the usual Knill-Laflamme conditions applied to a certain operator subspace which, for a generic perturbation, is generated by the Lindblad operators. For a weak interaction with an environment, the error space to be corrected is a subspace of that spanned by the interaction operators, selected by the environment's initial state.",11,[],6
1112.2923,quant-ph,"Logical propositions with the fuzzy modality ""Probably"" are shown to obey an uncertainty principle very similar to that of Quantum Optics. In the case of such propositions, the partial truth values are in fact probabilities. The corresponding assertions in the metalanguage, have complex assertion degrees which can be interpreted as probability amplitudes. In the logical case, the uncertainty relation is about the assertion degree, which plays the role of the phase, and the total number of atomic propositions, which plays the role of the number of modes. In analogy with coherent states in quantum physics, we define ""quantum coherent propositions"" those which minimize the above logical uncertainty relation. Finally, we show that there is only one kind of compound quantum-coherent propositions: the ""cat state"" propositions.",11,[],6
1104.4738,quant-ph,"The purpose of this article is threefold. Firstly, it aims to present, in an educational and non-technical fashion, the main ideas at the basis of Aerts' creation-discovery view and hidden measurement approach: a fundamental explanatory framework whose importance, in this author's view, has been seriously underappreciated by the physics community, despite its success in clarifying many conceptual challenges of quantum physics. Secondly, it aims to introduce a new quantum-machine - that we call the delta-quantum-machine - which is able to reproduce the transmission and reflection probabilities of a one-dimensional quantum scattering process by a Dirac delta-function potential. The machine is used not only to demonstrate the pertinence of the above mentioned explanatory framework, in the general description of physical systems, but also to illustrate (in the spirit of Aerts' epsilon-model) the origin of classical and quantum structures, by revealing the existence of processes which are neither classical nor quantum, but irreducibly intermediate. We do this by explicitly introducing what we call the k-model and by proving that its processes cannot be modelized by a classical or quantum scattering system. The third purpose of this work is to exploit the powerful metaphor provided by our quantum-machine, to investigate the intimate relation between the concept of potentiality and the notion of non-spatiality, that we characterize in precise terms, introducing for this the new concept of process-actuality.",11,[],6
1103.4733,quant-ph,"We present a quantum model for electro-optic amplitude modulation, which is built upon quantum models of the main photonic components that constitute the modulator, that is, the guided-wave beamsplitter and the electro-optic phase modulator and accounts for all the different available modulator structures. General models are developed both for single and dual drive configurations and specific results are obtained for the most common configurations currently employed. Finally, the operation with two-photon input for the control of phase-modulated photons and the important topic of multicarrier modulation are also addressed.",11,[],6
1108.2194,quant-ph,"The quantum-like representation algorithm (QLRA) was introduced by A. Khrennikov \citeK1,K2,K3,K4,K5 to solve the ""inverse Born's rule problem"", i.e. to construct a representation of probabilistic data - measured in any context of science - and represent this data by a complex or more general (A Clifford algebra is introduced for this more general representation) probability amplitude which matches a generalization of Born's rule. The outcome from QLRA will introduce the formula of total probability with an additional term of trigonometric, hyperbolic or hyper-trigonometric interference and this is in fact a generalization of the familiar formula of interference of probabilities.   We study representation of statistical data (of any origin) by a probability amplitude in a complex algebra and a Clifford algebra (algebra of hyperbolic numbers). The statistical datas are collected from measurements of two trichotomous observables and the complexity of the problem increased eventually compared to the case of dichotomous observables. We see that only special statistical data (satisfying a number of nonlinear constraints) have a quantum-like representation. In this paper we will present a class of statistical data which satisfy these nonlinear constraints and have a quantum-like representation. This quantum-like representation induces trigonometric-, hyperbolic- and hyper-trigonometric interferences representation.",11,[],6
1108.3309,quant-ph,"Entanglement is the quintessential quantum mechanical phenomenon understood to lie at the heart of future quantum technologies and the subject of fundamental scientific investigations. Mixture, resulting from noise, is often an unwanted result of interaction with an environment, but is also of fundamental interest, and is proposed to play a role in some biological processes. Here we report an integrated waveguide device that can generate and completely characterize pure two-photon states with any amount of entanglement and arbitrary single-photon states with any amount of mixture. The device consists of a reconfigurable integrated quantum photonic circuit with eight voltage controlled phase shifters. We demonstrate that for thousands of randomly chosen configurations the device performs with high fidelity. We generate maximally and non-maximally entangled states, violate a Bell-type inequality with a continuum of partially entangled states, and demonstrate generation of arbitrary one-qubit mixed states.",11,[],6
1105.4714,quant-ph,"One of the most surprising predictions of modern quantum theory is that the vacuum of space is not empty. In fact, quantum theory predicts that it teems with virtual particles flitting in and out of existence. While initially a curiosity, it was quickly realized that these vacuum fluctuations had measurable consequences, for instance producing the Lamb shift of atomic spectra and modifying the magnetic moment for the electron. This type of renormalization due to vacuum fluctuations is now central to our understanding of nature. However, these effects provide indirect evidence for the existence of vacuum fluctuations. From early on, it was discussed if it might instead be possible to more directly observe the virtual particles that compose the quantum vacuum. 40 years ago, Moore suggested that a mirror undergoing relativistic motion could convert virtual photons into directly observable real photons. This effect was later named the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE). Using a superconducting circuit, we have observed the DCE for the first time. The circuit consists of a coplanar transmission line with an electrical length that can be changed at a few percent of the speed of light. The length is changed by modulating the inductance of a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) at high frequencies (~11 GHz). In addition to observing the creation of real photons, we observe two-mode squeezing of the emitted radiation, which is a signature of the quantum character of the generation process.",11,[],6
1101.2668,quant-ph,"The dependence of the dynamics of open quantum systems upon initial correlations between the system and environment is an utterly important yet poorly understood subject. For technical convenience most prior studies assume factorizable initial states where the system and its environments are uncorrelated, but these conditions are not very realistic and give rise to peculiar behaviors. One distinct feature is the rapid build up or a sudden jolt of physical quantities immediately after the system is brought in contact with its environments. The ultimate cause of this is an initial imbalance between system-environment correlations and coupling. In this note we demonstrate explicitly how to avoid these unphysical behaviors by proper adjustments of correlations and/or the coupling, for setups of both theoretical and experimental interest. We provide simple analytical results in terms of quantities that appear in linear (as opposed to affine) master equations derived for factorized initial states.",11,[],6
1112.5064,quant-ph,"Future quantum information networks will likely consist of quantum and classical agents, who have the ability to communicate in a variety of ways with trusted and untrusted parties and securely delegate computational tasks to untrusted large-scale quantum computing servers. Multipartite quantum entanglement is a fundamental resource for such a network and hence it is imperative to study the possibility of verifying a multipartite entanglement source in a way that is efficient and provides strong guarantees even in the presence of multiple dishonest parties. In this work, we show how an agent of a quantum network can perform a distributed verification of a multipartite entangled source with minimal resources, which is, nevertheless, resistant against any number of dishonest parties. Moreover, we provide a tight tradeoff between the level of security and the distance between the state produced by the source and the ideal maximally entangled state. Last, by adding the resource of a trusted common random source, we can further provide security guarantees for all honest parties in the quantum network simultaneously.",11,[],6
1101.0404,quant-ph,"An efficient scheme is proposed to carry out gate operations on an array of trapped Ybequation ions, based on a previous proposal using both electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom in a magnetic field gradient. For this purpose we consider the Paschen-Back regime (strong magnetic field) and employ a high-field approximation in this treatment. We show the possibility to suppress the unwanted coupling between the electron spins by appropriately swapping states between electronic and nuclear spins. The feasibility of generating the required high magnetic field is discussed.",11,[],6
1103.5065,quant-ph,"We investigate the error due to D.C. Stark effect for quantum information processing for trapped ion quantum computers using the scalable architecture proposed in J. Res. Natl. Inst. Stan. 103, 259 (1998) and Nature 417, 709 (2002). As the operation speed increases, dephasing and decoherence due to the D.C. Stark effect becomes prominent as a large electric field is applied for transporting ions rapidly. We estimate the relative significance of the decoherence and dephasing effects and find that the latter is dominant. We find that the minimum possible of dephasing is quadratic in the time of flight, and an inverse cubic in the operational time scale. From these relations, we obtain the operational speed-range at which the shifts caused by D.C. Stark effect, no matter follow which trajectory the ion is transported, are no longer negligible. Without phase correction, the maximum speed a qubit can be transferred across a 100 micron-long trap, without excessive error, in about 10 ns for Calcium ion and 50 ps for Beryllium ion. In practice, the accumulated error is difficult to be tracked and calculated, our work gives an estimation to the range of speed limit imposed by D.C. Stark effect.",11,[],6

1104.2349,quant-ph,"It was recently shown that, for solving NP-complete problems, adiabatic paths always exist without finite-order perturbative crossings between local and global minima, which could lead to anticrossings with exponentially small energy gaps if present. However, it was not shown whether such a path could be found easily. Here, we give a simple construction that deterministically eliminates all such anticrossings in polynomial time, space, and energy, for any Ising models with polynomial final gap. Thus, in order for adiabatic quantum optimization to require exponential time to solve any NP-complete problem, some quality other than this type of anticrossing must be unavoidable and necessitate exponentially long runtimes.",11,[],6

1105.2111,quant-ph,"In this paper we prove, extend and review possible mappings between the two-dimensional Cluster state, Wen's model, the two-dimensional Ising chain and Kitaev's toric code model. We introduce a two-dimensional duality transformation to map the two-dimensional lattice cluster state into the topologically-ordered Wen model. Then, we subsequently investigates how this mapping could be achieved physically, which allows us to discuss the rate at which a topologically ordered system can be achieved. Next, using a lattice fermionization method, Wen's model is mapped into a series of one-dimensional Ising interactions. Considering the boundary terms with this mapping then reveals how the Ising chains interact with one another. The relationships discussed in this paper allow us to consider these models from two different perspectives: From the perspective of condensed matter physics these mappings allow us to learn more about the relation between the ground state properties of the four different models, such as their entanglement or topological structure. On the other hand, we take the duality of these models as a starting point to address questions related to the universality of their ground states for quantum computation.",11,[],6
1107.5716,quant-ph,The effect of Gaussian fluctuations of nanopores filled with a gas of spin-carrying molecules (equation) on the multiple quantum (MQ) NMR dynamics is investigated at different variances and correlation times of the fluctuations.

To determine the state of a simulated system, existing treatments involve the computation of cumulative phase factors which involve quadratic dependencies. We present a simple formalism in which Pauli operators are represented using displacement operators in discrete phase space, expressing the evolution of the state via linear transformations modulo D <= 2d.

Furthermore, we only assume that the dimensionality of the system used in the protocol has a tight bound, and the whole protocol can be regarded as a semi-device independent black-box scenario. Comparing with the device independent random number expansion protocol based on entanglement, our protocol is much easier to implement and test.",11,[],6
1104.1500,quant-ph,"A path-integral approach to the quantization of the electromagnetic field in a linearly amplifying magnetodielectric medium is presented. Two continua of inverted harmonic oscillators are used to describe the polarizability and magnetizability of the amplifying medium. The causal susceptibilities of the amplifying medium, with negative imaginary parts in finite frequency intervals, are identified and their relation to microscopic coupling functions are determined. By carefully relating the two-point functions of the field theory to the optical Green functions, we calculate the Casimir energy and Casimir forces for a multilayer magnetodielectric medium with both gain and loss. We point out the essential differences with a purely passive layered medium. For a single layer, we find different bounds on the Casimir force for fully amplifying and for lossy media. The force is attractive in both cases, also if the medium exhibits negative refraction. From our Lagrangian we also derive by canonical quantization the postulates of the phenomenological theory of amplifying magnetodielectrics.",11,[],6

Our scheme is based on visibility measurements of quantum correlations and achieves the ultimate precision allowed by quantum mechanics in the limit of Poissonian distribution of coincidence counts. Although optimal estimation of entanglement does not require the full tomography of the states we have also performed state reconstruction using two different sets of tomographic projectors and explicitly shown that they provide a less precise determination of entanglement. The use of optimal estimators also allows us to compare and statistically assess the different noise models used to describe decoherence effects occuring in the generation of entanglement.",11,[],6
1107.0302,quant-ph,"Entanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics. It gives rise to peculiar correlations which cannot be reproduced by a large class of alternative theories, the so-called hidden-variable models, that use parameters in addition to the wave-function. This incompatibility was quantified through the celebrated Bell inequalities, and more recently through new inequalities due to Leggett. Experiments confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics. However, this does not imply that quantum mechanics is the ultimate theory, unsusceptible of improvement, nor that quantum mechanics is essentially non-local. The theories ruled out by Bell and Leggett inequalities are required to satisfy some hypotheses, none of which is implied by locality alone. By dropping one or more hypotheses, it is possible not only to violate said inequalities, but to reproduce the quantum mechanical predictions altogether. So far, the models proposed were only mathematical constructs. In this paper we provide a classical realization of two of these models, using local classical resources, without recurring to any type of communication among the involved parties. The resources consist in two baseballs, two bats, and a number of synchronized watches. Our results demonstrate the possibility of reproducing the quantum mechanical correlations, and even creating stronger correlations which provide the maximum violation of the Bell inequality, beyond the Cirel'son bound for quantum mechanics.",11,[],6

1108.5743,quant-ph,"The reciprocity principle is that, when an emitted wave gets scattered on an object, the scattering transition amplitude does not change if we interchange the source and the detector - in other words, if incoming waves are interchanged with appropriate outgoing ones. Reciprocity is sometimes confused with time reversal invariance, or with invariance under the rotation that interchanges the location of the source and the location of the detector. Actually, reciprocity covers the former as a special case, and is fundamentally different from - but can be usefully combined with - the latter. Reciprocity can be proved as a theorem in many situations and is found violated in other cases.
