1507.07900,astro-ph,"Lyman Break Analogs (LBA) are local proxies of high-redshift Lyman Break Galaxies (LBG). Studies of nearby starbursts have shown that Lyman continuum and line emission are absorbed by dust and that the Lyman-alpha is resonantly scattered by neutral hydrogen. A source of feedback is required to prevent scattering and allow the Lyman-alpha emission to escape. There are two X-ray point sources embedded in the Lyman Break Analog (LBA) galaxy Haro 11. Haro 11 X-1 is an extremely luminous (Lequation ergs sequation), spatially compact source with a hard X-ray spectrum. Haro 11 X-1 is similar to the extreme Black Hole Binary (BHB) M82 X-1. The hard X-ray spectrum indicates Haro 11 X-1 may be a Black Hole Binary (BHB) in a low accretion state. The very high X-ray luminosity suggests an intermediate mass black hole that could be the seed for formation of a supermassive black hole. Source Haro 11 X-2 has an X-ray luminosity Lequation ergs sequation and a soft X-ray spectrum. This strongly suggests that Haro 11 X-2 is an X-ray binary in the ultra luminous state. Haro 11 X-2 is coincident with the star forming knot that is the source of the Lyman-alpha emission, raising the possibility that strong winds from X-ray binaries play an important part in injecting mechanical power into the Interstellar Medium (ISM), thus blowing away neutral material from the starburst region and allowing the Lyman-alpha to escape. We suggest that feedback from X-ray binaries may play a significant role in allowing Lyman-alpha emission to escape from galaxies in the early universe.",15,[],1
1507.05696,astro-ph,"The Ultra-Fast Flash Observatory pathfinder (UFFO-p) is a new space mission dedicated to detect Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and rapidly follow their afterglows in order to provide early optical/ultraviolet measurements. A GRB location is determined in a few seconds by the UFFO Burst Alert & Trigger telescope (UBAT) employing the coded mask imaging technique and the detector combination of Yttrium Oxyorthosilicate (YSO) scintillating crystals and multi-anode photomultiplier tubes. The results of the laboratory tests of UBAT's functionality and performance are described in this article. The detector setting, the pixel-to-pixel response to X-rays of different energies, the imaging capability for <50 keV X-rays, the localization accuracy measurements, and the combined test with the Block for X-ray and Gamma-Radiation Detection (BDRG) scintillator detector to check the efficiency of UBAT are all described. The UBAT instrument has been assembled and integrated with other equipment on UFFO-p and should be launched on board the Lomonosov satellite in late-2015.",15,[],1
1507.08621,astro-ph,"We observed NGC 1624-2, the O-type star with the largest known magnetic field Bp~20 kG), in X-rays with the ACIS-S camera onboard the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Our two observations were obtained at the minimum and maximum of the periodic Halpha emission cycle, corresponding to the rotational phases where the magnetic field is the closest to equator-on and pole-on, respectively. With these observations, we aim to characterise the star's magnetosphere via the X-ray emission produced by magnetically confined wind shocks. Our main findings are:   (i) The observed spectrum of NGC 1624-2 is hard, similar to the magnetic O-type star Theta 1 Ori C, with only a few photons detected below 0.8 keV. The emergent X-ray flux is 30% lower at the Halpha minimum phase.   (ii) Our modelling indicated that this seemingly hard spectrum is in fact a consequence of relatively soft intrinsic emission, similar to other magnetic Of?p stars, combined with a large amount of local absorption (~1-3 x 1022 cm-2). This combination is necessary to reproduce both the prominent Mg and Si spectral features, and the lack of flux at low energies. NGC 1624-2 is intrinsically luminous in X-rays (log LX emission ~ 33.4) but 70-95% of the X-ray emission produced by magnetically confined wind shocks is absorbed before it escapes the magnetosphere (log LX ISM corrected ~ 32.5).   (iii) The high X-ray luminosity, its variation with stellar rotation, and its large attenuation are all consistent with a large dynamical magnetosphere with magnetically confined wind shocks.",15,[],1
1506.04796,astro-ph,"Population III stars can regulate star formation in the primordial Universe in several ways. They can ionize nearby halos, and even if their ionizing photons are trapped by their own halos, their Lyman-Werner (LW) photons can still escape and destroy Hequation in other halos, preventing them from cooling and forming stars. LW escape fractions are thus a key parameter in cosmological simulations of early reionization and star formation but have not yet been parametrized for realistic halos by halo or stellar mass. To do so, we perform radiation hydrodynamical simulations of LW UV escape from 9--120 Mequation Pop III stars in equation to equation Mequation halos with ZEUS-MP. We find that photons in the LW lines (i.e. those responsible for destroying Hequation in nearby systems) have escape fractions ranging from 0% to 85%. No LW photons escape the most massive halo in our sample, even from the most massive star. Escape fractions for photons elsewhere in the 11.18--13.6~eV energy range, which can be redshifted into the LW lines at cosmological distances, are generally much higher, being above 60% for all but the least massive stars in the most massive halos. We find that shielding of Hequation by neutral hydrogen, which has been neglected in most studies to date, produces escape fractions that are up to a factor of three smaller than those predicted by Hequation self-shielding alone.",15,[],1
1504.05465,astro-ph,"Galaxy shapes are not randomly oriented, rather they are statistically aligned in a way that can depend on formation environment, history and galaxy type. Studying the alignment of galaxies can therefore deliver important information about the physics of galaxy formation and evolution as well as the growth of structure in the Universe. In this review paper we summarise key measurements of galaxy alignments, divided by galaxy type, scale and environment. We also cover the statistics and formalism necessary to understand the observations in the literature. With the emergence of weak gravitational lensing as a precision probe of cosmology, galaxy alignments have taken on an added importance because they can mimic cosmic shear, the effect of gravitational lensing by large-scale structure on observed galaxy shapes. This makes galaxy alignments, commonly referred to as intrinsic alignments, an important systematic effect in weak lensing studies. We quantify the impact of intrinsic alignments on cosmic shear surveys and finish by reviewing practical mitigation techniques which attempt to remove contamination by intrinsic alignments.",15,[],1
1507.01525,astro-ph,"Low-mass X-ray binaries hosting neutron stars (NS) exhibit thermonuclear (type-I) X-ray bursts, which are powered by unstable nuclear burning of helium and/or hydrogen into heavier elements deep in the NS ""ocean"". In some cases the burning ashes may rise from the burning depths up to the NS photosphere by convection, leading to the appearance of the metal absorption edges in the spectra, which then force the emergent X-ray burst spectra to shift toward lower energies. These effects may have a substantial impact on the color correction factor equation and the dilution factor equation, the parameters of the diluted blackbody model equation that is commonly used to describe the emergent spectra from NSs. The aim of this paper is to quantify how much the metal enrichment can change these factors. We have developed a new NS atmosphere modeling code, which has a few important improvements compared to our previous code required by inclusion of the metals. The opacities and the internal partition functions (used in the ionization fraction calculations) are now taken into account for all atomic species. In addition, the code is now parallelized to counter the increased computational load. We compute a detailed grid of atmosphere models with different exotic chemical compositions that mimic the presence of the burning ashes. From the emerging model spectra we compute the color correction factors equation and the dilution factors equation that can then be compared to the observations. We find that the metals may change equation by up to about 40%, which is enough to explain the scatter seen in the blackbody radius measurements. The presented models open up the possibility for determining NS mass and radii more accurately, and may also act as a tool to probe the nuclear burning mechanisms of X-ray bursts.",15,[],1
1501.06708,astro-ph,"Magnetic waves are a relevant component in the dynamics of the solar atmosphere. Their significance has increased because of their potential as a remote diagnostic tool and their presumed contribution to plasma heating processes. We discuss our current understanding on coronal heating by magnetic waves, based on recent observational evidence and theoretical advances. The discussion starts with a selection of observational discoveries that have brought magnetic waves to the forefront of the coronal heating discussion. Then, our theoretical understanding on the nature and properties of the observed waves and the physical processes that have been proposed to explain observations are described. Particular attention is given to the sequence of processes that link observed wave characteristics with concealed energy transport, dissipation, and heat conversion. We conclude with a commentary on how the combination of theory and observations should help us understanding and quantifying magnetic wave heating of the solar atmosphere.",15,[],1
1507.07272,astro-ph,"We present results from the first twelve months of operation of Radio Galaxy Zoo, which upon completion will enable visual inspection of over 170,000 radio sources to determine the host galaxy of the radio emission and the radio morphology. Radio Galaxy Zoo uses equationGHz radio images from both the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) and the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS) in combination with mid-infrared images at equationm from the \it Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and at equationm from the \it Spitzer Space Telescope. We present the early analysis of the WISE mid-infrared colours of the host galaxies. For images in which there is equation consensus among the Radio Galaxy Zoo cross-identifications, the project participants are as effective as the science experts at identifying the host galaxies. The majority of the identified host galaxies reside in the mid-infrared colour space dominated by elliptical galaxies, quasi-stellar objects (QSOs), and luminous infrared radio galaxies (LIRGs). We also find a distinct population of Radio Galaxy Zoo host galaxies residing in a redder mid-infrared colour space consisting of star-forming galaxies and/or dust-enhanced non star-forming galaxies consistent with a scenario of merger-driven active galactic nuclei (AGN) formation. The completion of the full Radio Galaxy Zoo project will measure the relative populations of these hosts as a function of radio morphology and power while providing an avenue for the identification of rare and extreme radio structures. Currently, we are investigating candidates for radio galaxies with extreme morphologies, such as giant radio galaxies, late-type host galaxies with extended radio emission, and hybrid morphology radio sources.",15,[],1
1504.00074,astro-ph,"We searched for superflares on solar-type stars using Kepler data with 1 min sampling in order to detect superflares with short duration. We found 187 superflares on 23 solar-type stars whose bolometric energy ranges from the order of equation erg to equation erg. Some superflares show multiple peaks with the peak separation of the order of equation-equation seconds which is comparable to the periods of quasi-periodic pulsations in solar and stellar flares. Using these new data combined with the results from the data with 30 min sampling, we found the occurrence frequency (equation) of superflares as a function of flare energy (equation) shows the power-law distribution (equation) with equation for equation erg which is consistent with the previous results. The average occurrence rate of superflares with the energy of equation erg which is equivalent to X100 solar flares is about once in 500-600 years. The upper limit of energy released by superflares is basically comparable to a fraction of the magnetic energy stored near starspots which is estimated from the photometry. We also found that the duration of superflares (equation) increases with the flare energy (equation) as equation. This can be explained if we assume the time-scale of flares is determined by the Alfvequationn time.",15,[],1
1503.03368,astro-ph,"We examine GRBs with both Fermi-LAT and X-ray afterglow data. Assuming that the 100MeV (LAT) emission is radiation from cooled electrons accelerated by external shocks, we show that the kinetic energy of the blast wave estimated from the 100MeV flux is 50 times larger than the one estimated from the X-ray flux. This can be explained if either: i) electrons radiating at X-rays are significantly cooled by SSC (suppressing the synchrotron flux above the cooling frequency) or ii) if the X-ray emitting electrons, unlike those emitting at 100MeV energies, are in the slow cooling regime. In both cases the X-ray flux is no longer an immediate proxy of the blast wave kinetic energy. We model the LAT, X-ray and optical data and show that in general these possibilities are consistent with the data, and explain the apparent disagreement between X-ray and LAT observations. All possible solutions require weak magnetic fields: equation (where equation is the fraction of shocked plasma energy in magnetic fields). Using the LAT emission as a proxy for the blast wave kinetic energy we find that the derived prompt efficiencies are of order 15%. This is considerably lower compared with previous estimates (87% and higher for the same bursts). This provides at least a partial solution to the ""prompt high efficiency paradox"".",15,[],1
1509.04008,astro-ph,"We use an existing laboratory facility for space hardware calibration in vacuum to study the impact of energetic ions on water ice. The experiment is intended to simulate the conditions on the surface of Jupiter's icy moons. We present first results of ion sputtering in a sample of porous ice, including the first experimental results for sulphur ion sputtering of ice. The results confirm theoretical predictions and extrapolations from previous sputtering experiments obtained at different impact angles for non-porous water ice.",15,[],1
1509.06818,astro-ph,"Based on gas-phase laboratory spectra at 6 K, Campbell et al. (2015) confirmed that the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) at 9632.7 and 9577.5A are due to absorption by the fullerene ion C60. They also reported the detection of two other, weaker bands at 9428.5 and 9365.9A. These lie in spectral regions heavily contaminated by telluric water vapour lines. We acquired CFHT ESPaDOnS spectra of HD183143 close to the zenith and chopped with a nearby standard to correct for the telluric line absorption which enabled us to detect a DIB at 9365.9A of relative width and strength comparable to the laboratory absorption. There is a DIB of similar strength and FWHM at 9362.5A. A stellar emission feature at 9429A prevented detection of the 9428.5A band. However, a CFHT archival spectrum of HD169454, where emission is absent at 9429A, clearly shows the 9428.5A DIB with the expected strength and width. These results further confirm C60 as a DIB carrier.",15,[],1
1508.07394,astro-ph,"We infer the emission positions of twin kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) in neutron star low mass X-ray binaries (NS-LMXBs) based on the Alfven wave oscillation model (AWOM). For most sources, the emission radii of kHz QPOs cluster around a region of 16-19 km with the assumed NS radii of 15 km. Cir X-1 has the larger emission radii of 23-38 km than those of the other sources, which may be ascribed to its large magnetosphere-disk radius or strong NS surface magnetic field. SAX J1808.4-3658 is also a particular source with the relative large emission radii of kHz QPOs of 20 - 23 km, which may be due to its large inferred NS radius of 18 - 19 km. The emission radii of kHz QPOs for all the sources are larger than the NS radii, and the possible explanations of which are presented. The similarity of the emission radii of kHz QPOs (16-19 km) for both the low/high luminosity Atoll/Z sources is found, which indicates that both sources share the similar magnetosphere- disk radii.",15,[],1
1508.04285,astro-ph,"We compare two different methods of constraining the characteristic velocity and spatial scales of gas motions in the X-ray bright, nearby Centaurus cluster, using new deep (760ks) Chandra observations. The power spectrum of excess surface brightness fluctuations in the 0.5-6.0 keV band in a sector to the west is measured and compared to theoretical expectations for Kolmogorov index fluctuations. The observed power spectrum is flatter than these expectations, and the surface brightness fluctuations are around the 8 percent level on length scales of 2 kpc. We convert the 2D power spectrum of fluctuations into a 3D power spectrum using the method of Churazov et al., and then convert this into constraints on the one-component velocity of the gas motions as a function of their length scale. We find one-component velocities in the range 100-150 km/s on spatial scales of 4-10 kpc. An independent constraint on the characteristic velocity and length scales of the gas motions is then found by considering the diffusion coefficient needed to explain the distribution of metals in the Centaurus cluster, combined with the need to balance the rate of gas cooling with the rate of heat dissipated by the gas motions. We find that these two methods of constraining the velocity and length scales of the gas motions are in good agreement.",15,[],1
1508.05942,astro-ph,"The presence of two red clumps (RCs) in high latitude fields of the Milky Way bulge is interpreted as evidence for an X-shaped structure originated from the bar instability. Here we show, however, that this double RC phenomenon is more likely to be another manifestation of multiple populations observed in globular clusters (GCs) in the metal-rich regime. As in the bulge GC Terzan 5, the helium enhanced second generation stars (G2) in the classical bulge component of the Milky Way are placed on the bright RC, which is about 0.5 mag brighter than the normal RC originated from the first generation stars (G1), producing the observed double RC. In a composite bulge, where a classical bulge can coexist with a boxy pseudo bulge, our models can also reproduce key observations, such as the dependence of the double RC feature on metallicity and Galactic latitude and longitude. If confirmed by Gaia trigonometric parallax distances, this would indicate that the Milky Way bar is not sufficiently buckled to form the X-shaped structure in the bulge, and suggest that the early-type galaxies would be similarly prevailed by super-helium-rich subpopulation.",15,[],1
1501.02270,astro-ph,"The CHemical Abundances of Spirals (CHAOS) project leverages the combined power of the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) with the broad spectral range and sensitivity of the Multi Object Double Spectrograph (MODS) to measure ""direct"" abundances in large samples of HII regions in spiral galaxies. We present LBT MODS observations of 62 HII regions in the nearby NGC628. We measure one or more auroral lines ([OIII] 4363, [NII] 5755, [SIII] 6312, or [OII] 7320,7330) in a large number of HII regions (40). Comparing derived temperatures from multiple auroral line measurements, we find: a strong correlation between temperatures based on [SIII] and [NII]; and large discrepancies for some temperatures based on [OII] and [OIII]. These trends are consistent with other observations in the literature, yet, given the widespread use and acceptance of [OIII] as a temperature determinant, the magnitude of the T[OIII] discrepancies still came as a surprise. Based on these results, we conduct a uniform abundance analysis using the temperatures derived from [SIII] and [NII], and report the gas-phase abundance gradients for NGC628. Relative abundances of S/O, Ne/O, and Ar/O are constant across the galaxy, consistent with no systematic change in the upper IMF over the sampled range in metallicity. These alpha-element ratios, along with N/O, all show small dispersions consistent with no intrinsic dispersion (0.05) over 70% of the azimuthally averaged radius. We interpret these results as an indication that, at a given radius, the interstellar medium in NGC628 is chemically well-mixed. Unlike the nearly temperature-independent gradients, O/H abundances have a larger intrinsic dispersion of ~0.13 dex. We posit that this dispersion represents an upper limit to the true dispersion in O/H at a given radius and that some of that dispersion is due to systematic uncertainties arising from temperature measurements.",15,[],1
1506.09108,astro-ph,"Transverse magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves are ubiquitous in the solar atmosphere and may be responsible for generating the Sun's million-degree outer atmosphere. However, direct evidence of the dissipation process and heating from these waves remains elusive. Through advanced numerical simulations combined with appropriate forward modeling of a prominence flux tube, we provide the observational signatures of transverse MHD waves in prominence plasmas. We show that these signatures are characterized by thread-like substructure, strong transverse dynamical coherence, an out-of-phase difference between plane-of-the-sky motions and LOS velocities, and enhanced line broadening and heating around most of the flux tube. A complex combination between resonant absorption and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI) takes place in which the KHI extracts the energy from the resonant layer and dissipates it through vortices and current sheets, which rapidly degenerate into turbulence. An inward enlargement of the boundary is produced in which the turbulent flows conserve the characteristic dynamics from the resonance, therefore guaranteeing detectability of the resonance imprints. We show that the features described in the accompanying paper (Okamoto et al. 2015) through coordinated Hinode and IRIS observations match well the numerical results.",15,[],1

1508.05941,astro-ph,"We present new ultraviolet, optical, and X-ray data on the Phoenix galaxy cluster (SPT-CLJ2344-4243). Deep optical imaging reveals previously-undetected filaments of star formation, extending to radii of ~50-100 kpc in multiple directions. Combined UV-optical spectroscopy of the central galaxy reveals a massive (2x109 Msun)), young (~4.5 Myr) population of stars, consistent with a time-averaged star formation rate of 610 /- 50 Msun/yr. We report a strong detection of OVI(1032,1038) which appears to originate primarily in shock-heated gas, but may contain a substantial contribution (>1000 Msun/yr) from the cooling intracluster medium. We confirm the presence of deep X-ray cavities in the inner ~10 kpc, which are amongst the most extreme examples of radio-mode feedback detected to date, implying jet powers of 2-7 x1045 erg/s. We provide evidence that the AGN inflating these cavities may have only recently transitioned from ""quasar-mode"" to ""radio-mode"", and may currently be insufficient to completely offset cooling. A model-subtracted residual X-ray image reveals evidence for prior episodes of strong radio-mode feedback at radii of ~100 kpc, with extended ""ghost"" cavities indicating a prior epoch of feedback roughly 100 Myr ago. This residual image also exhibits significant asymmetry in the inner ~200 kpc (0.15R500), reminiscent of infalling cool clouds, either due to minor mergers or fragmentation of the cooling ICM. Taken together, these data reveal a rapidly evolving cool core which is rich with structure (both spatially and in temperature), is subject to a variety of highly energetic processes, and yet is cooling rapidly and forming stars along thin, narrow filaments.",15,[],1
1509.04997,astro-ph,"Experimental efforts to measure neutrinos by radio-frequency (RF) signals resulting from neutrino interactions in-ice have intensified over the last decade. Recent calculations indicate that one may dramatically improve the sensitivity of ultra-high energy (""UHE""; >EeV) neutrino experiments via detection of radio waves trapped along the air-ice surface. Detectors designed to observe the ""Askaryan effect"" currently search for RF electromagnetic pulses propagating through bulk ice, and could therefore gain sensitivity if signals are confined to the ice-air boundary. To test the feasibilty of this scenario, measurements of the complex radio-frequency properties of several air-dielectric interfaces were performed for a variety of materials. Two-dimensional surfaces of granulated fused silica (sand), both in the lab as well as occurring naturally, water doped with varying concentrations of salt, natural rock salt formations, granulated salt and ice itself were studied, both in North America and also Antarctica.

1512.03857,astro-ph,"The XXL survey is the largest survey carried out by XMM-Newton. Covering an area of 50degequation, the survey contains equation galaxy clusters out to a redshift equation2 and to an X-ray flux limit of equation. This paper is part of the first release of XXL results focussed on the bright cluster sample. We investigate the scaling relation between weak-lensing mass and X-ray temperature for the brightest clusters in XXL. The scaling relation is used to estimate the mass of all 100 clusters in XXL-100-GC. Based on a subsample of 38 objects that lie within the intersection of the northern XXL field and the publicly available CFHTLenS catalog, we derive the equation of each system with careful considerations of the systematics. The clusters lie at equation and span a range of equation. We combine our sample with 58 clusters from the literature, increasing the range out to 10keV. To date, this is the largest sample of clusters with equation measurements that has been used to study the mass-temperature relation. The fit (equation) to the XXL clusters returns a slope equation and intrinsic scatter equation; the scatter is dominated by disturbed clusters. The fit to the combined sample of 96 clusters is in tension with self-similarity, equation and equation. Overall our results demonstrate the feasibility of ground-based weak-lensing scaling relation studies down to cool systems of equation temperature and highlight that the current data and samples are a limit to our statistical precision. As such we are unable to determine whether the validity of hydrostatic equilibrium is a function of halo mass. An enlarged sample of cool systems, deeper weak-lensing data, and robust modelling of the selection function will help to explore these issues further.",15,[],1
1503.02593,astro-ph,"About one third of early-type barred galaxies host small-scale secondary bars. The formation and evolution of such double-barred galaxies remain far from being well understood. In order to understand the formation of such systems, we explore a large parameter space of isolated pure-disk simulations. We show that a dynamically cool inner disk embedded in a hotter outer disk can naturally generate a steady secondary bar while the outer disk forms a large-scale primary bar. The independent bar instabilities of inner and outer disks result in long-lived double-barred structures whose dynamical properties are comparable with observations. This formation scenario indicates that the secondary bar might form from the general bar instability, the same as the primary bar. Under some circumstances, the interaction of the bars and the disk leads to the two bars aligning or single, nuclear, bars only. Simulations that are cool enough of the center to experience clump instabilities may also generate steady double-barred galaxies. In this case, the secondary bars are ""fast"", i.e., the bar length is close to the co-rotation radius. This is the first time that double-barred galaxies containing a fast secondary bar are reported. Previous orbit-based studies had suggested that fast secondary bars are not dynamically possible.",15,[],1

We investigate magnetic activity and search for a decrease in X-ray emission in the pre-MS progenitors of these MS stars. We present XMM-Newton X-ray observations and preliminary results for ~10 nearby (30-70 pc), very low mass pre-MS stars in the relatively unexplored age range of 10-30 Myr. We compare the fractional X-ray luminosities of these 10-30 Myr old stars to younger (1-3 Myr) pre-MS brown dwarfs and find no dependence on spectral type or age suggesting that X-ray activity declines at an age later than ~30 Myr in these very low-mass stars.",15,[],1

1511.04076,astro-ph,"GJ758 B is a brown dwarf companion to a nearby (15.76 pc) solar-type, metal-rich (M/H = 0.2 dex) main-sequence star (G9V) that was discovered with Subaru/HiCIAO in 2009. From previous studies, it has drawn attention as being the coldest (~600K) companion ever directly imaged around a neighboring star. We present new high-contrast data obtained during the commissioning of the SPHERE instrument at the VLT. The data was obtained in Y-, J-, H-, and Ks-bands with the dual-band imaging (DBI) mode of IRDIS, providing a broad coverage of the full near-infrared (near-IR) range at higher contrast and better spectral sampling than previously reported. In this new set of high-quality data, we report the re-detection of the companion, as well as the first detection of a new candidate closer-in to the star. We use the new 8 photometric points for an extended comparison of GJ758 B with empirical objects and 4 families of atmospheric models. From comparison to empirical object, we estimate a T8 spectral type, but none of the comparison object can accurately represent the observed near-IR fluxes of GJ758 B. From comparison to atmospheric models, we attribute a Teff = 600K equation 100K, but we find that no atmospheric model can adequately fit all the fluxes of GJ758 B. The photometry of the new candidate companion is broadly consistent with L-type objects, but a second epoch with improved photometry is necessary to clarify its status. The new astrometry of GJ758 B shows a significant proper motion since the last epoch. We use this result to improve the determination of the orbital characteristics using two fitting approaches, Least-Square Monte Carlo and Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Finally, we analyze the sensitivity of our data to additional closer-in companions and reject the possibility of other massive brown dwarf companions down to 4-5 AU. [abridged]",15,[],1

1504.05209,astro-ph,"We study the interaction of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and a multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM), in simulations including explicit stellar feedback, multi-phase cooling, accretion-disk winds, and Compton heating. We examine radii ~0.1-100 pc around a black hole (BH), where the accretion rate onto the BH is determined and where AGN-powered winds and radiation couple to the ISM. We conclude: (1) The BH accretion rate is determined by exchange of angular momentum between gas and stars in gravitational instabilities. This produces accretion rates ~0.03-1 Msun/yr, sufficient to power luminous AGN. (2) The gas disk in the galactic nucleus undergoes an initial burst of star formation followed by several Myrs where stellar feedback suppresses the star formation rate (SFR). (3) AGN winds injected at small radii with momentum fluxes ~L/c couple efficiently to the ISM and have dramatic effects on ISM properties within ~100 pc. AGN winds suppress the nuclear SFR by factors ~10-30 and BH accretion rate by factors ~3-30. They increase the outflow rate from the nucleus by factors ~10, consistent with observational evidence for galaxy-scale AGN-driven outflows. (4) With AGN feedback, the predicted column density distribution to the BH is consistent with observations. Absent AGN feedback, the BH is isotropically obscured and there are not enough optically-thin sightlines to explain Type-I AGN. A 'torus-like' geometry arises self-consistently as AGN feedback evacuates gas in polar regions.",15,[],1
1510.01893,astro-ph,"RX~J1713.7equation3946 is a prototype in the equation-ray-bright supernova remnants (SNRs) and is in continuing debates on its hadronic versus leptonic origin of the equation-ray emission. We explore the role played by the diffusive relativistic protons that escape from the SNR shock wave in the equation-ray emission, apart from the high-energy particles' emission from the inside of the SNR. In the scenario that the SNR shock propagates in a clumpy molecular cavity, we consider that theequation-ray emission from the inside of the SNR may arise either from the inverse Compton scattering or from the interaction between the trapped energetic protons and the shocked clumps. The dominant origin between them depends on the electron-to-proton number ratio. The diffusive protons that escaped from the shock wave during the expansion history can provide an outer hadronic equation-ray component by bombarding the surrounding dense matter. The broadband spectrum can be well explained by this two-zone model, in which the equation-ray emission from the inside governs the TeV band, while the outer emission component substantially contributes to the GeV equation-rays. The two-zone model can also explain the TeV equation-ray radial brightness profile that significantly stretches beyond the nonthermal X-ray-emitting region. In the calculation, we present a simplified algorithm for Li & Chen's (2010) ""accumulative diffusion"" model for escaping protons and apply the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to constrain the physical parameters.",15,[],1
1502.04941,astro-ph,"In photon-dominated regions (PDRs), UV photons from nearby stars lead to the evaporation of very small grains (VSGs) and the production of gas-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Our goal is to achieve better insight into the composition and evolution of evaporating very small grains (eVSGs) and PAHs through analyzing the infrared (IR) aliphatic and aromatic emission bands. We combined spectro-imagery in the near- and mid-IR to study the spatial evolution of the emission bands in the prototypical PDR NGC 7023. We used near-IR spectra obtained with AKARI to trace the evolution of the 3.3equationm and 3.4equationm bands, which are associated with aromatic and aliphatic C-H bonds on PAHs. The spectral fitting involves an additional broad feature centred at 3.45equationm. Mid-IR observations obtained with Spitzer are used to discriminate the signatures of eVSGs, neutral and cationic PAHs. We correlated the spatial evolution of all these bands with the intensity of the UV field to explore the processing of their carriers. The intensity of the 3.45equationm plateau shows an excellent correlation with that of the 3.3equationm aromatic band (correlation coefficient R = 0.95), indicating that the plateau is dominated by the emission from aromatic bonds. The ratio of the 3.4equationm and 3.3equationm band intensity (equation) decreases by a factor of 4 at the PDR interface from the more UV-shielded to the more exposed layers. The transition region between the aliphatic and aromatic material is found to correspond spatially with the transition zone between neutral PAHs and eVSGs. We conclude that the photo-processing of eVSGs leads to the production of PAHs with attached aliphatic sidegroups that are revealed by the 3.4equationm emission band. Our analysis provides evidence for the presence of very small grains of mixed aromatic and aliphatic composition in PDRs.",15,[],1
1511.05721,astro-ph,"Deuteration is a powerful tracer of the history of the cold prestellar phase in star forming regions. Apart from methanol, little is known about deuterium fractionation of complex organic molecules in the interstellar medium, especially in high mass star forming regions. We use a spectral line survey performed with ALMA to search for deuterated complex organic molecules toward the hot molecular core Sgr B2(N2). Population diagrams and integrated intensity maps are constructed to fit rotational temperatures and emission sizes for each molecule. Column densities are derived by modelling the full spectrum under the LTE assumption. The results are compared to predictions of two astrochemical models that treat the deuteration process. We report the detection of CH2DCN toward Sgr B2(N2) with a deuteration level of 0.4%, and tentative detections of CH2DOH, CH2DCH2CN, the chiral molecule CH3CHDCN, and DC3N with levels in the range 0.05%-0.12%. A stringent deuteration upper limit is obtained for CH3OD (<0.07%). Upper limits in the range 0.5-1.8% are derived for the three deuterated isotopologues of vinyl cyanide, the four deuterated species of ethanol, and CH2DOCHO. Ethyl cyanide is less deuterated than methyl cyanide by at least a factor five. Except for methyl cyanide, the measured deuteration levels lie at least a factor four below the predictions of current astrochemical models. The deuteration levels in Sgr B2(N2) are also lower than in Orion KL by a factor of a few up to a factor ten. The discrepancy between the deuteration levels of Sgr B2(N2) and the predictions of chemical models, and the difference between Sgr B2(N2) and Orion KL may both be due to the higher kinetic temperatures that characterize the Galactic Center region compared to nearby clouds. Alternatively, they may result from a lower overall abundance of deuterium itself in the Galactic Center region by up to a factor ten.",15,[],1

1509.04477,astro-ph,"The spectral shape of the prompt emissions of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is typically expressed by the Band function: smooth joining of two power-law functions for high-energy and low-energy regions. To reveal the origin of the Band function, we revisit the stochastic acceleration model, in which electrons are accelerated via scattering with turbulent waves in the GRB outflow. The balance between the acceleration and synchrotron cooling yields a narrow energy-distribution similar to the Maxwellian distribution. The synchrotron spectrum becomes consistent with the observed hard photon index for the low-energy region. On the other hand, the narrow electron energy distribution contradicts the power-law spectrum for the high-energy region. We consider an evolution of the electron energy distribution to solve this problem. The turbulence and magnetic field induced by a certain hydrodynamical instability gradually decay. According to this evolution, the typical synchrotron photon energy also decreases with time. The time-integrated spectrum forms the power-law shape for the high-energy region. We discuss the required evolutions of the turbulence and magnetic field to produce a typical Band function. Although the decay of the turbulence is highly uncertain, recent numerical simulations for decaying turbulence seem comparatively positive for the stochastic acceleration model. Another condition required to reconcile observations is a much shorter duration of the stochastic acceleration than the dynamical timescale.",15,[],1

Search for the narrow spectral line produced by the decay of the dark matter sterile neutrino in the spectra of dwarf spheroidal galaxies with X-IFU will explore the whole allowed range masses and mixing angles of the nuMSM lightest sterile neutrino and in this way either to find the dark matter signal or rule out the nuMSM model.",15,[],1
1510.02084,astro-ph,"The main progenitor candidate of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is white dwarfs in binary systems where the companion star is another white dwarf (double degenerate system) or a less evolved non-degenerate star with R* >~ 0.1 Rsun (single degenerate system), but no direct observational evidence exists that tells which progenitor system is more common. Recent studies suggest that the light curve of a supernova shortly after its explosion can be used to set a limit on the progenitor size, R*. Here, we report a high cadence monitoring observation of SN 2015F, a normal SN Ia, in the galaxy NGC 2442 starting about 84 days before the first light time. With our daily cadence data, we catch the emergence of the radioactively powered light curve, but more importantly detect with a > 97.4% confidence a possible dim precursor emission that appears at roughly 1.5 days before the rise of the radioactively powered emission. The signal is consistent with theoretical expectations for a progenitor system involving a companion star with R* = ~0.1 -- 1 Rsun or a prompt explosion of a double degenerate system, but inconsistent with a typically invoked size of white dwarf progenitor of R* ~ 0.01 Rsun. Upper limits on the precursor emission also constrain the progenitor size to be R* < 0.1 Rsun, and a companion star size of R* < ~1.0 Rsun, excluding a very large companion star in the progenitor system. Additionally, we find that the distance to SN 2015F is 23.9 -0.4 Mpc.",15,[],1
1509.07261,astro-ph,"Standard accretion disc model relies upon several assumptions, the most important of which is geometrical thinness. Whenever this condition is violated, new physical effects become important such as radial energy advection and mass loss from the disc. These effects are important, for instance, for large mass accretion rates when the disc approaches its local Eddington limit. In this work, we study the upper limits for standard accretion disc approximation and find the corrections to the standard model that should be considered in any model aiming on reproducing the transition to super-Eddington accretion regime. First, we find that for thin accretion disc, taking into account relativistic corrections allows to increase the local Eddington limit by about a factor of two due to stronger gravity in General Relativity (GR). However, violation of the local Eddington limit also means large disc thickness. To consider consequently the disc thickness effects, one should make assumptions upon the two-dimensional rotation law of the disc. For rotation frequency constant on cylinders equation, vertical gravity becomes stronger with height on spheres of constant radius. On the other hand, effects of radial flux advection increase the flux density in the inner parts of the disc and lower the Eddington limit. In general, the effects connected to disc thickness tend to increase the local Eddington limit even more. The efficiency of accretion is however decreased by advection effects by about a factor of several.",15,[],1

We performed follow-up observations of selected novae and dwarf novae in a search of the second component in the gamma-ray spectrum.

We constrain the cosmological parameters in the EDE cosmology using recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background and baryon acoustic oscillations. The best-fitting models favour no EDE; here we consider extreme examples which are in mild tension with current observations in order to explore the observational consequences of a maximally allowed amount of EDE. We study the non-linear evolution of cosmic structure in EDE cosmologies using large volume N-body simulations. Many large-scale structure statistics are found to be very similar between the equation cold dark matter (equationCDM) and EDE models.

1510.02485,astro-ph,"Distant BL Lacertae objects emit equation rays which interact with the extragalactic background light (EBL), creating electron-positron pairs, and reducing the flux measured by ground-based imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) at very-high energies (VHE). These pairs can Compton-scatter the cosmic microwave background, creating a equation-ray signature at slightly lower energies observable by the \fermi\ Large Area Telescope (LAT). This signal is strongly dependent on the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) strength (equation) and its coherence length (equation). We use IACT spectra taken from the literature for 5 VHE-detected BL Lac objects, and combine it with LAT spectra for these sources to constrain these IGMF parameters. Low equation values can be ruled out by the constraint that the cascade flux cannot exceed that observed by the LAT. High values of equation can be ruled out from the constraint that the EBL-deabsorbed IACT spectrum cannot be greater than the LAT spectrum extrapolated into the VHE band, unless the cascade spectrum contributes a sizable fraction of the LAT flux.

This approach extends our understanding more than two orders of magnitude lower in stellar mass than is currently possible by direct imaging. We find the faint end slopes of the mass functions to be alpha= -1.42(0.07/-0.05) at z = 2 and alpha = -1.57(0.06/-0.06) at z = 5, and show the slope only weakly evolves from z = 5 to z = 0. Our findings are in stark contrast to a number of direct detection studies that suggest slopes as steep as alpha = -1.9 at these epochs. Such a steep slope would result in an order of magnitude too many luminous Milky Way satellites in a mass regime that is observationally complete (Mstar > 2*105 Msun at z = 0). The most recent studies from ZFOURGE and CANDELS also suggest flatter faint end slopes that are consistent with our results, but with a lower degree of precision.

1501.07148,astro-ph,"A large number of terrestrial planets in the classical habitable zone of stars of different spectral types has already been discovered and many are expected to be discovered in near future. However, owing to the lack of knowledge on the atmospheric properties, the ambient environment of such planets are unknown. It is known that sufficient amount of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) radiation from the star can drive hydrodynamic outflow of hydrogen that may drag heavier species from the atmosphere of the planet. If the rate of mass loss is sufficiently high then substantial amount of volatiles would escape causing the planet to become uninhabitable. Considering energy-limited hydrodynamical mass loss with an escape rate that causes oxygen to escape alongwith hydrogen, I present an upper limit for the ratio between the EUV and the bolometric luminosities of stars which constrains the habitability of planets around them. Application of the limit to planet-hosting stars with known EUV luminosities implies that many M-type of stars should not have habitable planets around them.",15,[],1

The median LyC production efficiency is QLyC = (6/-2)x1060 LyC photons per Msun of star formation (range [3.1-9.4]x1060) corresponding to a revised calibration of 1053.3/-0.2 photons/s per Msun/yr. Efficiencies in the helium continua are QHeI ~ 1060 photons/Msun and QHeII ~ 1056 photons/Msun at solar metallicity and larger at low metallicity. The critical star formation rate needed to maintain reionization against recombinations at z = 7 is rhoSFR = (0.012 Msun/yr/Mpc3) [(1z)/8]3 [(CH /3) (0.2/ fesc) for fiducial values of IGM clumping factor CH = 3 and LyC escape fraction fesc = 0.2.

These theories further predict that at low-z, a significant fraction of the baryons will be shock-heated to equationK yielding a warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), but whose actual existence has eluded a firm observational confirmation. We present a novel experiment to detect the WHIM, by targeting the putative filaments connecting galaxy clusters. We use HST/COS to observe a remarkable QSO sightline that passes within equation Mpc from the 7 inter-cluster axes connecting 7 independent cluster-pairs at redshifts equation. We find tentative excesses of total HI, narrow HI (NLA; Doppler parameters equation km/s), broad HI (BLA; equation km/s) and OVI absorption lines within rest-frame velocities of equation km/s from the cluster-pairs redshifts, corresponding to equation, equation, equation and equation times their field expectations, respectively. Although the excess of OVI likely comes from gas close to individual galaxies, we conclude that most of the excesses of NLAs and BLAs are truly intergalactic. We find that the covering fractions, equation, of BLAs close to cluster-pairs are equation times higher than the random expectation (at the equation c.l.), whereas the equation of NLAs and OVI are not significantly enhanced. We argue that a larger relative excess of BLAs compared to those of NLAs close to cluster-pairs may be a signature of the WHIM in inter-cluster filaments.

In particular, we analyse the redshift dependence of the fine structure constant and the proton to electron mass ratio in each of these scenarios. When the absorption lines belong to unscreened regions of space such as dwarf galaxies, a time variation would be present for chameleons. For both K-mouflage and Vainshtein mechanisms, the cosmological time variation of the scalar field is not suppressed in both unscreened and screened environments, therefore enhancing the variation of constants and their detection prospect. We also consider the time variation of the redshift of distant objects using their spectrocopic velocities. We find that models of the K-mouflage and Vainshtein types have very different spectroscopic velocities as a function of redshift and that their differences with the equation-CDM template should be within reach of the future ELT- HIRES observations.",15,[],1

S34 oscillates in latitude between 32\deg S and 36.5\deg S, with a period of equation1000 days, which may be a result of a non-barotropic Rossby wave. It also varied its longitudinal drift rate between -20\deg /day and -31\deg /day in approximate accord with the latitudinal gradient in the zonal wind profile, exhibiting behavior similar to that of the DS2 feature observed on Neptune (Sromovsky et al., Icarus 105, 110-141, 1993).

When neglecting rotation, we find that no single isochrone can fit the entire upper main sequence at the clusters' spectroscopic metallicity: more massive stars appear, at high significance, to be younger than less massive stars. This discrepancy is consistent with earlier studies, but vanishes when including stellar rotation. The entire upper main sequence of both clusters is very well-fit by a distribution of 800 Myr-old stars with the spectroscopically measured [Fe/H]=0.12. The increase over the consensus age of ~600-650 Myr is due both to the revised Solar metallicity (from equation to equation) and to the lengthening of main sequence lifetimes and increase in luminosities with rapid rotation. Our results show that rotation can remove the need for large age spreads in intermediate age clusters, and that these clusters may be significantly older than is commonly accepted.

Estimating distances is an inference problem in which the use of prior assumptions is unavoidable. I investigate the properties and performance of various priors and examine their implications. A supposed uninformative uniform prior in distance is shown to give very poor distance estimates (large bias and variance). Any prior with a sharp cut-off at some distance has similar problems. The choice of prior depends on the information one has available - and is willing to use - concerning, for example, the survey and the Galaxy.

Fabry-Perot interferometry has been used to map its Ha distribution and kinematics at unprecedented angular resolution (<3') and resolving power (12600), with the 1.6m telescope at the Observatoire du Mont Megantic. The ionized gas distribution follows a complex, large-scale spiral structure, unsurprisingly coincident with the already-known spiral structures of the neutral and molecular gas discs. The kinematical analysis of the velocity field shows that the rotation center of the Ha disc is distant from the photometric center by 170 pc (sky projected distance) and that the kinematical major-axis position angle and disc inclination are in excellent agreement with photometric values. The Ha rotation curve agrees very well with the HI rotation curves for 0 < R < 6.5 kpc, but the Ha velocities are 10-20 km/s higher for R > 6.5 kpc. The reason for this discrepancy is not well understood. The velocity dispersion profile is relatively flat around 16 km/s, which is at the low end of velocity dispersions of nearby star-forming galactic discs.

Low-frequency imaging at 624 MHz and pulsar observations at 624 and 1404 MHz towards G15.40.1 were carried out with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT).

To characterize the neutral hydrogen medium (HI) towards G15.40.1, we used data from the Southern Galactic Plane Survey. We modelled the spectral energy distribution using both hadronic and leptonic scenarios. From the combination of the new GMRT observations with existing data, we derived a continuum spectral index alpha=-0.62-0.03 for the whole remnant. The local synchrotron spectra of G15.40.1, calculated from the combination of the GMRT data with 330 MHz observations from the VLA, tends to be flatter in the central part of the remnant, accompanying the region where the blast wave is impinging molecular gas. No spectral index trace was found indicating the radio counterpart to the pulsar wind nebula proposed from X-ray observations. In addition, the search for radio pulsations yielded negative results. Emission at far-infrared wavelengths is observed in the region where the SNR shock is interacting with dense molecular clumps.

Among the CTA design key requirements to the RTA system, the most challenging is the generation of alerts within 30 seconds from the last acquired event, while obtaining a flux sensitivity not worse than the one of the final analysis by more than a factor of 3. A dedicated software and hardware architecture for the RTA pipeline must be designed and tested. We present comparison of OpenCL solutions using different kind of devices like CPUs, Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) and Field Programmable Array (FPGA) cards for the Real-Time data reduction of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) triggered data.",15,[],1
1505.06732,astro-ph,"The formation of planetesimals requires that primordial dust grains grow from micron- to km-sized bodies. Dust traps caused by gas pressure maxima have been proposed as regions where grains can concentrate and grow fast enough to form planetesimals, before radially migrating onto the star. We report new VLA Ka & Ku observations of the protoplanetary disk around the Herbig Ae/Be star MWC 758. The Ka image shows a compact emission region in the outer disk indicating a strong concentration of big dust grains. Tracing smaller grains, archival ALMA data in band 7 continuum shows extended disk emission with an intensity maximum to the north-west of the central star, which matches the VLA clump position. The compactness of the Ka emission is expected in the context of dust trapping, as big grains are trapped more easily than smaller grains in gas pressure maxima. We develop a non-axisymmetric parametric model inspired by a steady state vortex solution with parameters adequately selected to reproduce the observations, including the spectral energy distribution. Finally, we compare the radio continuum with SPHERE scattered light data. The ALMA continuum spatially coincides with a spiral-like feature seen in scattered light, while the VLA clump is offset from the scattered light maximum. Moreover, the ALMA map shows a decrement that matches a region devoid of scattered polarised emission. Continuum observations at a different wavelength are necessary to conclude if the VLA-ALMA difference is an opacity or a real dust segregation.",15,[],1
1508.00338,astro-ph,"This article investigates the problem of estimating stellar atmospheric parameters from spectra. Feature extraction is a key procedure in estimating stellar parameters automatically. We propose a scheme for spectral feature extraction and atmospheric parameter estimation using the following three procedures: firstly, learn a set of basic structure elements (BSE) from stellar spectra using an autoencoder; secondly, extract representative features from stellar spectra based on the learned BSEs through some procedures of convolution and pooling; thirdly, estimate stellar parameters (equation, logequation, [Fe/H]) using a back-propagation (BP) network. The proposed scheme has been evaluated on both real spectra from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)/Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE) and synthetic spectra calculated from Kurucz's new opacity distribution function (NEWODF) models. The best mean absolute errors (MAEs) are 0.0060 dex for logequation, 0.1978 dex for logequation and 0.1770 dex for [Fe/H] for the real spectra and 0.0004 dex for logequation, 0.0145 dex for logequation and 0.0070 dex for [Fe/H] for the synthetic spectra.",15,[],1
1503.04901,astro-ph,"We investigate the formation and evolution of a first core, protostar, and circumstellar disc with a three-dimensional non-ideal (including both Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion) radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We found that the magnetic flux is largely removed by magnetic diffusion in the first core phase and that the plasma equation of the centre of the first core becomes large, equation. Thus, proper treatment of first core phase is crucial in investigating the formation of protostar and disc. On the other hand, in an ideal simulation, equation at the centre of the first core. The simulations with magnetic diffusion show that the circumstellar disc forms at almost the same time of protostar formation even with a relatively strong initial magnetic field (the value for the initial mass-to-flux ratio of the cloud core relative to the critical value is equation). The disc has a radius of equation AU at the protostar formation epoch. We confirm that the disc is rotationally supported. We also show that the disc is massive (equation) and that gravitational instability may play an important role in the subsequent disc evolution.",15,[],1
1502.05525,astro-ph,"The Adaptive Optics Facility (AOF) project envisages transforming one of the VLT units into an adaptive telescope and providing its ESO (European Southern Observatory) second generation instruments with turbulence corrected wavefronts. For MUSE and HAWK-I this correction will be achieved through the GALACSI and GRAAL AO modules working in conjunction with a 1170 actuators Deformable Secondary Mirror (DSM) and the new Laser Guide Star Facility (4LGSF). Multiple wavefront sensors will enable GLAO and LTAO capabilities, whose performance can greatly benefit from a knowledge about the stratification of the turbulence in the atmosphere. This work, totally based on end-to-end simulations, describes the validation tests conducted on a Cn2 profiler adapted for the AOF specifications. Because an absolute profile calibration is strongly dependent on a reliable knowledge of turbulence parameters r0 and L0, the tests presented here refer only to normalized output profiles. Uncertainties in the input parameters inherent to the code are tested as well as the profiler response to different turbulence distributions. It adopts a correction for the unseen turbulence, critical for the GRAAL mode, and highlights the effects of masking out parts of the corrected wavefront on the results. Simulations of data with typical turbulence profiles from Paranal were input to the profiler, showing that it is possible to identify reliably the input features for all the AOF modes.",15,[],1
1502.05858,astro-ph,"In this paper we present the first observations of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud performed as part of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) Gould Belt Survey (GBS) with the SCUBA-2 instrument. We demonstrate methods for combining these data with previous HARP CO, Herschel, and IRAM NequationHequation observations in order to accurately quantify the properties of the SCUBA-2 sources in Ophiuchus. We produce a catalogue of all of the sources found by SCUBA-2. We separate these into protostars and starless cores. We list all of the starless cores and perform a full virial analysis, including external pressure. This is the first time that external pressure has been included in this level of detail. We find that the majority of our cores are either bound or virialised. Gravitational energy and external pressure are on average of a similar order of magnitude, but with some variation from region to region. We find that cores in the Oph A region are gravitationally bound prestellar cores, while cores in the Oph C and E regions are pressure-confined. We determine that NequationHequation is a good tracer of the bound material of prestellar cores, although we find some evidence for NequationHequation freeze-out at the very highest core densities. We find that non-thermal linewidths decrease substantially between the gas traced by CequationO and that traced by NequationHequation, indicating the dissipation of turbulence at higher densities. We find that the critical Bonnor-Ebert stability criterion is not a good indicator of the boundedness of our cores. We detect the pre-brown dwarf candidate Oph B-11 and find a flux density and mass consistent with previous work. We discuss regional variations in the nature of the cores and find further support for our previous hypothesis of a global evolutionary gradient across the cloud from southwest to northeast, indicating sequential star formation across the region.",15,[],1
1507.04092,astro-ph,"Using star-forming galaxies sample in the nearby Universe (0.02<z<0.10) selected from the SDSS (DR7) and GALEX all-sky survey (GR5), we present a new empirical calibration for predicting dust extinction of galaxies from H-alpha-to-FUV flux ratio. We find that the H-alpha dust extinction (A(Ha)) derived with H-alpha/H-beta ratio (Balmer decrement) increases with increasing H-alpha/UV ratio as expected, but there remains a considerable scatter around the relation, which is largely dependent on stellar mass and/or H-alpha equivalent width (EW(Ha)). At fixed H-alpha/UV ratio, galaxies with higher stellar mass (or galaxies with lower EW(Ha)) tend to be more highly obscured by dust. We quantify this trend and establish an empirical calibration for predicting A(Ha) with a combination of H-alpha/UV ratio, stellar mass and EW(Ha), with which we can successfully reduce the systematic uncertainties accompanying the simple H-alpha/UV approach by ~15-30%. The new recipes proposed in this study will provide a convenient tool for predicting dust extinction level of galaxies particularly when Balmer decrement is not available. By comparing A(Ha) (derived with Balmer decrement) and A(UV) (derived with IR/UV luminosity ratio) for a subsample of galaxies for which AKARI FIR photometry is available, we demonstrate that more massive galaxies tend to have higher extra extinction towards the nebular regions compared to the stellar continuum light. Considering recent studies reporting smaller extra extinction towards nebular regions for high-redshift galaxies, we argue that the dust geometry within high-redshift galaxies resemble more like low-mass galaxies in the nearby Universe.",15,[],1
1510.03449,astro-ph,"We have spent 50 years in heated discussion over which populations of solar energetic particles (SEPs) are accelerated at flares and which by shock waves driven out from the Sun by coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The association of the large ""gradual"" SEP events with shock acceleration is supported by the extensive spatial distribution of SEPs and by the delayed acceleration of the particles. The relative abundances of the elements in these gradual events are a measure of those in the ambient solar corona, differing from those in the photosphere by a widely-observed function of the first ionization potential (FIP) of the elements. SEP events we call ""impulsive"", the traditional ""3He-rich"" events with enhanced heavy-element abundances, are associated with type III radio bursts, flares, and narrow CMEs; they selectively populate flux tubes that thread a localized source, and they are fit to new particle-in-cell models of magnetic reconnection on open field lines as found in solar jets. These models help explain the strong enhancements seen in heavy elements as a power (of 2 - 8) in the mass-to-charge ratio A/Q throughout the periodic table from He to Pb. A study of the temperature dependence of A/Q shows that the source plasma in impulsive SEP events must lie in the range of 2-4 MK to explain the pattern of abundances. This is much lower than the temperatures of >10 MK seen on closed loops in solar flares. Recent studies of A/Q-dependent enhancements or suppressions from scattering during transport show source plasma temperatures in gradual SEP events to be 0.8-1.6 MK in 69% of the events, i.e. coronal plasma; 24% of the events show reaccelerated impulsive-event material.",15,[],1
1509.08558,astro-ph,"In this paper, we use two model-independent methods to standardize long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using the equation correlation, where equation is the isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray energy and equation is the spectral peak energy. We update 42 long GRBs and try to make constraint on cosmological parameters. The full sample contains 151 long GRBs with redshifts from 0.0331 to 8.2. The first method is the simultaneous fitting method. The extrinsic scatter equation is taken into account and assigned to the parameter equation. The best-fitting values are equation, equation, equation and equation in the flat equationCDM model. The constraint on equation is equation at the 1equation confidence level. If reduced equation method is used, the best-fit results are equation, equation and equation. The second method is using type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to calibrate the equation correlation. We calibrate 90 high-redshift GRBs in the redshift range from 1.44 to 8.1. The cosmological constraints from these 90 GRBs are equation for flat equationCDM, and equation and equation for non-flat equationCDM. For the combination of GRB and SNe Ia sample, we obtain equation and equation for the flat equationCDM, and for the non-flat equationCDM, the results are equation, equation and equation. These results from calibrated GRBs are consistent with that of SNe Ia. Meanwhile, the combined data can improve cosmological constraints significantly, comparing to SNe Ia alone. Our results show that the equation correlation is promising to probe the high-redshift universe.",15,[],1

Two key ingredients are needed to explain such emissions, namely magnetic fields and relativistic particles. Particles can be accelerated to relativistic speeds by Fermi processes at strong shocks. Therefore, strong synchrotron emission is usually attributed to WR binarity. The magnetic field may also be amplified at shocks, however the actual picture of the magnetic field geometry, intensity, and its role on the acceleration of particles at WR binary systems is still unclear.

1509.00330,astro-ph,"NGC253 is the nearest spiral galaxy with a nuclear starburst which becomes the best candidate to study the relationship between starburst and AGN activity. However, this central region is veiled by large amounts of dust, and it has been so far unclear which is the true dynamical nucleus. The near infrared spectroscopy could be advantageous in order to shed light on the true nucleus identity. Using Flamingos-2 at Gemini South we have taken deep K-band spectra along the major axis and through the brightest infrared source. We present evidence showing that the brightest near infrared and mid infrared source in the central region, already known as radio source TH7 and so far considered just a stellar supercluster, in fact, presents various symptoms of a genuine galactic nucleus. Therefore, it should be considered a valid nucleus candidate. It is the most massive compact infrared object in the central region, located at 2.0"" of the symmetry center of the galactic bar. Moreover, our data indicate that this object is surrounded by a large circumnuclear stellar disk and it is also located at the rotation center of the large molecular gas disk of NGC 253. Furthermore, a kinematic residual appears in the H2 rotation curve with a sinusoidal shape consistent with an outflow centered in the candidate nucleus position. The maximum outflow velocity is located about 14 pc from TH7, which is consistent with the radius of a shell detected around the nucleus candidate observed at 18.3 letterm (Qa) and 12.8 letterm ([NeII]) with T-ReCS. Also, the Brgamma emission line profile is blue-shifted and this emission line has also the highest equivalent width at this position. All these evidences point out TH7 as the best candidate to be the galactic nucleus of NGC 253.",15,[],1
1507.05097,astro-ph,"The Kepler planet sample can only be used to reconstruct the underlying planet occurrence rate if the detection efficiency of the Kepler pipeline is known, here we present the results of a second experiment aimed at characterising this detection efficiency. We inject simulated transiting planet signals into the pixel data of ~10,000 targets, spanning one year of observations, and process the pixels as normal. We compare the set of detections made by the pipeline with the expectation from the set of simulated planets, and construct a sensitivity curve of signal recovery as a function of the signal-to-noise of the simulated transit signal train. The sensitivity curve does not meet the hypothetical maximum detection efficiency, however it is not as pessimistic as some of the published estimates of the detection efficiency. For the FGK stars in our sample, the sensitivity curve is well fit by a gamma function with the coefficients a = 4.35 and b = 1.05. We also find that the pipeline algorithms recover the depths and periods of the injected signals with very high fidelity, especially for periods longer than 10 days. We perform a simplified occurrence rate calculation using the measured detection efficiency compared to previous assumptions of the detection efficiency found in the literature to demonstrate the systematic error introduced into the resulting occurrence rates. The discrepancies in the calculated occurrence rates may go some way towards reconciling some of the inconsistencies found in the literature.",15,[],1
1504.01398,astro-ph,"We present the first -- of a series -- study of the evolution of galaxies in compact groups over the past 3 Gyr. This paper focuses on the evolution of the nuclear activity and how it has been affected by the dense environment of the groups. Our analysis is based on the largest multiwavelength compact group sample to-date, containing complete ultraviolet-to-infrared (UV-to-IR) photometry for 1,770 isolated groups (7,417 galaxies). We classified the nuclear activity of the galaxies based on optical emission line and mid-infrared diagnostic methods, as well as using spectral energy distribution fitting. We observe a 15% increase on the number of the AGN-hosting late-type galaxies found in dynamically old groups, over the past 3 Gyr, accompanied by the corresponding decrease of their circumnuclear star formation. Comparing our compact group results with those of local isolated field and interacting pair galaxies, we find no differences in the AGN at the same redshift range. Based on both optical and mid-IR colour classifications, we report the absence of Seyfert 1 nuclei and we attribute this to the low accretion rates, caused by the depletion of gas. We propose that the observed increase of LINER and Seyfert 2 nuclei (at low-z's), in the early-type galaxies of the dynamically young groups, is due to the morphological transformation of lenticular into elliptical galaxies. Finally, we show that at any given stellar mass, galaxies found in dynamically old groups are more likely to host an AGN. Our findings suggest that the depletion of gas, due to past star formation and tidal stripping, is the major mechanism driving the evolution of the nuclear activity in compact groups of galaxies.",15,[],1

1501.07115,astro-ph,"The recent IceCube discovery of 0.1-1 PeV neutrinos of astrophysical origin opens up a new era for high-energy astrophysics. Although there are various astrophysical candidate sources, a firm association of the detected neutrinos with one (or more) of them is still lacking. A recent analysis of plausible astrophysical counterparts within the error circles of IceCube events showed that likely counterparts for nine of the IceCube neutrinos include mostly BL Lacs, among which Mrk 421. Motivated by this result and a previous independent analysis on the neutrino emission from Mrk 421, we test the BL Lac-neutrino connection in the context of a specific theoretical model for BL Lac emission. We model the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the BL Lacs selected as counterparts of the IceCube neutrinos using a one-zone leptohadronic model and mostly nearly simultaneous data. The neutrino flux for each BL Lac is self-consistently calculated, using photon and proton distributions specifically derived for every individual source. We find that the SEDs of the sample, although different in shape and flux, are all well fitted by the model using reasonable parameter values. Moreover, the model-predicted neutrino flux and energy for these sources are of the same order of magnitude as those of the IceCube neutrinos. In two cases, namely Mrk 421 and H 1914-194, we find a suggestively good agreement between the model prediction and the detected neutrino flux. Our predictions for all the BL Lacs of the sample are in the range to be confirmed or disputed by IceCube in the next few years of data sampling.",15,[],1

We found the following peculiarities of the targets: (a) the components of KIC 9474969 have almost the same temperatures while their radii and masses differ by a factor around 2.5; (b) KIC 6949550 reveals semi-regular light variations with an amplitude of 0.004 and a period around 7 d which are modulated by long-term variations; (c) KIC 6220470, KIC 11071207, and KIC 9474969 exhibit tidally induced 'hump' around the periastron.

For a Euclid-like survey, these spectra would have amplitudes smaller than the weak lensing effect on nonlinear structures, but would constitute an important systematic. Computing estimation biases for cosmological parameters derived from an alignment-contaminated survey suggests biases of equation for the dark energy equation of state parameter equation, equation for the matter density equation and equation for the spectrum normalisation equation. Intrinsic alignments yield a signal which is easily observable with a survey similar to Euclid: While not independent, significances for estimates of each of the four spectra reach values of tens of equation if weak lensing and shape noise are considered as noise sources, which suggests relative uncertainties on alignment parameters at the percent level.",15,[],1

We identify 62 sources down to the 5-sigma point-source sensitivity limit in our ALMA sample (sigma~0.2mJy), of which 6 are strongly lensed (showing multiple images) and 36 experience significant amplification (mu>1.1). To characterize the properties of the ALMA sources, we introduce and make use of uvmcmcfit, a publicly available Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis tool for interferometric observations of lensed galaxies. Our lens models tentatively favor intrinsic number counts for DSFGs with a steep fall off above 8mJy at 880um. Nearly 70% of the Herschel sources comprise multiple ALMA counterparts, consistent with previous research indicating that the multiplicity rate is high in bright sub-mm sources. Our ALMA sources are located significantly closer to each other than expected based on results from theoretical models as well as fainter DSFGs identified in the LABOCA ECDFS Submillimeter Survey.

1505.07504,astro-ph,"Most field stars will have encountered the highest stellar density and hence the largest number of interactions in their birth environment. Yet the stellar dynamics during this crucial phase are poorly understood. Here we analyze the radial velocities measured for 152 out of 380 observed stars in the 2-6 Myr old star cluster IC 348 as part of the SDSS-III APOGEE. The radial velocity distribution of these stars is fitted with one or two Gaussians, convolved with the measurement uncertainties including binary orbital motions. Including a second Gaussian improves the fit; the high-velocity outliers that are best fit by this second component may either (1) be contaminants from the nearby Perseus OB2 association, (2) be a halo of ejected or dispersing stars from IC 348, or (3) reflect that IC 348 has not relaxed to a Gaussian velocity distribution. We measure a velocity dispersion for IC 348 of equation km sequation (or equation km sequation if two Gaussians are fitted), which implies a supervirial state, unless the gas contributes more to the gravitational potential than expected. No evidence is found for a dependence of this velocity dispersion on distance from the cluster center or stellar mass. We also find that stars with lower extinction (in the front of the cloud) tend to be redshifted compared with stars with somewhat higher extinction (towards the back of the cloud). This data suggests that the stars in IC 348 are converging along the line of sight. We show that this correlation between radial velocity and extinction is unlikely to be spuriously caused by the small cluster rotation of equation km sequation arcminequation or by correlations between the radial velocities of neighboring stars. This signature, if confirmed, will be the first detection of line-of-sight convergence in a star cluster(...)",15,[],1

1501.01151,astro-ph,"The properties of magnetic fields forming an extended plage region in AR 10953 were investigated. Stokes spectra of the Fe I line pair at 6302 \AA recorded by the spectropolarimeter aboard the Hinode satellite were inverted using the SPINOR code. The code performed a 2D spatially coupled inversion on the Stokes spectra, allowing the retrieval of gradients in optical depth within the atmosphere of each pixel, whilst accounting for the effects of the instrument's PSF. Consequently, no magnetic filling factor was needed. The inversion results reveal that plage is composed of magnetic flux concentrations (MFCs) with typical field strengths of 1520 G at log(letter)=-0.9 and inclinations of 10-15 degrees. The MFCs expand by forming magnetic canopies composed of weaker and more inclined magnetic fields. The expansion and average temperature stratification of isolated MFCs can be approximated well with an empirical plage thin flux-tube model. The highest temperatures of MFCs are located at their edges in all log(letter) layers. Whilst the plasma inside MFCs is nearly at rest, each is surrounded by a ring of downflows of on average 2.4 km/s at log(letter)=0 and peak velocities of up to 10 km/s, which are supersonic. The downflow ring of an MFC weakens and shifts outwards with height, tracing the MFC's expansion. Such downflow rings often harbour magnetic patches of opposite polarity to that of the main MFC with typical field strengths below 300 G at log(letter)=0. These opposite polarity patches are situated beneath the canopy of their main MFC. We found evidence of a strong broadening of the Stokes profiles in MFCs and particularly in the downflow rings surrounding MFCs (expressed by a microturbulence in the inversion). This indicates the presence of strong unresolved velocities. Larger magnetic structures such as sunspots cause the field of nearby MFCs to be more inclined.",15,[],1

The particle-like dynamics of these guided solitary waves provides potentially profitable features for their implementation in atomtronic circuits, and play a key role in the generation of metastable loop currents. Based on the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation we calculate the dispersion relations of moving solitary waves and their modes of dynamical instability. The dispersion relations reveal a complex crossing and bifurcation scenario. For stationary structures we find that for equation the solitonic vortex is the only stable solitary wave. More complex Chladni solitons still have weaker instabilities than planar dark solitons and may be seen as transient structures in experiments. Fully time-dependent simulations illustrate typical decay scenarios, which may result in the generation of multiple separated solitonic vortices.",15,[],8

1505.07575,cond-mat,"We investigate the dynamics of a phonon-mediated superconductor driven out of equilibrium. The electronic hopping amplitude is ramped down in time, resulting in an increased electronic density of states. The dynamics of the coupled electron-phonon model is investigated by solving Migdal-Eliashberg equations for the double-time Keldysh Green's functions. The increase of the density of states near the Fermi level leads to an enhancement of superconductivity when the system thermalizes to the new state at the same temperature. We provide a time- and momentum-resolved view on this thermalization process, and show that it involves fast processes associated with single-particle scattering and much slower dynamics associated with the superconducting order parameter. The importance of electron-phonon coupling for the rapid enhancement and the efficient thermalization of superconductivity is demonstrated, and the results are compared to a BCS time-dependent mean-field approximation.",15,[],8
1507.01389,cond-mat,"We consider analytically and numerically an anisotropic spin-equation delta-chain (sawtooth chain) with nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions. For certain values of the interactions a lowest one-particle band becomes flat and there is a class of localized-magnon eigenstates which form a ground state with a macroscopic degeneracy. In this case the model depends on a single parameter which can be chosen as the anisotropy of the exchange interactions. When this parameter changes from zero to infinity the model interpolates between the one-dimensional isotropic ferromagnet and the frustrated Ising model on the delta-chain. It is shown that the low-temperature thermodynamic properties in these limiting cases are governed by the specific structure of the excitation spectrum. In particular, the specific heat has one or infinite number of low-temperature maxima for the small or the large anisotropy parameter, correspondingly. Numerical calculations of finite chains demonstrate that this behavior is generic for definite values of the anisotropy parameter.",15,[],8
1510.04167,cond-mat,"We present the results of elastic and inelastic neutron scattering measurements on non-superconducting Ba(FeequationCuequation)equationAsequation, a composition close to a quantum critical point between AFM ordered and paramagnetic phases. By comparing these results with the spin fluctuations in the low Cu composition as well as the parent compound BaFeequationAsequation and superconducting Ba(FeequationNiequation)equationAsequation compounds, we demonstrate that paramagnon-like spin fluctuations are evident in the antiferromagnetically ordered state of Ba(FeequationCuequation)equationAsequation, which is distinct from the AFM-like spin fluctuations in the superconducting compounds. Our observations suggest that Cu substitution decouples the interaction between quasiparticles and the spin fluctuations. We also show that the spin-spin correlation length, equation, increases rapidly as the temperature is lowered and find equation scaling behavior, the hallmark of quantum criticality, at an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point.",15,[],8
1503.03645,cond-mat,"We have theoretically analyzed coherent nuclear-spin dynamics induced by electron transport through a quantum-dot spin valve. The hyperfine interaction between electron and nuclear spins in a quantum dot allows for the transfer of angular momentum from spin-polarized electrons injected from ferromagnetic or half-metal leads to the nuclear spin system under a finite voltage bias. Accounting for a local nuclear-spin dephasing process prevents the system from becoming stuck in collective dark states, allowing a large nuclear polarization to be built up in the long-time limit. After reaching a steady state, reversing the voltage bias induces a transient current response as the nuclear polarization is reversed. Long-range nuclear-spin coherence leads to a strong enhancement of spin-flip transition rates (by an amount proportional to the number of nuclear spins) and is revealed by an intense current burst, analogous to superradiant light emission. The crossover to a regime with incoherent spin flips occurs on a relatively long time scale, on the order of the single-nuclear-spin dephasing time, which can be much longer than the time scale for the superradiant current burst. This conclusion is confirmed through a general master equation. For the two limiting regimes (coherent/incoherent spin flips) the general master equation recovers our simpler treatment based on rate equations, but is also applicable at intermediate dephasing. Throughout this work we assume uniform hyperfine couplings, which yield the strongest coherent enhancement. We propose realistic strategies, based on isotopic modulation and wavefunction engineering in core-shell nanowires, to realize this analytically solvable ""box-model"" of hyperfine couplings.",15,[],8

1501.01169,cond-mat,"The exciton spin dynamics and polarization properties of the related emission are investigated in colloidal CdSe/CdS dot-in-rod (DiR) and spherical core/shell nanocrystal (NC) ensembles by magneto-optical photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy in magnetic fields up to 15 T. It is shown that the degree of circular polarization (DCP) of the exciton emission induced by the magnetic field is affected by the NC geometry as well as the exciton fine structure and can provide information on nanorod orientation. A theory to describe the circular and linear polarization properties of the NC emission in magnetic field is developed. It takes into account phonon mediated coupling between the exciton fine structure states as well as the dielectric enhancement effect resulting from the anisotropic shell of DiR NCs. This theoretical approach is used to model the experimental results and allows us to explain most of the measured features. The spin dynamics of the dark excitons is investigated in magnetic fields by time-resolved photoluminescence. The results highlight the importance of confined acoustic phonons in the spin relaxation of dark excitons.

1510.01386,cond-mat,"I review theoretical ideas and implications of experiments for the gap structure and symmetry of the Fe-based superconductors. Unlike any other class of unconventional superconductors, one has in these systems the possibility to tune the interactions by small changes in pressure, doping or disorder. Thus, measurements of order parameter evolution with these parameters should enable a deeper understanding of the underlying interactions. I briefly review the ""standard paradigm"" for equation-wave pairing in these systems, and then focus on developments in the past several years which have challenged this picture. I discuss the reasons for the apparent close competition between pairing in s- and d-wave channels, particularly in those systems where one type of Fermi surface pocket -- hole or electron -- is missing. Observation of a transition between equation- and equation-wave symmetry, possibly via a time reversal symmetry breaking ""equation"" state, would provide an importantconfirmation of these ideas. Several proposals for detecting these novel phases are discussed, including the appearance of order parameter collective modes in Raman and optical conductivities. Transitions between two different types of equation-wave states, involving various combinations of signs on Fermi surface pockets, can also proceed through a equation-breaking ""equation"" state. I discuss recent work that suggests pairing may take place away from the Fermi level over a surprisingly large energy range, as well as the effect of glide plane symmetry of the Fe-based systems on the superconductivity, including various exotic, time and translational invariance breaking pair states that have been proposed. Finally, I address disorder issues, and the various ways systematic introduction of disorder can (and cannot) be used to extract information on gap symmetry and structure.",15,[],8
1512.03339,cond-mat,"Topological Weyl semimetals can host Weyl nodes with monopole charges in momentum space. How to detect the signature of the monopole charges in quantum transport remains a challenging topic. Here, we reveal the connection between the parity of monopole charge in topological semimetals and the quantum interference corrections to the conductivity. We show that the parity of monopole charge determines the sign of the quantum interference correction, with odd and even parity yielding the weak anti-localization and weak localization effects, respectively. This is attributed to the Berry phase difference between time-reversed trajectories circulating the Fermi sphere that encloses the monopole charges. From standard Feynman diagram calculations, we further show that the weak-field magnetoconductivity at low temperatures is proportional to equation in double-Weyl semimetals and equation in Weyl semimetals, respectively, which could be verified experimentally.",15,[],8
1506.08190,cond-mat,"A superconductor is a material that can conduct electricity with no resistance below its critical temperature (Tc). The highest Tc that has been achieved in cuprates1 is 133 K at ambient pressure2 and 164 K at high pressures3. As the nature of superconductivity in these materials has still not been explained, the prospects for a higher Tc are not clear. In contrast, the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory gives a guide for achieving high Tc and does not put bounds on Tc, all that is needed is a favorable combination of high frequency phonons, strong electron-phonon coupling, and a high density of states. These conditions can be fulfilled for metallic hydrogen and covalent compounds dominated by hydrogen4,5. Numerous calculations support this idea and predict Tc of 50-235 K for many hydrides6 but only moderate Tc=17 K has been observed experimentally7. Here we studied sulfur hydride8 where a Tc~80 K was predicted9. We found that it transforms to a metal at pressure ~90 GPa. With cooling superconductivity was found deduced from a sharp drop of the resistivity to zero and a decrease of Tc with magnetic field. The pronounce isotope shift of Tc in D2S is evidence of an electron-phonon mechanism of superconductivity that is consistent with the BCS scenario. The superconductivity has been confirmed by magnetic susceptibility measurements with Tc=203K. The high Tc superconductivity most likely is due to H3S which is formed from H2S under its decomposition under pressure. Even higher Tc, room temperature superconductivity, can be expected in other hydrogen-based materials since hydrogen atoms provide the high frequency phonon modes as well as the strong electron-phonon coupling.",15,[],8
1503.01126,cond-mat,"Broken symmetry states characterizing density waves of higher angular momentum in correlated electronic systems are intriguing objects. In the scheme of characterization by angular momentum, conventional charge and spin density waves correspond to zero angular momentum. Here we explore a class of exotic density wave states that have topological properties observed in recently discovered topological insulators. These rich topological density wave states deserve closer attention in not only high temperature superconductors but in other correlated electron states, as in heavy fermions, of which an explicit example will be discussed.The state discussed has non-trivial charge equation skyrmionic spin texture. These skyrmions can condense into a charged superfluid. Alternately, they can fractionalize into merons and anti-merons. The fractionalized particles that are confined in skyrmions in the insulating phase, can emerge at a deconfined quantum critical point, which separates the insulating and the superconducting phases. These fractional particles form a two-component spin-singlet chiral equation wave superconducting state that breaks time reversal symmetry. Possible connections of this exotic order to the superconducting state in the heavy-fermion material URuequationSiequation are suggested.

1502.04799,cond-mat,"Drude weight (equation) is a useful measure to distinguish a metal from an insulator. However, equation has not been justifiably estimated by the variation theory for long, since Millis and Coppersmith [Phys. Rev. B 43 (1991) 13770] pointed out that a variational wave function equation, which includes the key ingredient (doublon-holon binding effect) for a Mott transition, yields a positive equation (namely metallic) even in the Mott-insulating regime. We argue that, to obtain a correct equation, an imaginary part must exist in the wave function. By introducing a configuration-dependent phase factor equation to equation, Mott transitions are successfully represented by equation (equation for equation) for a normal and equation-wave pairing states; thereby, the problem of Millis and Coppersmith is settled. Generally, equation plays a pivotal role in describing current-carrying states in regimes of Mott physics. On the other hand, we show using a perturbation theory, the one-body (mean-field) part of the wave function should be complex for band insulators such as antiferromagnetic states in hypercubic lattices.",15,[],8

Solutions of the problem of the electric field potential distribution in a sample for different positions of the current contacts were found. The solutions were obtained in the form of double series and methods of their summation are presented.

1505.02335,cond-mat,"Rectified transport of active ellipsoidal particles is numerically investigated in a two-dimensional asymmetric potential. The out-of-equilibrium condition for the active particle is an intrinsic property, which can break thermodynamical equilibrium and induce the directed transport. It is found that the perfect sphere particle can facilitate the rectification, while the needlelike particle destroys the directed transport. There exist optimized values of the parameters (the self-propelled velocity, the torque acting on the body) at which the average velocity takes its maximal value. For the ellipsoidal particle with not large asymmetric parameter, the average velocity decreases with increasing the rotational diffusion rate, while for the needlelike particle (very large asymmetric parameter), the average velocity is a peaked function of the rotational diffusion rate. By introducing a finite load, particles with different shapes (or different self-propelled velocities) will move to the opposite directions, which is able to separate particles of different shapes (or different self-propelled velocities).",15,[],8
1509.02150,cond-mat,"Monolayers of semiconducting van der Waals solids, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), acquire significant electric polarization normal to the layers when placed on a substrate or in a heterogeneous stack. This causes linear coupling of electrons to electric fields normal to the layers. Irradiation at oblique incidence at frequencies above the gap causes interband transitions due to coupling to both normal and in-plane ac electric fields. The interference between the two processes leads to sizable in-plane photocurrents and valley currents. The direction and magnitude of currents is controlled by light polarization and is determined by its helical or non-helical components. The helicity-dependent ballistic current arises due to asymmetric photogeneration. The non-helical current has a ballistic contribution (dominant in sufficiently clean samples) caused by asymmetric scattering of photoexcited carriers, and a side-jump contribution.

We investigate the dynamics of the condensate fraction as well as the momentum distribution of the Bose gas following a sudden change of system parameters. Typically, the system evolves into a steady state in the long-time limit, which features an oscillating momentum distribution and a stationary condensate fraction which is dependent on the quench parameters. We investigate how different quench parameters such as the inter- and intra-species interactions and the spin-orbit-coupling parameters affect the condensate fraction in the steady state. Furthermore, we find that the time average of the oscillatory momentum distribution in the long-time limit can be described by a generalized Gibbs ensemble with two branches of momentum-dependent Gibbs temperatures.

We find that the magnetic interactions are frustrated and strongly dependent on the local environment. This results in the formation of clusters with strong bonds at certain patterns of the tilings that repeat quasiperiodically. Second, we examine the statistical mechanics of Ising spins with these RKKY interactions, using extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Although models that have frustrated interactions and lack translational invariance might be expected to display spin glass behaviour, we show that the spin system has a phase transition to low-temperature states with long-range quasiperiodic magnetic order.

1505.02601,cond-mat,"We conduct comprehensive investigations of both thermal and electrical transport properties of SnSe and SnS using first-principles calculations combined with the Boltzmann transport theory. Due to the distinct layered lattice structure, SnSe and SnS exhibit similarly anisotropic thermal and electrical behaviors. The cross-plane lattice thermal conductivity equation is 40-60% lower than the in-plane values. Extremely low equation is found for both materials because of high anharmonicity. It is suggested that nanostructuring would be difficult to further decrease equation because of the short mean free paths of dominant phonon modes (1-30 nm at 300 K) while alloying would be efficient in reducing equation considering that the relative equation contribution (equation 65%) of optical phonons is remarkably large. On the electrical side, the anisotropic electrical conductivities are mainly due to the different effective masses of holes and electrons along the equation, equation and equation axes. This leads to the highest optimal equation values along the equation axis and lowest ones along the equation axis in both equation-type materials. However, the equation-type ones exhibit the highest equations along the equation axis due to the enhancement of power factor when the chemical potential gradually approaches the secondary band valley that causes significant increase in electron mobility and density of states. SnSe exhibits larger optimal equations compared with SnS in both equation-type and equation-type materials.

The model was designed to describe complex thermodynamic systems with variable coordinating neighbors, e.g. the cross-dimensional range around the surface of a bulk materials. Classical ferromagnetic spin-1 Ising model was solved on the lattice to achieve an annealed solution via the local exact calculation technique. The model exhibits distinct spontaneous magnetization similar to the deterministic system, with however rigorous thermal fluctuations and significant singularities on the entropy behavior around the critical temperature, indicating a complex superheating and supercooling frustration in the cross-dimensional range induced by the stochasticity. The critical temperature was found to be exponentially correlated to the structural ratio equation with the coefficient fitted as 0.53187, while the ground state energy presents linear relation to equation, implying a well-defined average property according to the structural ratio.",15,[],8

At T = 10 K, the exciton spin relaxation exhibits a biexponential decay with a sub-20 ps and a >500 ps time constants, which are also reproduced by the rate-equation model assuming distinct spin-relaxation rates for hot (nonequilibrium) and cold band-edge excitons.",15,[],8
1511.02303,cond-mat,"Hot electron cooling rate P, due to acoustic phonons, is investigated in three-dimensional Dirac fermion systems at low temperature taking account of screening of electron-acoustic phonon interaction. P is studied as a function of electron temperature Te and electron concentration ne. Screening is found to suppress P very significantly for about Te < 0.5 K and its effect reduces considerably for about Te > 1K in Cd3As2 . In Bloch-Gruniesen (BG) regime, for screened (unscreened) case Te dependence is P ~ Te 9 (Te 5) and ne dependence gives P ~ ne -5/3(ne-1/3). The Te dependence is characteristics of 3D phonons and ne dependence is characteristics of 3D Dirac fermions. In BG regime, screening effect is found to enhance for larger ne. Screening is found to reduce the range of validity of BG regime temperature. Plot of P / Te 4 vs Te shows a maximum at temperature Te m which shifts to higher values for larger ne. Interesting observation is that maximum of P / Te4 is nearly same for different ne and Tem / ne 1/3 appears to be nearly constant. More importantly, we propose, the ne dependent measurements of P would provide a clearer signature to identify 3D Dirac semimetal phase.",15,[],8

1507.01647,cond-mat,"Raman spectroscopy plays a key role in studies of graphene and related carbon systems. Graphene is perhaps the most promising material of recent times for many novel applications, including electronics. In this paper, the traditional and well established Kramers-Heisenberg-Dirac (KHD) Raman scattering theory (1925-1927) is extended to crystalline graphene for the first time. It demands different phonon production mechanisms and phonon energies than does the popular ""double resonance"" Raman scattering model. The latter has never been compared to KHD. Within KHD, phonons are produced instantly along with electrons and holes, in what we term an electron-hole-phonon triplet, which does not suffer Pauli blocking. A new mechanism for double phonon production we name ""transition sliding"" explains the brightness of the 2D mode and other overtones, as a result of linear (Dirac cone) electron dispersion. Direct evidence for sliding resides in hole doping experiments performed in 2011 \citechenCrommie. Whole ranges of electronic transitions are permitted and may even constructively interfere for the same laser energy and phonon q, explaining the dispersion, bandwidth, and strength of many two phonon Raman bands. Graphene's entire Raman spectrum, including dispersive and fixed bands, missing bands not forbidden by symmetries, weak bands, overtone bands, Stokes anti-Stokes anomalies, individual bandwidths, trends with doping, and D-2D band spacing anomalies emerge naturally and directly in KHD theory.",15,[],8

1508.03777,cond-mat,"Topological quantum phase transitions intrinsically intertwine self-similarity and topology of many-electron wave-functions, and divining them is one of the most significant ways to advance understanding in condensed matter physics. Our focus is to investigate an unconventional class of the transitions between insulators and Dirac semimetals whose description is beyond conventional pseudo relativistic Dirac Hamiltonian. At the transition without the long-range Coulomb interaction, the electronic energy dispersion along one direction behaves like a relativistic particle, linear in momentum, but along the other direction it behaves like a non-relativistic particle, quadratic in momentum. Various physical systems ranging from TiOequation-VOequation heterostructure to organic material equation-(BEDT-TTF)equation Iequation under pressure have been proposed to have such anisotropic dispersion relation. Here, we discover a novel quantum criticality at the phase transition by incorporating the 1/r long-range Coulomb interaction.

Moreover, a weakly temperature-dependent positive magnetoresistance (MR) as large as 109 % and high carrier mobility up to 2950 cm2/Vs are experimentally observed at temperatures below 150 K.

We show that the electronic band structure of strained phosphorene, for experimentally accessible carrier densities and uniaxial strains, is well described by a strain-dependent decoupled electron-hole Hamiltonian. Then, employing the decoupled Hamiltonian, we consider the strain dependence of the charged-impurity-limited carrier mobility in phosphorene, for both types of carrier, arbitrary carrier density and in both armchair and zigzag directions. We show that a uniaxial tensile (compressive) strain in the normal direction enhances (weakens) the anisotropy of the carrier mobility, while a uniaxial strain in the zigzag direction acts inversely. Moreover applying a uniaxial strain in the armchair direction is shown to be ineffective on the anisotropy of the carrier mobility.

1505.06137,cond-mat,"We report on the fluidization dynamics of an attractive gel composed of non-Brownian particles made of fused silica colloids. Extensive rheology coupled to ultrasonic velocimetry allows us to characterize the global stress response together with the local dynamics of the gel during shear startup experiments. In practice, after being rejuvenated by a preshear, the gel is left to age during a time equation before being submitted to a constant shear rate equation. We investigate in detail the effects of both equation and equation on the fluidization dynamics and build a detailed state diagram of the gel response to shear startup flows. The gel may either display transient shear banding towards complete fluidization, or steady-state shear banding. In the former case, we unravel that the progressive fluidization occurs by successive steps that appear as peaks on the global stress relaxation signal. Flow imaging reveals that the shear band grows up to complete fluidization of the material by sudden avalanche-like events which are distributed heterogeneously along the vorticity direction and correlated to large peaks in the slip velocity at the moving wall. These features are robust over a wide range of values of equation and equation, although the very details of the fluidization scenario vary with equation. Finally, the critical shear rate equation that separates steady-state shear-banding from steady-state homogeneous flow depends on the width on the shear cell and exhibits a nonlinear dependence with equation. Our work brings about valuable experimental data on transient flows of attractive dispersions, highlighting the subtle interplay between shear, wall slip and aging which modeling constitutes a major challenge that has not been met yet.",15,[],8

Ward identity between the one-electron self-energy and the two-particle irreducible vertex is generally not guaranteed in the perturbation theory with only elastic scatterings. We show how the Ward identity can be established in practical approximations and how the functions from the perturbation expansion should be used to obtain a fully consistent conserving theory. We derive the low-energy asymptotics of the conserving full two-particle vertex from which we find an exact representation of the diffusion pole and of the static diffusion constant in terms of Green functions of the perturbation expansion. We illustrate the construction on the leading vertex corrections to the mean-field diffusion due to maximally-crossed diagrams responsible for weak localization.,15,[],8
1510.07219,cond-mat,"Plasma treatment of polymer films results in their electrical charging, which in turn gives rise to an increase in their surface energy. The process results in pronounced hydrophilization of the polymer surfaces.

Partial wetting, inherent for polymer films, becomes possible until the threshold surface density of the electrical charge is gained. The predictions of the theory are illustrated by plasma-treated polymer films and inflatable latex balloons. Deflating the plasma treated latex balloons resulted in an essential increase in the surface charge density of the latex. This increase switched the wetting regime from partial to complete wetting.

This is universal for time-reversal broken (respected) topological superconductors (TSCs) with an odd number of (pairs of) Majorana fermions on the boundary. Consequently, resonant Andreev reflection induced by Majorana fermions only occurs in spin-triplet channels and always injects spin-triplet Cooper pairs into the leads. This spin-triplet condensate results in a spin-orbit coupling (SOC) controlled oscillatory critical current without a equation-equation transition in the TSC/SOC-semiconductor/TSC Josephson junction.

1501.07252,cond-mat,"The influence of the in-plane anisotropy on the magnetization of a nanogranular film with perpendicular anisotropy has been studied. It is shown that if a magnetic field is tilted with respect to the film normal, a critical transition from the inhomogeneous magnetic state of granules with noncollinear directions of their moments to the homogeneous one with parallel orientation of granular magnetic moments takes place. The in-plane anisotropy is found to affect the angular dependence of the critical field. The ensemble of oriented biaxial particles is theoretically described in the double-well potential approximation. Despite the biaxial magnetic anisotropy of particles, their ensemble, if in the inhomogeneous state, is divided into two subensembles, with the magnetic moments of particles being collinear in each of them. In the critical field, a transition from the inhomogeneous state with two subensembles into the homogeneous one takes place. The results of theoretical calculations are compared with experimental data for a nanogranular Co/Al2On film with perpendicular anisotropy containing 74.5 at.% Co, which exceeds the percolation threshold.

Instead of recording a bit on an ensemble of random grains, BPM uses an array of lithographically defined isolated magnetic islands, each of which stores one bit. Fabrication of BPM is viewed as the greatest challenge for its commercialization. In this article we describe a BPM fabrication method which combines e-beam lithography, directed self-assembly of block copolymers, self-aligned double patterning, nanoimprint lithography, and ion milling to generate BPM based on CoCrPt alloys. This combination of fabrication technologies achieves feature sizes of equation, significantly smaller than what conventional semiconductor nanofabrication methods can achieve.

1505.01861,cs,"Automatically describing video content with natural language is a fundamental challenge of multimedia. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which models sequence dynamics, has attracted increasing attention on visual interpretation. However, most existing approaches generate a word locally with given previous words and the visual content, while the relationship between sentence semantics and visual content is not holistically exploited. As a result, the generated sentences may be contextually correct but the semantics (e.g., subjects, verbs or objects) are not true.   This paper presents a novel unified framework, named Long Short-Term Memory with visual-semantic Embedding (LSTM-E), which can simultaneously explore the learning of LSTM and visual-semantic embedding. The former aims to locally maximize the probability of generating the next word given previous words and visual content, while the latter is to create a visual-semantic embedding space for enforcing the relationship between the semantics of the entire sentence and visual content. Our proposed LSTM-E consists of three components: a 2-D and/or 3-D deep convolutional neural networks for learning powerful video representation, a deep RNN for generating sentences, and a joint embedding model for exploring the relationships between visual content and sentence semantics. The experiments on YouTube2Text dataset show that our proposed LSTM-E achieves to-date the best reported performance in generating natural sentences: 45.3% and 31.0% in terms of BLEU@4 and METEOR, respectively.

1506.02059,cs,"We tackle the problem of video object codetection by leveraging the weak semantic constraint implied by sentences that describe the video content. Unlike most existing work that focuses on codetecting large objects which are usually salient both in size and appearance, we can codetect objects that are small or medium sized. Our method assumes no human pose or depth information such as is required by the most recent state-of-the-art method. We employ weak semantic constraint on the codetection process by pairing the video with sentences. Although the semantic information is usually simple and weak, it can greatly boost the performance of our codetection framework by reducing the search space of the hypothesized object detections. Our experiment demonstrates an average IoU score of 0.423 on a new challenging dataset which contains 15 object classes and 150 videos with 12,509 frames in total, and an average IoU score of 0.373 on a subset of an existing dataset, originally intended for activity recognition, which contains 5 object classes and 75 videos with 8,854 frames in total.",15,[],7
1504.01561,cs,"Classifying videos according to content semantics is an important problem with a wide range of applications. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning framework for video classification, which is able to model static spatial information, short-term motion, as well as long-term temporal clues in the videos. Specifically, the spatial and the short-term motion features are extracted separately by two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). These two types of CNN-based features are then combined in a regularized feature fusion network for classification, which is able to learn and utilize feature relationships for improved performance. In addition, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks are applied on top of the two features to further model longer-term temporal clues. The main contribution of this work is the hybrid learning framework that can model several important aspects of the video data. We also show that (1) combining the spatial and the short-term motion features in the regularized fusion network is better than direct classification and fusion using the CNN with a softmax layer, and (2) the sequence-based LSTM is highly complementary to the traditional classification strategy without considering the temporal frame orders. Extensive experiments are conducted on two popular and challenging benchmarks, the UCF-101 Human Actions and the Columbia Consumer Videos (CCV). On both benchmarks, our framework achieves to-date the best reported performance: equation on the UCF-101 and equation on the CCV.",15,[],7

All potential similes and their components were first extracted using a rule-based algorithm. Then, frozen similes were identified based on reference lists of existing similes and semantic distance between the tenor and the vehicle. The results obtained tend to confirm the fact that frozen similes are not used haphazardly in literary texts. In addition, contrary to how they are often presented, frozen similes often go beyond the ground or the eventuality and the vehicle to also include the tenor.",15,[],7

The classical SSA is modified and enhanced to adapt to the unique characteristics of ELD problems, e.g., valve-point effects, multi-fuel operations, prohibited operating zones, and line losses. To demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach, five widely-adopted test systems are employed and the simulation results are compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

1506.08754,cs,"For decades, the growth and volume of digital data collection has made it challenging to digest large volumes of information and extract underlying structure. Coined 'Big Data', massive amounts of information has quite often been gathered inconsistently (e.g from many sources, of various forms, at different rates, etc.). These factors impede the practices of not only processing data, but also analyzing and displaying it in an efficient manner to the user. Many efforts have been completed in the data mining and visual analytics community to create effective ways to further improve analysis and achieve the knowledge desired for better understanding. Our approach for improved big data visual analytics is two-fold, focusing on both visualization and interaction. Given geo-tagged information, we are exploring the benefits of visualizing datasets in the original geospatial domain by utilizing a virtual reality platform. After running proven analytics on the data, we intend to represent the information in a more realistic 3D setting, where analysts can achieve an enhanced situational awareness and rely on familiar perceptions to draw in-depth conclusions on the dataset. In addition, developing a human-computer interface that responds to natural user actions and inputs creates a more intuitive environment. Tasks can be performed to manipulate the dataset and allow users to dive deeper upon request, adhering to desired demands and intentions.

1501.03383,cs,"It has become apparent that a Gaussian center bias can serve as an important prior for visual saliency detection, which has been demonstrated for predicting human eye fixations and salient object detection. Tseng et al. have shown that the photographer's tendency to place interesting objects in the center is a likely cause for the center bias of eye fixations. We investigate the influence of the photographer's center bias on salient object detection, extending our previous work. We show that the centroid locations of salient objects in photographs of Achanta and Liu's data set in fact correlate strongly with a Gaussian model. This is an important insight, because it provides an empirical motivation and justification for the integration of such a center bias in salient object detection algorithms and helps to understand why Gaussian models are so effective. To assess the influence of the center bias on salient object detection, we integrate an explicit Gaussian center bias model into two state-of-the-art salient object detection algorithms. This way, first, we quantify the influence of the Gaussian center bias on pixel- and segment-based salient object detection. Second, we improve the performance in terms of F1 score, Fb score, area under the recall-precision curve, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and hit-rate on the well-known data set by Achanta and Liu. Third, by debiasing Cheng et al.'s region contrast model, we exemplarily demonstrate that implicit center biases are partially responsible for the outstanding performance of state-of-the-art algorithms. Last but not least, as a result of debiasing Cheng et al.'s algorithm, we introduce a non-biased salient object detection method, which is of interest for applications in which the image data is not likely to have a photographer's center bias (e.g., image data of surveillance cameras or autonomous robots).",15,[],7
1502.02370,cs,"Teachable Agent (TA) is a special type of pedagogical agent which instantiates the educational theory of Learning by Teaching. Soon after its emergence, research of TA becomes an active field, as it can solve the over scaffolded problem in traditional pedagogical systems, and encourage students to take the responsibility of learning. Apart from the benefits, existing TA design also has limitations. One is the lack of enough proactive interactions with students during the learning process, and the other is the lack of believability to arouse students empathy so as to offer students an immersive learning experience. To solve these two problems, we propose a new type of TA, Affective Teachable Agent, and use a goal oriented approach to design and implement the agent system allowing agents to proactively interact with students with affective expressions. The ATA model begins with the analysis of pedagogical requirements and teaching goals, using Learning by Teaching theory to design interventions which can authentically promote the learning behaviors of students. Two crucial capabilities of ATA are highlighted Teachability, to learn new knowledge and apply the knowledge to certain tasks, and Affectivability, to establish good relationship with students and encourage them to teach well. Through executing a hierarchy of goals, the proposed TA can interact with students by pursuing its own agenda. When a student teaches the agent, the agent is performed as a naive learning companion, and when an educator teaches the agent during the design and maintenance time, the agent can perform as an authoring tool. To facilitate the involvement of educators into the game design, we develop an authoring tool for proposed ATA system, which can encapsulate the technical details and provide educational experts a natural way to convey domain knowledge to agent knowledge base.",15,[],7

By means of a longitudinal empirical study of 18 large open-source projects, we examine and discuss the evolutionary principles that govern the coordination of developers.

In particular, we found that: (a) developers form scale-free networks, in which the majority of coordination requirements arise among an extremely small number of developers, (b) developers tend to accumulate coordination requirements with more and more developers over time, presumably limited by an upper bound, and (c) initially developers are hierarchically arranged, but over time, form a hybrid structure, in which core developers are hierarchically arranged and peripheral developers are not.

The CP problem is NP-Hard, hence we design a unique push-based heuristic, called Weighted Social Network Analysis (W-SNA) for CCDN providers. W-SNA is based on Betweeness Centrality (BC) from SNA and prioritizes surrogates based on their relationship to the other vertices in the network graph. To achieve our unique objectives, we further prioritize surrogates based on weights derived from storage cost and content requests. We compare our heuristic to current state of the art Greedy Site (GS) and purely Social Network Analysis (SNA) heuristics, which are relevant to our work. We show that W-SNA outperforms GS and SNA in minimizing cost and QoS. Moreover, W-SNA guarantees SLA but also minimizes the degree of QoS violations.

In particular, the running time is upper-bounded by equation where equation is the complexity of equation and equation and equation is the maximal ratio of the lengths of any pair of segments from equation and equation. The Fr\'echet distance captures the minimal cost of a continuous deformation of equation into equation and vice versa and defines the cost of a deformation as the maximal distance between two points that are related. The integral Fr\'echet distance defines the cost of a deformation as the integral of the distances between points that are related. The average Fr\'echet distance is defined as the integral Fr\'echet distance divided by the lengths of equation and equation.   Furthermore, we give relations between weighted shortest paths inside a single parameter cell equation and the monotone free space axis of equation. As a result we present a simple construction of weighted shortest paths inside a parameter cell.

Input to the fuzzy step is the total load per phase of the feeders. Output of the fuzzy step is the load change values, negative value for load releasing and positive value for load receiving. The output of the fuzzy step is the input to the load changing system. The load changing system uses combinatorial optimization techniques to translate the change values (kW) into number of load points and then selects the specific load points.

1510.03637,cs,"Choreographic Programming is a correct-by-construction paradigm for distributed programming, where global declarative descriptions of communications (choreographies) are used to synthesise deadlock-free processes. Choreographies are global descriptions of communications in concurrent systems, which have been used in different methodologies for the verification or synthesis of programs. However, there is no formalisation that provides a chain of correctness from choreographies to their implementations. This problem originates from the gap between previous theoretical models, which abstract communications using channel names (\`a la CCS/equation-calculus), and their implementations, which use low-level mechanisms for message routing. As a solution, we propose the framework of Applied Choreographies (AC). In AC, programmers write choreographies in a language that follows the standard syntax and semantics of previous works. Then, choreographies are compiled to a real-world execution model for Service-Oriented Computing (SOC). To manage the complexity of this task, our compilation happens in three steps, respectively dealing with: implementing name-based communications using the concrete mechanism found in SOC, projecting a choreography to a set of processes, and translating processes to a distributed implementation in terms of services. For each step a suitable correspondence result guarantees that the behaviour is preserved, thus ensuring the correctness of the global compilation process.

Domain adaptation algorithms aim to ameliorate domain shift, allowing a model trained on a source to perform well on a different target domain. However, even for the setting of unsupervised domain adaptation, where the target domain is unlabelled, collecting data for every possible target domain is still costly. In this paper, we propose a new domain adaptation method that has no need to access either data or labels of the target domain when it can be described by a parametrised vector and there exits several related source domains within the same parametric space.

OCM then allows threads to run in parallel, so long as results remain consistent with the cooperative model.   Programmers benefit because they can reason largely sequentially. Remaining interthread interactions are far less chaotic than in other models, permitting easier reasoning and debugging. Programmers can also defer the choice of concurrency-control mechanism (e.g., locks or transactions) until after they have written their programs, at which point they can compare concurrency-control strategies and choose the one that offers the best performance.

Also, a key result employed in the bivalued case by Feinerman et al. is an estimate of the probability of observing the most frequent opinion from observing the mode of a small sample. We generalize this result to the multivalued case by providing a new analytical proof for the bivalued case that is amenable to be extended, by induction, and that is of independent interest.",15,[],7
1510.01625,cs,"In this paper we present a new approach for dynamic motion planning for legged robots. We formulate a trajectory optimization problem based on a compact form of the robot dynamics. Such a form is obtained by projecting the rigid body dynamics onto the null space of the Constraint Jacobian. As consequence of the projection, contact forces are removed from the model but their effects are still taken into account. This approach permits to solve the optimal control problem of a floating base constrained multibody system while avoiding the use of an explicit contact model. We use direct transcription to numerically solve the optimization. As the contact forces are not part of the decision variables the size of the resultant discrete mathematical program is reduced and therefore solutions can be obtained in a tractable time. Using a predefined sequence of contact configurations (phases), our approach solves motions where contact switches occur. Transitions between phases are automatically resolved without using a model for switching dynamics. We present results on a hydraulic quadruped robot (HyQ), including single phase (standing, crouching) as well as multiple phase (rearing, diagonal leg balancing and stepping) dynamic motions.",15,[],7
1505.07427,cs,"We present a robust and real-time monocular six degree of freedom relocalization system. Our system trains a convolutional neural network to regress the 6-DOF camera pose from a single RGB image in an end-to-end manner with no need of additional engineering or graph optimisation. The algorithm can operate indoors and outdoors in real time, taking 5ms per frame to compute. It obtains approximately 2m and 6 degree accuracy for large scale outdoor scenes and 0.5m and 10 degree accuracy indoors. This is achieved using an efficient 23 layer deep convnet, demonstrating that convnets can be used to solve complicated out of image plane regression problems. This was made possible by leveraging transfer learning from large scale classification data. We show the convnet localizes from high level features and is robust to difficult lighting, motion blur and different camera intrinsics where point based SIFT registration fails. Furthermore we show how the pose feature that is produced generalizes to other scenes allowing us to regress pose with only a few dozen training examples.

These architectures extract & learn the real world hierarchical visual features utilizing supervised & unsupervised learning approaches respectively. Both the approaches yet cannot scale up realistically to provide recognition for a very large number of objects as high as 10K. We propose a two level hierarchical deep learning architecture inspired by divide & conquer principle that decomposes the large scale recognition architecture into root & leaf level model architectures. Each of the root & leaf level models is trained exclusively to provide superior results than possible by any 1-level deep learning architecture prevalent today. The proposed architecture classifies objects in two steps. In the first step the root level model classifies the object in a high level category. In the second step, the leaf level recognition model for the recognized high level category is selected among all the leaf models. This leaf level model is presented with the same input object image which classifies it in a specific category. Also we propose a blend of leaf level models trained with either supervised or unsupervised learning approaches. Unsupervised learning is suitable whenever labelled data is scarce for the specific leaf level models. Currently the training of leaf level models is in progress; where we have trained 25 out of the total 47 leaf level models as of now.

We remark that the considered case is more general than the directed analog of the special case of the symmetric traveling salesman problem for which there were recent improvements on Christofides' algorithm.   The main idea of our approach is to first consider an easier problem obtained by significantly relaxing the general connectivity requirements into local connectivity conditions. For this relaxed problem, it is quite easy to give an algorithm with a guarantee of 3 on node-weighted shortest path metrics. More surprisingly, we then show that any algorithm (irrespective of the metric) for the relaxed problem can be turned into an algorithm for the asymmetric traveling salesman problem by only losing a small constant factor in the performance guarantee. This leaves open the intriguing task of designing a ""good"" algorithm for the relaxed problem on general metrics.",15,[],7

The input image is transposed and converted into an HSI color space. The I-plane is divided into four sub-images of equal size, rotating each sub-image with a different angle using a secret key. The secret information is divided into four blocks, which are then encrypted using an MLE algorithm (MLEA).

In these research fields, k-anonymity has been widely studied as an anonymity notion for mainly deterministic anonymization algorithms, and some probabilistic relaxations have been developed. However, they are not sufficient due to their limitations, i.e., being weaker than the original k-anonymity or requiring strong parametric assumptions. First we propose Pk-anonymity, a new probabilistic k-anonymity, and prove that Pk-anonymity is a mathematical extension of k-anonymity rather than a relaxation. Furthermore, Pk-anonymity requires no parametric assumptions. This property has a significant meaning in the viewpoint that it enables us to compare privacy levels of probabilistic microdata release algorithms with deterministic ones. Second, we apply Pk-anonymity to the post randomization method (PRAM), which is an SDC algorithm based on randomization. PRAM is proven to satisfy Pk-anonymity in a controlled way, i.e, one can control PRAM's parameter so that Pk-anonymity is satisfied.

We consider a Lagrangian for scalar field in curved space-time with nonlinearity equation, which along with the quadratic term equation (where equation is the interaction constant and equation is scalar curvature) contains a term equation linear in equation. Due to this term the condition for the extrema of the potential energy of scalar field is given by a cubic equation. Provided equation the scalar curvature equation (where equation and equation are Einstein's gravitational and cosmological constants) decreases along with decreasing equation in the process of the Universe's expansion, and at some critical value equation a first-order phase transition occurs, induced by an ""external field"" parameter proportional to equation. Given certain conditions the critical radius of the early Universe at the point of the first-order phase transition may reach arbitrary large values, so this scenario of unrestricted ""inflation"" of the Universe may be called ""hyperinflation"".

1509.00862,gr-qc,"Gravitational-wave data is gauge dependent. While we can restrict the class of gauges in which such data may be expressed, there will still be an infinite-dimensional group of transformations allowed while remaining in this class, and almost as many different---though physically equivalent---waveforms as there are transformations. This paper presents a method for calculating the effects of the most important transformation group, the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group, consisting of rotations, boosts, and supertranslations (which include time and space translations as special cases). To a reasonable approximation, these transformations result in simple coupling between the modes in a spin-weighted spherical-harmonic decomposition of the waveform. It is shown that waveforms from simulated compact binaries in the publicly available SXS waveform catalog contain unmodeled effects due to displacement and drift of the center of mass, accounting for mode-mixing at typical levels of 1%. However, these effects can be mitigated by measuring the average motion of the system's center of mass for a portion of the inspiral, and applying the opposite transformation to the waveform data. More generally, controlling the BMS transformations will be necessary to eliminate the gauge ambiguity inherent in gravitational-wave data for both numerical and analytical waveforms. Open-source code implementing BMS transformations of waveforms is included along with this paper in the supplemental materials.",15,[],13

These parameters in addition with the electric charge, cause different features in compare with the charged solution with constant-curvature horizon. For this class of asymptotically (A)dS solutions, the electric charge dominates the behavior of the metric as r goes to zero, and thus the central singularity is always timelike.

Furthermore, any description of perturbed motion can be altered by a gauge transformation. In this paper, I clarify the relationship between two treatments of perturbed motion and the gauge freedom in each. I first show explicitly how one common treatment, called the Gralla-Wald approximation, can be derived from a second, called the self-consistent approximation. I next present a general treatment of smooth gauge transformations in both approximations, in which I emphasise that the approximations' governing equations can be formulated in an invariant manner. All of these analyses are carried through second perturbative order, but the methods are general enough to go to any order.

Differently from other approaches, we provide two examples of elementary particle models that do not require extremely tiny coupling constants. We find the compatibility of the theoretical predictions with the IceCube results when the astrophysical flux has a cutoff of the order of 100 TeV (broken power law). In this case the most energetic part of the spectrum (PeV neutrinos) is due to an extra component such as the decay of a very massive dark matter component. Due to the low statistics at our disposal we have considered for simplicity the equivalence between deposited and neutrino energy, however such approximation does not affect dramatically the qualitative results. Of course, a purely astrophysical origin of the neutrino flux (no cutoff in energy below the PeV scale - unbroken power law) is still allowed.

1506.07151,hep-ph,"The realization in the early 1980s that weak scale supersymmetry stabilizes the Higgs sector of the spectacularly successful Standard Model led several authors to explore whether low energy supersymmetry could play a role in particle physics.

Supergravity models continue to be explored as one of the most promising extensions of the Standard Model. After a quick overview of some of the issues and aspirations of early researchers working to bring supersymmetry into the mainstream of particle physics, we re-examine early arguments that seemed to imply that superpartners would be revealed in experiments at LEP2 or at the Tevatron. Our purpose is to assess whether the absence of any superpartners in searches at LHC8 presents a crisis for supersymmetry. Toward this end, we re-evaluate fine-tuning arguments that lead to upper bounds on (some) superpartner masses. We conclude that phenomenologically viable superpartner spectra that could arise within a high scale model tuned no worse than a few percent are perfectly possible. While no viable underlying model of particle physics that leads to such spectra has yet emerged, we show that the (supergravity-based) Radiatively-driven Natural Supersymmetry (RNS) framework serves as a surrogate for a phenomenological analysis of an underlying theory with modest fine-tuning. We outline the phenomenological implications of this framework, with emphasis on those LHC and electron-positron collider signatures that might point to the underlying natural origin of gauge and Higgs boson masses.

1501.04915,hep-ph,"A contribution to equation hadroproduction is analyzed in which the meson production is mediated by three-gluon partonic state, with two gluons coming from the target and one gluon from the projectile. This mechanism involves double gluon density in one of the protons, hence this contribution enters at a non-leading twist. It is, however, relevant due to an enhancement factor coming from large double gluon density at small~equation. We calculate the three-gluon contribution to equation hadroproduction within perturbative QCD in the equation-factorization framework. Results are obtained for differential equation-dependent cross-sections for all equation polarizations and for the sum over the polarization components. The rescattering contribution is found to provide a significant correction to the standard leading twist cross-section at the energies of the Tevatron or the LHC at moderate equation. We suggest equation production in proton-nucleus collision as a possible probe of the triple gluon mechanism.",15,[],2

The extended Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, due to the mixing among the vector-like quark and the standard model quarks, provides additional sources of the CP violation. Together with the enhancement from large vector-like quark mass, a large enough baryon-to-photon ratio could be obtained. The strongly first-order phase transition could be realized via the potential barrier which separate the broken minimum and the symmetric minimum in the scalar potential. We investigate in detail the one-loop temperature-dependent effective potential, and perform a random parameter scan to study the allowed parameter region that satisfies the strongly first order phase transition criteria equation. Several distinct patterns of phase transition are classified and discussed. Among these patterns, large trilinear mass term between the Higgs boson and the scalar is preferred, for it controls the width of the potential barrier. Our results indicate large quartic scalar couplings, and moderate mixing angle between the Higgs boson and the new scalar. This parameter region could be further explored at the Run 2 LHC.",15,[],2

A broad selection of UV boundary conditions are formulated corresponding to differing AS scenarios, and we find an AS scenario with very strong predictive power, allowing unique determination of most of the parameters in the model.

Our analysis is in good agreement with equation annihilation data. We also impose the finite-mass effects of proton in our calculations, a topic with a very little attention paid to in the literatures. Proton mass effects turn out to be appreciable for the gluon and light quark fragmentation functions, so the inclusion of finite-mass effects tends to improve the overall description of the data by reducing the minimized equation values, significantly.

We present a fully flavour-covariant formalism for transport phenomena, in order to consistently capture all flavour effects in the system. We explicitly study the scenario of Resonant Leptogenesis (RL), and show that flavour covariance requires one to consider generically off-diagonal number densities, rank-4 rate tensors in flavour space, and non-trivial generalization of the discrete symmetries C, P and T. The flavour-covariant transport equations, obtained in our semi-classical framework, describe the effects of three relevant physical phenomena: coherent heavy-neutrino oscillations, quantum decoherence in the charged-lepton sector, and resonant CP violation due to heavy-neutrino mixing. We show quantitatively that the final asymmetry is enhanced by up to an order of magnitude, for electroweak-scale heavy neutrinos, as compared to that obtained from flavour-diagonal or partially flavour off-diagonal equations. A full field-theoretic treatment in the weakly-resonant regime, based on the Kadanoff-Baym (KB) equations, confirms that heavy-neutrino oscillations and mixing are two distinct phenomena, and reproduces the results obtained in our semi-classical framework. Finally, we show that the quasi-particle ansaetze, often employed in KB approaches to RL, discard the phenomenon of mixing, capturing only oscillations and leading to an underestimate of the final asymmetry by a factor of order 2.",15,[],2

We review the theoretical structure and analyze the phenomenological implications of this particular realization of the alignment limit, where decoupling of the extra states cannot occur given that the lighter CP-even state equation must, by definition, have a mass below 125 GeV. For the numerical analysis, we perform scans of the 2HDM parameter space employing the software packages 2HDMC and Lilith, taking into account all relevant pre-LHC constraints, constraints from the measurements of the 125 GeV Higgs signal at the LHC, as well as the most recent limits coming from searches for heavy Higgs-like states.

1506.03360,hep-ph,"The scale of neutrino masses and the Planck scale are separated by more than twenty-seven order of magnitudes. However, they can be linked by imposing the stability of the electroweak (EW) vacuum. The crucial ingredient is provided by the generation of neutrino masses via a seesaw mechanism triggered by Yukawa interactions between the standard model (SM) Higgs and lepton doublets and additional heavy right-handed neutrinos. These neutrinos participate to the renormalization group (RG) running of the dimensionless SM couplings, affecting their high-energy behavior. The Higgs quartic coupling is dragged towards negative values, thus altering the stability of the EW vacuum. In the usual type-I seesaw model, this effect is too small to be a threat since, in order to comply with low-energy neutrino data, one is forced to consider either too small Yukawa couplings or too heavy right-handed neutrinos. In this paper we explore this general idea in the context of low-scale seesaw models. These models are characterized by sizable Yukawa couplings and right-handed neutrinos with mass of the order of the EW scale, thus maximizing their impact on the RG flow. As a general result, we find that Yukawa couplings such that equation are excluded. We discuss the impact of this bound on several observables, with a special focus on the lepton flavor violating process equation and the neutrino-less double beta decay.",15,[],2

Another novel result is that at high pressure and low temperature we observe a first order transition which presents a negative slope in the equation that is reminiscent of the solid-liquid transition line observed within the water phase diagram.

At these thresholds, the effective theories are matched. When calculating the two-loop RG running, the matching has to be performed at the one-loop level.

The solution that we proposed in 2013 to solve the equation anomaly, with a contribution equation, is confirmed and reinforced. A wider range of New-Physics scenarios with high significances (between 4 and 5 equation) emerges from the fit, some of them being particularly relevant for model building. More data is needed to discriminate among them conclusively.

CPT-violating see-saw involves a sterile partner of the neutron, living in a hidden sector, in which CPT is spontaneously broken. In particular, neutrons (antineutrons) can communicate with the hidden sector through non-perturbative quantum gravity effects called \it exotic instantons. Exotic instantons dynamically break R-parity, generating one effective vertex between the neutron and its sterile partner. In this way, we show how a small CPT violating mass term for the neutron is naturally generated. This model can be tested in the next generation of experiments in neutron-antineutron physics. This strongly motivates researches of CPT-violating effects in neutron-antineutron physics, as a test-bed for dynamical CPT-violations in SM.",15,[],2

A modified dark sector can also change the phenomenology greatly. The addition of the QCD axion to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) solves the strong CP problem and also modifies the dark sector with new dark matter candidates. While SUSY axion phenomenology is usually restricted to searches for the axion itself or searches for the ordinary SUSY particles, this work focuses on scenarios where the axion's superpartner, the axino may be detectable at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in the decays of neutralinos displaced from the primary vertex. In particular this work focuses on the KSVZ axino. The decay length of neutralinos in this scenario easily fits the ATLAS detector for SUSY spectra expected to be testable at the 14 TeV LHC. This signature of displaced decays to axinos is compared to other well motivated scenarios containing a long lived neutralino which decays inside the detector. These alternative scenarios can in some cases very closely mimic the expected axino signature, and the degree to which they are distinguishable is discussed.

1503.06210,hep-th,"We elucidate aspects of the one-loop anomalous dimension of equation-singlet multi-trace operators in equation SYM at finite equation. First, we study how equation corrections lift the large equation degeneracy of the spectrum, which we call the operator submixing problem. We observe that all large equation zero modes acquire non-positive anomalous dimension starting at order equation, and they mix only among the operators with the same number of traces at leading order. Second, we study the lowest one-loop dimension of operators of length equal to equation. The dimension of such operators becomes more negative as equation increases, which will eventually diverge in a double scaling limit. Third, we examine the structure of level-crossing at finite equation in view of unitarity. Finally we find out a correspondence between the large equation zero modes and completely symmetric polynomials of Mandelstam variables.",15,[],4
1503.03080,hep-th,"The pure spinor formalism for the superstring was recently obtained by gauge-fixing a purely bosonic classical action involving a twistor-like constraint equation where equation is a d=10 pure spinor. This twistor-like constraint replaces the usual Virasoro constraint equation, and the Green-Schwarz fermionic spacetime spinor variables equation arise as Faddeev-Popov ghosts for this constraint.   In this paper, the purely bosonic classical action is simplified by replacing the classical d=10 pure spinor equation with a d=10 projective pure spinor. The pure spinor and Green-Schwarz formalisms for the superparticle and superstring are then obtained as different gauge-fixings of this purely bosonic classical action, and the Green-Schwarz kappa symmetry is directly related to the pure spinor BRST symmetry. Since a d=10 projective pure spinor parameterizes equation, this action can be interpreted as a standard equation topological action where one integrates over the equation choice of complex structure. Finally, a purely bosonic action for the d=11 supermembrane is proposed which reduces upon double-dimensional reduction to the purely bosonic action for the d=10 Type IIA superstring.",15,[],4
1507.00779,hep-th,"In this work, we first introduce a generalized von Neumann entropy that depends only on the density matrix. This is based on a previous proposal by one of us modifying the Shannon entropy by considering non-equilibrium systems on stationary states, and an entropy functional depending only on the probability. We propose a generalization of the replica trick and find that the resulting modified von Neumann entropy is precisely the previous mentioned entropy that was obtained by other assumptions. Then, we address the question whether alternative entanglement entropies can play a role in the gauge/gravity duality. Our focus are 2d CFT and their gravity duals. Our results show corrections to the von Neumann entropy equation that are larger than the usual equation ones and also than the corrections to the length dependent equation entropy which result comparable to the equation ones. The correction terms due to the new entropy would modify the Ryu-Takayanagi identification between the CFT and the gravitational equation entropies.",15,[],4

This gauge theory problem corresponds, in the dual gravity description, to an initial value problem in Einstein-Maxwell theory with homogeneous but anisotropic initial conditions. We explore the dependence of the equilibration process on different aspects of the initial departure from equilibrium and, while controlling for these dependencies, examine how the equilibration dynamics are affected by the presence of a non-vanishing charge density or an external magnetic field. The equilibration dynamics are remarkably insensitive to the addition of even large chemical potentials or magnetic fields; the equilibration time is set primarily by the form of the initial departure from equilibrium. For initial deviations from equilibrium which are well localized in scale, we formulate a simple model for equilibration times which agrees quite well with our results.",15,[],4

Using this strategy we give a simple example of constructing exact circular solutions in three dimensional gravities, these solutions contain the HMTZ black holes as a special case and some other new solutions.

By working in the Hamiltonian formalism and starting from an equivalent description of the model as a two-parameter deformation of the coset sigma-model on G x G / Gdiag, we show that it also admits a Lax matrix whose Poisson bracket is of the standard r/s-form characterised by a twist function which we determine. A number of results immediately follow from this, including the identification of certain complex Poisson commuting Kac-Moody currents as well as an explicit description of the q-deformed symmetries of the model. Moreover, the model is also shown to fit naturally in the general scheme recently developed for constructing integrable deformations of sigma-models.

It turns out that there exists an appropriate presymplectic form which vanishes on-shell. This promotes this set of metrics to a phase space in which the Brown-Henneaux asymptotic symmetries become symplectic symmetries in the bulk of spacetime. Moreover, any element in the phase space admits two global Killing vectors. We show that the conserved charges associated with these Killing vectors commute with the Virasoro symplectic symmetry algebra, extending the Virasoro symmetry algebra with two equation generators. We discuss that any element in the phase space falls into the coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro algebras and that each orbit is labeled by the equation Killing charges. Upon setting the right-moving function to zero and restricting the choice of orbits, one can take a near-horizon decoupling limit which preserves a chiral half of the symplectic symmetries.

We also proposed analogous formulae for other theories including maximal super-Yang-Mills theory and supergravity in other dimensions at one loop. We give further details of these results and extend them in two directions. Firstly, we propose new formulae for the one-loop integrands of Yang-Mills theory and gravity in the absence of supersymmetry. These follow from the identification of the states running in the loop as expressed in the ambitwistor-string correlator. Secondly, we give a systematic proof of the non-supersymmetric formulae using the worldsheet factorisation properties of the nodal Riemann sphere underlying the scattering equations at one loop.

The new ansaetze provide a substantially simpler method for uplifting d=4 flows compared to the previously available method using the 3-form and 6-form potential ansaetze. The ansatz for the Freund-Rubin term allows us to conjecture a `master formula' for the latter in terms of the scalar potential of d=4 gauged supergravity and its first derivative.

Our equation is the notion of (coarse-grained) CFT entropy outside the black hole given by causal holographic information -- a quantity in turn defined in the AdSequation dual by the renormalized area equation of a corresponding bulk causal horizon. A corollary is that the fine-grained GSL must hold for finite processes taken as a whole, though local decreases of the fine-grained generalized entropy are not obviously forbidden.

For closed strings, we demonstrate that the string partition function is not quite the same as the sum over the partition functions of the fields in the spectrum: an infinite overcounting is present for the latter. Next we study the partition functions obtained by excluding the surface terms. Using recent results of JHEP 1505 (2015) 106, this construction, first done by Emparan, can be put on much firmer ground.

All of these exhibit an IR divergence that can be interpreted as a maximal acceleration close to the black hole horizon. Ultimately, since these partition functions are only part of the full story, divergences here should not be viewed as a failure of string theory: maximal acceleration is a feature of a faulty treatment of the higher spin fields in the string spectrum.

1509.07153,hep-th,"This thesis deals with Double Field Theory (DFT), an effective field theory capturing the low energy dynamics of closed strings on a torus. It renders T-duality on a torus manifest by adding equation winding coordinates in addition to the equation space time coordinates. An essential consistency constraint of the theory, the strong constraint, only allows for field configurations which depend on half of the coordinates of the arising doubled space. I derive DFTequation, a generalization of the current formalism. It captures the low energy dynamics of a closed bosonic string propagating on a compact group manifold. Its classical action and the corresponding gauge transformations arise from Closed String Field Theory up to cubic order in the massless fields. These results are rewritten in terms of a generalized metric and extended to all orders in the fields. There is an explicit distinction between background and fluctuations. For the gauge algebra to close, the latter have to fulfill a modified strong constraint, while for the former the weaker closure constraint is sufficient. Besides the generalized diffeomorphism invariance known from the original formulation, DFTequation is invariant under standard diffeomorphisms of the doubled space. They are broken by imposing the totally optional extended strong constraint. In doing so, the original formulation is restored. A flux formulation for the new theory is derived and its connection to generalized Scherk-Schwarz compactifications is discussed. Further, a possible tree-level uplift of a genuinely non-geometric background (not T-dual to any geometric configuration) is presented. Finally, a long standing problem, the missing of a prescription to construct the twist in generalized Scherk-Schwarz compactifications, is solved. Altogether, a more general picture of DFT and the structures it is based on emerges.",15,[],4

Using string theory and standard model data, we find that the corresponding axion window is in the allowed range equation matching with the recent cosmological results.

A powerful constraint comes from dual superconformal invariance, in the form of a equation differential equation, which heavily constrains the first derivatives of the transcendental functions entering the ratio function. At four loops, it leaves only a 34-parameter space of functions. Constraints from the collinear limits, and from the multi-Regge limit at the leading-logarithmic (LL) and next-to-leading-logarithmic (NLL) order, suffice to fix these parameters and obtain a unique result.

Such states are described by domain wall geometries that interpolate between equation spaces with different light velocities, and for a given equation, they exist below a critical value of the coupling.

The pairs (letter,U$, for letter varying in moduli space, allow us to define natural holomorphic coordinates on the moduli space of convex RP2 structures.

The fluids are acted on by gravity in the bulk, and at the free interfaces we consider both the case of surface tension and the case of no surface forces. We establish a sharp nonlinear global-in-time stability criterion and give the explicit decay rates to the equilibrium. When the upper fluid is heavier than the lower fluid along the equilibrium interface, we characterize the set of surface tension values in which the equilibrium is nonlinearly stable. Remarkably, this set is non-empty, i.e. sufficiently large surface tension can prevent the onset of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.

The core contribution of this paper is to provide a simple argument circumventing this difficulty.   In the case where the map is constructed from a chain of subalgebras we prove that the image is given by a list of inequalities that can be computed explicitly.

1504.04981,math,"Roughly speaking, the regular subspace of a Dirichlet form is also a regular Dirichlet form on the same state space. It inherits the same form of original Dirichlet form but possesses a smaller domain. What we are concerned in this paper are the regular subspaces of associated Dirichlet forms of skew product diffusions. A skew product diffusion equation is a symmetric Markov process on the product state space equation and expressed as \[ Xt=(X1t,X2At),\quad t\geq 0, \] where equation is a symmetric diffusion on equation for equation, and equation is a positive continuous additive functional of equation. One of our main results indicates that any skew product type regular subspace of equation, say \[ Yt=(Y1t,Y2\tildeAt),\quad t\geq 0, \] can be characterized as follows: the associated smooth measure of equation is equal to that of equation, and equation corresponds to a regular subspace of equation for equation. Furthermore, we shall make some discussions on rotationally invariant diffusions on equation, which are special skew product diffusions on equation. Our main purpose is to extend a regular subspace of rotationally invariant diffusion on equation to a new regular Dirichlet form on equation.",15,[],0

1507.05332,math,"In 1984, Kelly and Oxley introduced the model of a random representable matroid equation corresponding to a random matrix equation, whose entries are drawn independently and uniformly from equation. Whereas properties such as rank, connectivity, and circuit size have been well-studied, forbidden minors have not yet been analyzed. Here, we investigate the asymptotic probability as equation that a fixed equation-representable matroid equation is a minor of equation. (We always assume equation for all sufficiently large equation, otherwise equation can never be a minor of the corresponding equation.) When equation is free, we show that equation is asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s.) a minor of equation. When equation is not free, we show a phase transition: equation is a.a.s. a minor if equation, but is a.a.s. not if equation. In the more general settings of equation and equation, we give lower and upper bounds, respectively, on both the asymptotic and non-asymptotic probability that equation is a minor of equation. The tools we develop to analyze matroid operations and minors of random matroids may be of independent interest.   Our results directly imply that equation is a.a.s. not contained in any proper, minor-closed class equation of equation-representable matroids, provided: (i) equation, and (ii) equation is at least the minimum rank of any equation-representable forbidden minor of equation, for all sufficiently large equation.

In spite of the analogies with the Kuramoto setup, a much richer scenario is observed. The ""synchronised phase"", which emerges upon increasing the coupling strength, is characterized by highly-irregular fluctuations: a time-series analysis reveals that the dynamics of the order parameter is indeed high-dimensional. The complex dynamics appears to be the result of the non-perturbative action of a suitably shaped phase-response curve. Such mechanism differs from the often invoked balance between excitation and inhibition and might provide an alternative basis to account for the self-sustained brain activity in the resting state. The potential interest of this dynamical regime is further strengthened by its (microscopic) linear stability, which makes it quite suited for computational tasks. The overall study has been performed by combining analytical and numerical studies, starting from the linear stability analysis of the asynchronous regime, to include the Fourier analysis of the Kuramoto order parameter, the computation of various types of Lyapunov exponents, and a microscopic study of the inter-spike intervals.",15,[],9

Drawing on complexity theory directly, this paper builds on those accounts, further developing the constraint-based interpretation of emergence and arguing that such accounts recover many of the features of more traditional accounts. We show that the constraint-based account of emergence also leads naturally into a meaningful definition of self-organization, another concept that has received increasing attention recently.

1503.05212,nlin,"Three-dimensional excitable systems can create nonlinear scroll waves that rotate around one-dimensional phase singularities. Recent theoretical work predicts that these filaments drift along step-like height variations. Here we test this prediction using experiments with thin layers of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. We observe that over short distances scroll waves are attracted towards the step and then rapidly commence a steady drift along the step line. The translating filaments always reside in the shallow subsystem and terminate on the step plateau near the edge. Accordingly filaments in the deep subsystem initially collide with and shorten at the step wall. The drift speeds obey the predicted proportional dependence on the logarithm of the height ratio and the direction depends on the vortex chirality. We also observe drift along the perimeter of rectangular plateaus and find that the filaments perform sharp turns at the corners. In addition, we investigate rectangular troughs for which vortices of equal chirality can drift in different directions. The latter two effects are reproduced in numerical simulations with the Barkley model. The simulations show that narrow troughs instigate scroll wave encounters that induce repulsive interaction and symmetry breaking. Similar phenomena could exist in the geometrical complicated ventricles of the human heart where reentrant vortex waves cause tachycardia and fibrillation.",15,[],9

We obtain the stationary probability density and mean first passage time of the system. We show that increasing additive(multiplicative) noise intensity induces regime shift from a low(high) to a high(low) pro- tein concentration state. However, an increase in cross correlation intensity always induces regime shifts from high to low protein concentration state. For both bifurcation (often called tipping point) and noise induced (called stochastic switching) regime shifts, we further explore the robustness of recently developed critical slowing down based early warning signal (EWS) indicators (e.g., rising variance and lag-1 autocorrelation) on our simulated time series data. We identify that using EWS indicators, prediction of an impending bifurcation induced regime shift is relatively easier than that of a noise induced regime shift in the considered system. Moreover, the success of EWS indicators also strongly depends upon the nature of noise. Our results establish the key fact that finding more robust indicator to forewarn regime shifts for a broader class complex natural systems is still in its infancy and demands extensive research.",15,[],9
1512.08578,nlin,"In a recent study of chaos synchronization in symmetric complex networks [Pecora \textitet al., Nat. Commun. \bf 5, 4079 (2014)], it is found that stable synchronous clusters may coexist with many non-synchronous nodes in the asynchronous regime, resembling the chimera state observed in regular networks of non-locally coupled periodic oscillators. Although of practical significance, this new type of state, namely the chimera-synchronization state, is hardly generated for the general complex networks, due to either the topological instabilities or the weak coupling strength. Here, based on the strategy of pinning coupling, we propose an effective method for inducing chimera-synchronization in symmetric complex network of coupled chaotic oscillators. We are able to argue mathematically that, by pinning a group of nodes satisfying permutation symmetry, there always exits a critical pinning strength beyond which the unstable chimera-synchronization states can be successfully induced. The feasibility and efficiency of the control method are verified by numerical simulations of both artificial and real-world complex networks, with the numerical results well fitted by the theoretical predictions.",15,[],9

This rate describes how quickly a system produces new and random information, is fundamentally important in statistical mechanics and practically important for random number generation. We experimentally study entropy generation and the emergence of deterministic chaotic dynamics from discrete noise in a system that applies feedback to a weak optical signal at the single-photon level.

We use the improved version of the method by Kowalewski to prove two results. First, without using the Hamiltonian structure of the Clebsch system, we show that the integration of the equations of motion may be achieved by computing four Abelian integrals. Next, taking into account its Hamiltonian structure, we show that two quadratures are sufficient to compute a complete integral of its Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this way, the process of solution of the equations of motion of the Clebsch system is clarified both from the standpoint of Abel and from the standpoint of Jacobi.",15,[],9

1507.04381,nlin,"Synchronization is an important and prevalent phenomenon in natural and engineered systems. In many dynamical networks, the coupling is balanced or adjusted in order to admit global synchronization, a condition called Laplacian coupling. Many networks exhibit incomplete synchronization, where two or more clusters of synchronization persist, and computational group theory has recently proved to be valuable in discovering these cluster states based upon the topology of the network. In the important case of Laplacian coupling, additional synchronization patterns can exist that would not be predicted from the group theory analysis alone. The understanding of how and when clusters form, merge, and persist is essential for understanding collective dynamics, synchronization, and failure mechanisms of complex networks such as electric power grids, distributed control networks, and autonomous swarming vehicles. We describe here a method to find and analyze all of the possible cluster synchronization patterns in a Laplacian-coupled network, by applying methods of computational group theory to dynamically-equivalent networks.

Analytic results yield that if the repulsion parameter is small enough in comparison with the degree of the maximum hub, then the full synchronization state is locally stable. Numerical experiments are performed to explore the model beyond this threshold, where the overall cohesion is lost.

In spite of different nature of tunneling in the two systems, the I-NI transition exhibits very common characteristics. In particular, the manifestation of I-NI transition is obviously explained by a remarkable quenching of the renormalized transition matrix element.

If, however, in place of simple cells one uses agents which change their behaviour from one rule to another after a fixed number of iterations, the classification can be performed by the traffic rule 184 and the majority rule 232. This two-rule solution cannot be easily generalized to two (or higher) dimensions, because it critically depends on a kinetic phase transition occurring in the rule 184. No rule exhibiting analogous transition is known in two dimensions, most likely because no such rule exists. We propose, therefore, to approach this problem form a slightly different angle, namely by introducing a stochastic component into each of the two rules. If one precedes each iteration of rule 184 by the stochastic ""lane changing rule,"" and each iteration of rule 232 by the stochastic ""crowd avoidance"" rule, in the limit of infinitely many iterations the classification can be performed correctly with probability 1. This solution can be described either in the language of CA, or using the paradigm of agents which move and proliferate on the 2D lattice, following probabilistic rules.",15,[],9
1509.03828,nlin,"The dynamical behavior of a higher-order cubic Ginzburg-Landau equation is found to include a wide range of scenarios due to the interplay of higher-order physically relevant terms. We find that the competition between the third-order dispersion and stimulated Raman scattering effects, gives rise to rich dynamics: this extends from Poincar\'e-Bendixson--type scenarios, in the sense that bounded solutions may converge either to distinct equilibria via orbital connections, or space-time periodic solutions, to the emergence of almost periodic and chaotic behavior. One of our main results is that the third-order dispersion has a dominant role in the development of such complex dynamics, since it can be chiefly responsible (i.e., even in the absence of the other higher-order effects) for the existence of the periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic spatiotemporal structures. Suitable low-dimensional phase space diagnostics are devised and used to illustrate the different possibilities and identify their respective parametric intervals over multiple parameters of the model.",15,[],9

This provides us a uniform framework for the non subjective comparison of the statistical measures of the recurrence networks constructed from various chaotic attractors. We explicitly show that the degree distribution of the recurrence network constructed by our scheme is characteristic to the structure of the attractor and display statistical scale invariance with respect to increase in the number of nodes equation. We also present two practical applications of the scheme, detection of transition between two dynamical regimes in a time delayed system and identification of the dimensionality of the underlying system from real world data with limited number of points, through recurrence network measures.

1506.01389,nlin,"Solitons are very effective in transporting energy over great distances and collisions between them can produce high energy density spots of relevance to phase transformations, energy localization and defect formation among others. It is then important to study how energy density accumulation scales in multi-soliton collisions. In this study, we demonstrate that the maximal energy density that can be achieved in collision of equation slowly moving kinks and antikinks in the integrable sine-Gordon field, remarkably, is proportional to equation, while the total energy of the system is proportional to equation. This maximal energy density can be achieved only if the difference between the number of colliding kinks and antikinks is minimal, i.e., is equal to 0 for even equation and 1 for odd equation and if the pattern involves an alternating array of kinks and anti-kinks. Interestingly, for odd (even) equation the maximal energy density appears in the form of potential (kinetic) energy, while kinetic (potential) energy is equal to zero. The results of the present study rely on the analysis of the exact multi-soliton solutions for equation and 3 and on the numerical simulation results for equation and 7. Based on these results one can speculate that the soliton collisions in the sine-Gordon field can, in principle, controllably produce very high energy density.

In this paper we show that this results could be guessed in a simple way using a, to the best of our knowledge, novel integral geometry lemma. Such a lemma establishes that it is possible to express the integral of a fairly general and smooth function equation over a parabola of the equation plane in terms of the integrals of equation over all straight lines non intersecting the parabola. A similar result, in which the parabola is replaced by the circle, is already known in the literature and finds applications in tomography. Indeed, in a two-dimensional linear tomographic problem with a convex opaque obstacle, only the integrals along the straight lines non-intersecting the obstacle are known, and in the class of potentials equation with polynomial decay we do not have unique solvability of the inverse problem anymore. Therefore, for the problem with an obstacle, it is natural not to try to reconstruct the complete potential, but only some integral characteristics like the integral over the boundary of the obstacle. Due to the above two lemmas, this can be done, at the moment, for opaque bodies having as boundary a parabola and a circle (an ellipse).",15,[],9

Although, for many standard systems, coupling strengths need to be bounded to ensure synchrony, transient uncoupling removes this bound and thus enables synchronization in an infinite range of effective coupling strengths.

1505.03847,nlin,"The aim of this work is to review and also explore even further the escape properties of orbits in a dynamical system of a two-dimensional perturbed harmonic oscillator, which is a characteristic example of open Hamiltonian systems. In particular, we conduct a thorough numerical investigation distinguishing between trapped (ordered and chaotic) and escaping orbits, considering only unbounded motion for several energy levels. It is of particular interest, to locate the basins of escape towards the different escape channels and connect them with the corresponding escape periods of the orbits. We split our examination into three different cases depending on the function of the perturbation term which determines the number of escape channels on the physical space. In every case, we computed extensive samples of orbits in both the physical and the phase space by integrating numerically the equations of motion as well as the variational equations. In an attempt to determine the regular or chaotic nature of trapped motion, we applied the SALI method as a chaos detector. It was found, that in all studied cases regions of trapped orbits coexist with several basins of escape. It was also observed, that for energy levels very close to the escape value the escape times of orbits are large, while for values of energy much higher than the escape energy the vast majority of orbits escape very quickly or even immediately to infinity. The larger escape periods have been measured for orbits with initial conditions in the boundaries of the escape basins and also in the vicinity of the fractal structure. Most of the current outcomes have been compared with previous related work.

This system may be further reduced to a system of nonlinear algebraic equations for the parameters of the solved equation and parameters of the solution. Any nontrivial solution of the last system leads to a traveling wave solution of the solved nonlinear partial differential equation.

1511.08657,nlin,"Cellular automata (CA) have long attracted attention as dynamical systems with local updating rules and yet can exhibit, for certain rules, complex, long space and time correlated patterns. This contrast with other rules which results in trivial patterns being homogeneous or periodic. In this article we approach CA from two related angles: we analyze the information transfer in the time evolution of CA driven sequences and; we revisit the sensibility of the initial configuration on sequence evolution. In order to do so, we borrow a recently reported information distance based on Kolmogorov algorithmic complexity. The normalized information distance has been used previously to find a hierarchical clustering of CA rules. What is different in our approach, is the temporal analysis of the sequence evolutions by correlating different calculated distances with entropy density. Entropy rate, is a length invariant measure of the amount of irreducible randomness in a dynamical process. In order to perform our analysis, we incorporate to the practical calculation of the entropy rate and the distance measure, the use of Lempel-Ziv complexity. Lempel-Ziv complexity carries a number of practical advantages while avoiding the uncomputable nature of Kolmogorov randomness. The reduction of entropy density during time evolution can be related to energy dissipation through Landauer principle. Related to the last fact, is the computational capabilities of CA as information processing rules, were the performed analysis could be used to select CA rules amiable for simulating different physical process. The tools developed in this article for the analysis of the CA are easily extendible to the study of other one dimensional dynamical systems.",15,[],9

At critical memory length, a Hopf bifurcation leads to the formation of stable limit cycles. In a mixed population, agents with longer memories have an advantage, provided the system has a stable fixed point, and there is some asymmetry in the payoffs of the pure strategies.

The comparison with the exact solutions of realistic isovector-isoscalar pairing Hamiltonians shows that this ansatz for the ground state is able to describe with high precision the pairing correlation energies. It is also shown that, at variance with the majority of Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations, in the present formalism the isovector and isoscalar pairing correlations coexist for any pairing interactions. The competition between the isovector and isoscalar proton-neutron pairing correlations is studied for N=Z nuclei with the valence nucleons moving in the equation and equation shells and in the major shell above equationSn. We find that in these nuclei the isovector pairing prevail over the isoscalar pairing, especially for heavier nuclei. However, the isoscalar proton-neutron correlations are significant in all nuclei and they always coexist with the isovector pairing correlations.",15,[],11

In the expansion of the EoS around the saturation point additional spin polarization terms are taken into account. These terms, together with the standard symmetry term, are responsible for appearance of the equation-like clusters in the ground state configurations of the N=Z even-even nuclei. At the nuclear surface these clusters can be identified as alpha particles. A correction for the surface effects is introduced for atomic nuclei. Taking into account an additional interaction between clusters the binding energies and sizes of the considered nuclei are very accurately described.

We analyze isoscalar states, isovector states, and the dipole polarizability. We define a reference value for the polarizability, to remove a trivial dependence on the mass number. We compare our results with data and other calculations, with a focus on collective states, shell effects, and threshold transitions.   Our results support the presence of a strong isoscalar transition, with little or moderate E1 strength, as a universal feature of ordinary nuclei. In moderately neutron-rich Ni isotopes, namely 68Ni and neighboring isotopes, this transition is found bimodal due to couplings with surface neutrons. An adequate treatment of the continuum states appears essential for describing suprathreshold E1 strength, especially beyond 68Ni. Very exotic isotopes (N>50) are found highly polarizable, with practically all their E1 strength in the continuum. The dipole polarizability and the neutron skin thickness are influenced by shell structure in different ways, so they can appear anticorrelated. A comparison with existing results for lighter (Ca) and heavier (Sn) nuclei suggests that the so-called pygmy dipole strength is influenced strongly by shell effects and that, partly for that reason, its isospin structure depends on the mass region.",15,[],11

The energies equation and reduced transition probabilities equation of equation-states are calculated with the Skyrme forces SV-bas and SkMequation. The energies of two-quasiparticle configurations forming the SRPA basis are corrected by using the pairing blocking effect. This results in a systematic downshift of equation by 0.3-0.5 MeV and thus in a better agreement with the experiment, especially in Sm, Gd, Dy, Hf, and W regions. For other isotopic chains, a noticeable overestimation of equation and too weak collectivity of equation-states still persist. It is shown that domains of nuclei with a low and high equation -collectivity are related with the structure of the lowest 2-quasiparticle states and conservation of the Nilsson selection rules. The description of equation states with SV-bas and SkMequation is similar in light rare-earth nuclei but deviates in heavier nuclei. However SV-bas much better reproduces the quadrupole deformation and energy of the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance. The accuracy of SRPA is justified by comparison with exact RPA.

Relative to our FRDM(1992) mass table in \sc Atomic Data and Nuclear Data Tables [\bf 59 185 (1995)], the results are obtained in the same model, but with considerably improved treatment of deformation and fewer of the approximations that were necessary earlier, due to limitations in computer power. The more accurate execution of the model and the more extensive and more accurate experimental mass data base now available allows us to determine one additional macroscopic-model parameter, the density-symmetry coefficient equation, which was not varied in the previous calculation, but set to zero. Because we now realize that the FRDM is inaccurate for some highly deformed shapes occurring in fission, because some effects are derived in terms of perturbations around a sphere, we only adjust its macroscopic parameters to ground-state masses.

Results in equation-hypernuclei appear to be almost independent of the choice for the high-density part of the equation interaction. The location of the equation-hyperdriplines is also evaluated. Significant deviations from Iron-Nickel elements can be found for equation-hypernuclei with the largest binding energy per baryon.

Within the deformed density-dependent cluster model, the penetration probability and the assault frequency are calculated using the WKB penetration probability.

1512.09146,nucl-th,"Background: The quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA), within the framework of the nuclear density functional theory (DFT), has been a standard tool to access the collective excitations of the atomic nuclei. Recently, finite amplitude method (FAM) has been developed, in order to perform the QRPA calculations efficiently without any truncation on the two-quasiparticle model space. Purpose: We discuss the nuclear giant dipole resonance (GDR) in heavy rare-earth isotopes, for which the conventional matrix diagonalization of the QRPA is numerically demanding. A role of the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn (TRK) sum rule enhancement factor, connected to the isovector effective mass, is also investigated. Methods: The electric dipole photoabsorption cross section was calculated within a parallelized FAM-QRPA scheme. We employed the Skyrme energy density functional self-consistently in the DFT calculation for the ground states and FAM-QRPA calculation for the excitations. Results: The mean GDR frequency and width are mostly reproduced with the FAM-QRPA, when compared to experimental data, although some deficiency is observed with isotopes heavier than erbium. A role of the TRK enhancement factor in actual GDR strength is clearly shown: its increment leads to a shift of the GDR strength to higher-energy region, without a significant change in the transition amplitudes. Conclusions: The newly developed FAM-QRPA scheme shows a remarkable efficiency, which enables to perform systematic analysis of GDR for heavy rare-earth nuclei. Theoretical deficiency of photoabsorption cross section could not be improved by only adjusting the TRK enhancement factor, suggesting the necessity of beyond the self-consistent QRPA approach, and/or a more systematic optimization of the EDF parameters.",15,[],11

1512.02172,physics,"Dewetting of thin metal films is one of the most widespread method for functional plasmonic nanostructures fabrication. However, simple thermal-induced dewetting does not allow to control degree of nanostructures order without additional lithographic process steps. Here we propose a novel method for lithography-free and large-scale fabrication of plasmonic nanostructures via controllable femtosecond laser-induced dewetting. The method is based on femtosecond laser surface pattering of a thin film followed by a nanoscale hydrodynamical instability, which is found to be very controllable under specific irradiation conditions. We achieve control over degree of nanostructures order by changing laser irradiation parametrs and film thickness. This allowed us to exploit the method for the broad range of applications: resonant light absorbtion and scattering, sensing, and potential improving of thin-film solar cells.",15,[],5

1502.00704,physics,"X-ray scattering is a weak linear probe of matter. It is primarily sensitive to the position of electrons and their momentum distribution. Elastic X-ray scattering forms the basis of atomic structural determination while inelastic Compton scattering is often used as a spectroscopic probe of both single-particle excitations and collective modes. X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) are unique tools for studying matter on its natural time and length scales due to their bright and coherent ultrashort pulses. However, in the focus of an XFEL the assumption of a weak linear probe breaks down, and nonlinear light-matter interactions can become ubiquitous. The field can be sufficiently high that even non-resonant multiphoton interactions at hard X-rays wavelengths become relevant. Here we report the observation of one of the most fundamental nonlinear X-ray-matter interactions, the simultaneous Compton scattering of two identical photons producing a single photon at nearly twice the photon energy. We measure scattered photons with an energy near 18 keV generated from solid beryllium irradiated by 8.8-9.75 keV XFEL pulses. The intensity in the X-ray focus reaches up to 4x20 W/cm2, which corresponds to a peak electric field two orders of magnitude higher than the atomic unit of field-strength and within four orders of magnitude of the quantum electrodynamic critical field. The observed signal scales quadratically in intensity and is emitted into a non-dipolar pattern, consistent with the simultaneous two-photon scattering from free electrons. However, the energy of the generated photons shows an anomalously large redshift only present at high intensities. This indicates that the instantaneous high-intensity scattering effectively interacts with a different electron momentum distribution than linear Compton scattering, with implications for the study of atomic-scale structure and dynamics of matter",15,[],5
1511.02063,physics,"The excitation of precursor solitons ahead of a rapidly moving object in a fluid, a spectacular phenomenon in hydrodynamics that has often been observed ahead of moving ships, has surprisingly not been investigated in plasmas where the fluid model holds good for low frequency excitations such as ion acoustic waves. In this paper we report the first experimental observation of precursor solitons in a flowing dusty plasma. The nonlinear solitary dust acoustic waves (DAWs) are excited by a supersonic mass flow of the dust particles over an electrostatic potential hill. In a frame where the fluid is stationary and the hill is moving the solitons propagate in the upstream direction as precursors while wake structures consisting of linear DAWs are seen to propagate in the downstream region. A theoretical explanation of these excitations based on the forced Korteweg-deVries model equation is provided and their practical implications in situations involving a charged object moving in a plasma are discussed.",15,[],5

Although the function is only available for real values of time, we present a numerical technique to analytically continue the function to complex values of time, and with sufficient fidelity to locate and visualize the singularity closest to the real axis. Using this technique, we demonstrate a robust connection between temporal intermittency and the location of singularities in the complex plane.",15,[],5
1512.08033,physics,"Today's textbooks of electromagnetism give the particular solution to Maxwell's equations involving the integral over the charge and current sources at retarded times. However, the texts fail to emphasize the role played by the choice of the boundary conditions corresponding to solutions of the homogeneous Maxwell equations. Here we discuss the role of these boundary conditions for an experimenter with a hypothetical charged harmonic oscillator as his equipment. We describe the observations of the experimenter when located near a radio station or immersed in thermal radiation at temperature T. The classical physicists at the end of the 19th century chose the homogeneous boundary conditions for Maxwell's equation based upon the experimental observations of Lummer and Pringsheim which measured only the thermal radiation which exceeded the random radiation surrounding their measuring equipment. Today at the beginning of the 21st century, classical physicists must choose the homogeneous boundary conditions for Maxell's equations to correspond to the full radiation spectrum revealed by the recent Casimir force measurements which detect all the radiation surrounding conducting parallel plates, including the radiation absorbed and emitted by the plates themselves. The random classical radiation spectrum revealed by the Casimir force measurements includes electromagnetic zero-point radiation, which is missing from the spectrum measured by Lummer and Pringsheim, and which cannot be eliminated by going to zero temperature. This zero-point radiation will lead to zero-point energy for all systems which have electromagnetic interactions. Thus the choice of the boundary conditions on the homogeneous Maxwell equations is intimately related to the ideas of zero-point energy and non-radiating ground states which are introduced in classes of modern physics.",15,[],5

1506.05077,physics,"We model the response of a state of the art micro-hole single-stage charge amplication device (`microbulk' Micromegas) in a gaseous atmosphere consisting of Xenon/trimethylamine at various concentrations and pressures. The amplifying structure, made with photo-lithographic techniques similar to those followed in the fabrication of gas electron multipliers (GEMs), consisted of a 100 um-side equilateral-triangle pattern with 50 um-diameter holes placed at its vertexes. Once the primary electrons are guided into the holes by virtue of an optimized field configuration, avalanches develop along the 50 um-height channels etched out of the original doubly copper-clad polyimide foil. In order to properly account for the strong field gradients at the holes' entrance as well as for the fluctuations of the avalanche process (that ultimately determine the achievable energy resolution), we abandoned the hydrodynamic framework, resorting to a purely microscopic description of the electron trajectories as obtained from elementary cross-sections. We show that achieving a satisfactory description needs additional assumptions about atom-molecule (Penning) transfer reactions and charge recombination to be made.",15,[],5

1508.06101,physics,"Methods for modelling the electrical conductivity of dense plasmas and liquid metals, based upon the well-known Ziman formula, are reviewed from a general perspective, and some earlier inconsistencies relating to its application to finite temperature systems are resolved. A general formula for the conductivity of a Lorentzian two-component plasma in thermal equilibrium is derived from the Lenard-Balescu collision integral in which both energy and momentum exchange between ions and electrons are accounted for. This formula is used as a basis for some generalizations of the Ziman formula, which apply to plasmas of arbitrary degeneracy over a much wider range of conditions. These formulae implicitly include the collective motions of the ions, but neglect the collective motions of the electrons. Detailed consideration of the latter shows that they generally have a small effect on the conductivity. Conditions for the validity of the Ziman formula are derived. The extension of the general theory to arbitrarily low temperatures, where the ion dynamics become dominated by collective effects, in which dynamical ion correlations need to be taken into account, is shown to lead to the well-known Bloch formula. Consideration is given to non-Lorentzian plasmas by explicitly accounting for electron-electron collisions. Corrections to the Lorentzian model in the form of a power series in 1/Z are derived.",15,[],5
1508.04507,physics,"Purpose: To quantify the ability of correlation and regression analysis to extract the normal lung dose-response function from dose volume histogram (DVH) data. Methods: A local injury model is adopted, in which radiation-induced damage (functional loss) G is the integral of the DVH with function R(D). RP risk is H(G) where H() is the sigmoid cumulative distribution of functional reserve. RP incidence is a Bernoulli function of risk. A homogeneous patient cohort is assumed, allowing non-dose-related factors to be ignored. Clinically realistic DVHs are combined with the injury model to simulate RP data. Results: Correlation analysis is often used to identify predictor variables that are correlated with outcome, for inclusion in a predictive model. In the local injury model, all DVH metrics VD contribute to damage. Correlation analysis therefore has limited value. The subset of VD significantly correlated with incidence varies randomly from trial to trial due to random variations in the DVH set, and does not necessarily reveal anything useful about the patient cohort or the underlying biological dose-response relationship. Regression or matrix analysis can extract R(D) from damage or risk data, provided smoothness regularization is employed. Extraction of R(D) from incidence data was not successful, due to its higher level of statistical variability. Conclusions: To the author's knowledge, smoothness regularization has not been applied to this problem, so represents a novel approach. Dose-response functions can be successfully extracted from measurements of integral (as opposed to regional) lung damage G, suggesting value in re-visiting available measurements of ventilation, perfusion and radiographic damage. The techniques developed here can potentially be used to extract the dose-response functions of different tissues from multiple types of quantitative volumetric imaging data.",15,[],5

1502.08045,physics,"equation-ray spectra for positron annihilation with the core and valence electrons of the noble gas atoms Ar, Kr and Xe is calculated within the framework of diagrammatic many-body theory. The effect of positron-atom and short-range positron-electron correlations on the annihilation process is examined in detail. Short-range correlations, which are described through non-local corrections to the vertex of the annihilation amplitude, are found to significantly enhance the spectra for annihilation on the core orbitals. For Ar, Kr and Xe, the core contributions to the annihilation rate are found to be 0.55\%, 1.5\% and 2.2\% respectively, their small values reflecting the difficulty for the positron to probe distances close to the nucleus. Importantly however, the core subshells have a broad momentum distribution and markedly contribute to the annihilation spectra at Doppler energy shifts equation\,keV, and even dominate the spectra of Kr and Xe at shifts equation\,keV. Their inclusion brings the theoretical spectra into excellent agreement with the experimental equation-spectra across the full range of Doppler energy shifts. Additionally, the theory enables the calculation of the `exact' vertex enhancement factors equation for individual core and valence subshells equation. They are found to follow a simple and physically motivated scaling with the subshell ionization energy equation: equation, where equation, equation and equation are positive constants. It is demonstrated that these factors can be incorporated in simple independent-particle-model calculations to successfully reconstruct the true many-body annihilation equation-spectra. This formula can be used to determine the enhancement factors for positron annihilation with core electrons of atoms across the periodic table and condensed matter systems.",15,[],5

1511.07766,physics,"Well over a century after the discovery of the electron, we are still faced with serious conceptual issues regarding precisely what an electron is. Since the development of particle physics and the Standard Model, we have accumulated a great deal of knowledge about the relationships among various subatomic particles. However, this knowledge has not significantly aided in our understanding of the fundamental nature of any particular elementary subatomic particle. The fact that many particle properties, such as position, time, speed, energy, momentum, and component of spin, are observer-dependent suggests that these relevant variables do not represent properties per se, but rather the relationship between the observer and the observed. That is, they reflect details about how the electron influences the observer, and vice versa. Here we attempt to understand this by considering a simple model where particles influence one another in a discrete and direct fashion. The resulting framework, referred to as Influence Theory, is shown to faithfully reproduce a surprising amount of physics. While it would be naive to assume that the ideas presented here comprise anything resembling the final word on the matter, it is hoped that this work will demonstrate that a simple and understandable picture of particles, such as the electron, is indeed feasible and should be actively sought after.",15,[],5

This permits the non resonant wave obtained from such a SRO to be simultaneously powerful and frequency stable, which is usually impossible to obtain when the resonant wave frequency is stabilized.",15,[],5

This Letter presents an experimental study to identify the parameters that most strongly influence flux trapping in high purity niobium during cooldown. This is critical to the operation of superconducting radiofrequency cavities, in which trapped flux degrades the quality factor and therefore cryogenic efficiency. Flux expulsion was measured on a large survey of 1.3 GHz cavities prepared in various ways. It is shown that both spatial thermal gradient and high temperature treatment are critical to expelling external magnetic fields, while surface treatment has minimal effect. For the first time, it is shown that a cavity can be converted from poor expulsion behavior to strong expulsion behavior after furnace treatment, resulting in a substantial improvement in quality factor.

The suggested nanoparticle exhibits different backscatterings and, as an interesting consequence, different optical scattering forces for opposite illumination directions. An array of such nanoparticles provides different reflection phases when illuminated from opposite directions. With a proper geometrical tuning, this bianisotropic nanoparticle is capable of providing a equation phase change in the reflection spectrum while possessing a rather large and constant amplitude. This allows creating reflectarrays with near-perfect transmission out of the resonance band due to the absence of an usually employed metallic screen.",15,[],5
1512.04909,physics,"In this paper we study the morphology of drops formed on partially wetting substrates, whose footprint is not circular. This type of drops is a consequence of the breakup processes occurring in thin films when anisotropic contact line motions take place. The anisotropy is basically due to hysteresis effects of the contact angle since some parts of the contact line are wetting, while others are dewetting. Here, we obtain a peculiar drop shape from the rupture of a long liquid filament sitting on a solid substrate, and analyze its shape and contact angles by means of goniometric and refractive techniques. We also find a non--trivial steady state solution for the drop shape within the long wave approximation (lubrication theory), and compare most of its features with experimental data. This solution is presented both in Cartesian and polar coordinates, whose constants must be determined by a certain group of measured parameters. Besides, we obtain the dynamics of the drop generation from numerical simulations of the full Navier--Stokes equation, where we emulate the hysteretic effects with an appropriate spatial distribution of the static contact angle over the substrate.",15,[],5

1503.08966,physics,"Time delays of electrons emitted from an isotropic initial state and leaving behind an isotropic ion are assumed to be angle-independent. Using an interferometric method involving XUV attosecond pulse trains and an IR probe field in combination with a detection scheme, which allows for full 3D momentum resolution, we show that measured time delays between electrons liberated from the equation spherically symmetric ground state of helium depend on the emission direction of the electrons relative to the linear polarization axis of the ionizing XUV light. Such time-delay anisotropy, for which we measure values as large as 60 attoseconds, is caused by the interplay between final quantum states with different symmetry and arises naturally whenever the photoionization process involves the exchange of more than one photon in the field of the parent-ion. With the support of accurate theoretical models, the angular dependence of the time delay is attributed to small phase differences that are induced in the laser-driven continuum transitions to the final states. Since most measurement techniques tracing attosecond electron dynamics involve the exchange of at least two photons, this is a general, significant, and initially unexpected effect that must be taken into account in all such photoionization measurements.",15,[],5

Apart from the deterministic model predictions, the decision makers are often equally concerned about the predictions confidence. Among the uncertainties in RANS simulations, the model-form uncertainty is an important or even a dominant source. Therefore, quantifying and reducing the model-form uncertainties in RANS simulations are of critical importance to make risk-informed decisions. Researchers in statistics communities have made efforts on this issue by considering numerical models as black boxes. However, this physics-neutral approach is not a most efficient use of data, and is not practical for most engineering problems. Recently, we proposed an open-box, Bayesian framework for quantifying and reducing model-form uncertainties in RANS simulations by incorporating observation data and physics-prior knowledge. It can incorporate the information from the vast body of existing empirical knowledge with mathematical rigor, which enables a more efficient usage of data. In this work, we examine the merits of incorporating various types of prior knowledge in the uncertainties quantification and reduction in RANS simulations.

Importantly, while the width of the broadening is much larger than the energy separation of isotopes, only the shift in the peak positions must be detected if the beam is limited to a single atom.

1509.05503,physics,"The finite element analysis of high frequency vibrations of quartz crystal plates is a necessary process required in the design of quartz crystal resonators of precision types for applications in filters and sensors. The anisotropic materials and extremely high frequency in radiofrequency range of resonators determine that vibration frequency spectra are complicated with strong couplings of large number of different vibration modes representing deformations which do not appear in usual structural problems. For instance, the higher-order thickness-shear vibrations usually representing the sharp deformation of thin plates in the thickness direction, expecting the analysis is to be done with refined meshing schemes along the relatively small thickness and consequently the large plane area. To be able to represent the precise vibration mode shapes, a very large number of elements are needed in the finite element analysis with either the three-dimensional theory or the higher-order plate theory, although considerable reduction of numbers of degree-of-freedom (DOF) are expected for the two-dimensional analysis without scarifying the accuracy. In this paper, we reviewed the software architecture for the analysis and demonstrated the evaluation and tuning of parameters for the improvement of the analysis with problems of elements with a large number of DOF in each node, or a problem with unusually large bandwidth of the banded stiffness and mass matrices in comparison with conventional finite element formulation. Such a problem can be used as an example for the optimization and tuning of problems from multi-physics analysis which are increasingly important in applications with excessive large number of DOF and bandwidth in engineering.",15,[],5

We apply the formal theory to a thermodynamically closed system consisting of an antireflection coated block of dielectric situated in free-space and illuminated by a quasimonochromatic field. We show that valid theorems of the formal theory are proven false by relativity and by conservation laws. Then the axioms of the formal theory are proven false at a fundamental level of mathematical logic. We derive a new formal theory of continuum electrodynamics for macroscopic electric and magnetic fields in a four-dimensional flat non-Minkowski material spacetime in which the speed of light is c/n.,15,[],5
1501.03967,physics,"The particle transport of impurities in magnetically confined plasmas under some conditions does not find, neither quantitatively nor qualitatively, a satisfactory theory-based explanation. This compromise the successful realization of thermo-nuclear fusion for energy production since its accumulation is known to be one of the causes that leads to the plasma breakdown. In standard reactor-relevant conditions this accumulation is in most stellarators intrinsic to the lack of toroidal symmetry, that leads to the neoclassical electric field to point radially inwards. This statement, that the standard theory allows to formulate, has been contradicted by some experiments that showed weaker or no accumulation under such conditions \citeIdapop160561112009, Yoshinumanf490620022009. The charge state of the impurities makes its transport more sensitive to the electric fields. Thus, the short length scale turbulent electrostatic potential or its long wave-length variation on the flux surface equation -- that the standard neoclassical approach usually neglects -- might possibly shed some light on the experimental findings. In the present work the focus is put on the second of the two, and investigate its influence of the radial transport of Cequation. We show that in LHD it is strongly modified by equation, both resulting in mitigated/enhanced accumulation at internal/external radial positions; for Wendelstein 7-X, on the contrary, equation is expected to be considerably smaller and the transport of Cequation not affected up to an appreciable extent; and in TJ-II the potential shows a moderate impact despite of the large amplitude of equation for the parameters considered.",15,[],5

Based on two reasonable assumptions of (1) AHE eventually transfers to the Earth energy system and (2) the net warming is only driven by the net radioactive forcing (RF) from either GHG or other causes, we analyzed the role of AHE in global warming. The mean annual total AHE of the four main sources including energy consumption, residual heat of electricity generation, biomass decomposition by land use and cover change (LUCC) and food consumption was estimated to be 4.41*1020 J in 1970-2010, accounting for 6.23% of the net annual heat increase of the Earth reported by IPCC AR5 for the period. The mean annual radioactive forcing (RF) by AHE was up to 29.94 mW m(-2) globally in 1981-2010, less than the annual net increase of total GHG (34.80 mW m(-2)) but more that of CO2 (24.43 mW m(-2). The results suggested that AHE played a great role in global warming, urging us to pay more attention to DHE for a better evaluation of RF and more reasonable energy policy including non-GHG energy in the future (Keywords: climate change, anthropogenic direct heat emission, energy, radioactive forcing, heat balance, global warming).",15,[],5

A number of different solar wind phenomena have been studied over the past forty years with the intention of understanding and forecasting solar behavior. One of these phenomena in particular, Earth-bound interplanetary coronal mass ejections (CMEs), can significantly disturb the Earth's magnetosphere for a short time and cause geomagnetic storms. This publication presents a mission concept consisting of six spacecraft that are equally spaced in a heliocentric orbit at 0.72 AU. These spacecraft will monitor the plasma properties, the magnetic field's orientation and magnitude, and the 3D-propagation trajectory of CMEs heading for Earth. The primary objective of this mission is to increase space weather (SW) forecasting time by means of a near real-time information service, that is based upon in-situ and remote measurements of the aforementioned CME properties. The mission's secondary objective is to provide vital data to update scientific models. In-situ measurements are performed using a Solar Wind Analyzer instrumentation package and flux gate magnetometers, while coronagraphs execute remote measurements.

1509.05102,physics,"The rimming flow of a viscoelastic thin film inside a rotating horizontal cylinder is studied theoretically. Attention is given to the onset of non-Newtonian free-surface instability in creeping flow. This non-inertial instability has been observed in experiments, but current theoretical models of Newtonian fluids can neither describe its origin nor explain its onset. This study examines two models of non Newtonian fluids to see if the experimentally observed instability can be predicted analytically. The non-Newtonian viscosity and elastic properties of the fluid are described by the Generalized Newtonian Fluid (GNF) and Second Order Viscoelastic Fluid (SOVF) constitutive models, respectively. With linear stability analysis, it is found that, analogously to the Newtonian fluid, rimming flow of viscous non-Newtonian fluids (modeled by GNF) is neutrally stable. However, the viscoelastic properties of the fluid (modeled by SOVF) are found to contribute to the flow destabilization. The instability is shown to increase as the cylinder rotation rate is lowered, from which the fluid accumulates in a pool on the rising wall. Viscoelastic effects coupled with this pooling cause the fluid's angular stretching, which is suggested to be responsible for this onset of instability.",15,[],5

1504.06611,physics,"A series of recent works studying a database of chronologically sorted chess games --containing 1.4 million games played by humans between 1998 and 2007-- have shown that the popularity distribution of chess game-lines follows a Zipf's law, and that time series inferred from the sequences of those game-lines exhibit long-range memory effects. The presence of Zipf's law together with long-range memory effects was observed in several systems, however, the simultaneous emergence of these two phenomena were always studied separately up to now. In this work, by making use of a variant of the Yule-Simon preferential growth model, introduced by Cattuto et al., we provide an explanation for the simultaneous emergence of Zipf's law and long-range correlations memory effects in a chess database. We find that Cattuto's Model (CM) is able to reproduce both, Zipf's law and the long-range correlations, including size-dependent scaling of the Hurst exponent for the corresponding time series. CM allows an explanation for the simultaneous emergence of these two phenomena via a preferential growth dynamics, including a memory kernel, in the popularity distribution of chess game-lines. This mechanism results in an aging process in the chess game-line choice as the database grows. Moreover, we find burstiness in the activity of subsets of the most active players, although the aggregated activity of the pool of players displays inter-event times without burstiness. We show that CM is not able to produce time series with bursty behavior providing evidence that burstiness is not required for the explanation of the long-range correlation effects in the chess database.",15,[],5
1505.00351,q-bio,"Slow and accurate finger and limb movements are essential to daily activities, but their neural control and governing mechanics are relatively unexplored. We consider neuromechanical systems where slow movements are produced by neural commands that modulate muscle stiffness. This formulation based on strain-energy equilibria is in agreement with prior work on neural control of muscle and limb impedance. Slow limb movements are driftless in the sense that movement stops when neural commands stop. We demonstrate, in the context of two planar tendon-driven systems representing a finger and a leg, that the control of muscle stiffness suffices to produce stable and accurate limb postures and quasi-static (slow) transitions among them. We prove, however, that stable postures are achievable only when muscles are pre-tensioned, as is the case for natural muscle tone. Our results further indicate, in accordance with experimental findings, that slow movements are non-smooth. The non-smoothness arises because the precision with which individual muscle stiffnesses need to be controlled changes substantially throughout the limb's motion. These results underscore the fundamental roles of muscle tone and accurate neural control of muscle stiffness in producing stable limb postures and slow movements.",15,[],10

It has been extensively studied due to its misfolding/aggregation in and genetic linkage to neurodegenerative diseases, especially Parkinson's disease (PD). To better understand its biology, models of SNCA toxicity have been developed in budding yeast over the past decade, which have yielded insights into the protein's modes of action in specific pathways and potential therapeutic targets. Given that the synuclein gene family is not present in yeast, an extensive homology search was undertaken to determine if any yeast protein may possess structural homology to SNCA and whose native biology may shed more light on SNCA's pathomechanism in eukaryotes. We identified Zeo1, a membrane-associated protein involved in the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway, as a candidate structural homolog. We show that Zeo1 overexpression is toxic in yeast and, similar to SNCA, localizes to lipid membranes. A number of biochemical similarities between Zeo1 and SNCA also become apparent in light of this potential structural connection. Moreover, the yeast PKC1 gene, a kinase acting as a downstream signaling hub in the CWI pathway, rescues both SNCA- and Zeo1-induced toxicities. Using the same homology search methods that identified Zeo1, we show that Pkc1 has a hybrid structural similarity to PINK1 and PARIS, two mitochondrial PD-implicated proteins not generally linked directly to synuclein-specific pathobiology.

1510.00658,q-bio,"An important occurrence in many cellular contexts is the crossing of a prescribed threshold by a regulatory protein. The timing of such events is stochastic as a consequence of the innate randomness in gene expression. A question of interest is to understand how gene expression is regulated to achieve precision in event timing. To address this, we model event timing using the first-passage time framework - a mathe- matical tool to analyze the time when a stochastic process first crosses a specific threshold. The protein evolution is described via a simple stochastic model of gene expression. Moreover, we consider the feedback regulation of protein degradation to be a possible noise control mechanism employed to achieve the precision. Exact analytical formulas are developed for the distribution and moments of the first-passage time. Using these expressions, we investigate for the optimal feedback strategy such that noise (coefficient of variation squared) in event timing is minimized around a given fixed mean time. Our results show that the minimum noise is achieved when the protein degradation rate is zero for all protein levels. Lastly, the implications of this finding are discussed.",15,[],10

It is unclear how these seemingly random cell cycles can be reconciled with the precise regulation required under conditions where the generation time is shorter than the time to replicate the genome.

We find that the cell-to-cell variation in growth rate is sufficient to explain the corresponding variation in cell size and division timing assuming a simple mechanistic model. In the model, initiation of chromosome replication is triggered at a fixed volume per origin region, and associated with each initiation event is a division event at a growth rate dependent time later. The result implies that cell division in E. coli has no other regulation beyond what is needed to initiate DNA replication at the right volume.",15,[],10

1508.00165,q-bio,"Single trial analyses of ensemble activity in alert animals demonstrate that cortical circuits dynamics evolve through temporal sequences of metastable states. Metastability has been studied for its potential role in sensory coding, memory and decision-making. Yet, very little is known about the network mechanisms responsible for its genesis. It is often assumed that the onset of state sequences is triggered by an external stimulus. Here we show that state sequences can be observed also in the absence of overt sensory stimulation. Analysis of multielectrode recordings from the gustatory cortex of alert rats revealed ongoing sequences of states, where single neurons spontaneously attain several firing rates across different states. This single neuron multi-stability represents a challenge to existing spiking network models, where typically each neuron is at most bi-stable. We present a recurrent spiking network model that accounts for both the spontaneous generation of state sequences and the multi-stability in single neuron firing rates. Each state results from the activation of neural clusters with potentiated intra-cluster connections, with the firing rate in each cluster depending on the number of active clusters. Simulations show that the models ensemble activity hops among the different states, reproducing the ongoing dynamics observed in the data. When probed with external stimuli, the model predicts the quenching of single neuron multi-stability into bi-stability and the reduction of trial-by-trial variability. Both predictions were confirmed in the data. Altogether, these results provide a theoretical framework that captures both ongoing and evoked network dynamics in a single mechanistic model.",15,[],10

Recent studies of birds and mammals have used this approach to generate pseudo-posterior distributions of phylogenetic trees that are complete at the species level, even in the absence of genetic data for many species. Many researchers have used these distributions of phylogenies for downstream evolutionary analyses that involve inferences on phenotypic evolution, geography, and community assembly. I demonstrate that the use of phylogenies constructed in this fashion is inappropriate for many questions involving traits. Because species are placed on trees at random with respect to trait values, the birth-death polytomy resolver breaks down natural patterns of trait phylogenetic structure. Inferences based on these trees are predictably and often drastically biased in a direction that depends on the underlying (true) pattern of phylogenetic structure in traits. I illustrate the severity of the phenomenon for both continuous and discrete traits using examples from a global bird phylogeny.",15,[],10
1504.06727,q-bio,"The stability of ecosystems as well as the relation between topology and dynamics on multilayer networks are important questions that are usually discussed in separate communities. Here, we combine these two topics by investigating the influence of the topology of the migration network on the stability of a four-species foodweb module on six patches. The parameters are chosen such that the dynamics on an isolated patch have a periodic attractor with all four species present as well as an attractor where the prey that is preferred by the top predator dies out. The stability measure used here is robustness, which is the average proportion of surviving species in the system, and which shows a complex dependence on the migration rate. We use principal component analysis to quantify the migration network structure in terms of the most relevant network measures, and we evaluate correlations between these measures and characteristics of the robustness curves. Our most important findings are that higher connectivity of the migration network leads to a larger maximum robustness, that a broad distribution of connectivities favors extinction of the preferred prey at intermediate migration rates, and that migration topologies with a larger betweenness centrality are more prone to extinction of the preferred prey at the onset of synchronization. Our study thus demonstrates a strong correlation between dynamical robustness and spatial topology and can serve as an example for similar studies in other types of multilayer networks.",15,[],10

We discuss the sensitivity of the standard filtration and show cases where reticulate evolution can fail to be detected. We introduce an extension of the standard framework and define the median complex as a construction to recover signal of the frequency and scale of reticulate evolution by inferring and imputing putative ancestral states.

To quantify such complex evolutionary dynamics in vivo, time resolved and genome wide data including rare variants are essential.

We show that patterns of minor diversity are reproducible between patients and mirror global HIV-1 diversity, suggesting a universal landscape of fitness costs that control diversity. Reversions towards the ancestral HIV-1 sequence are observed throughout infection and account for almost one third of all sequence changes. Reversion rates depend strongly on conservation.

1501.05880,q-bio,"Models accounting for imperfect detection are important. Single-visit methods have been proposed as an alternative to multiple-visits methods to relax the assumption of closed population. Knape and Korner-Nievergelt (2015) showed that under certain models of probability of detection single-visit methods are statistically non-identifiable leading to biased population estimates. There is a close relationship between estimation of the resource selection probability function (RSPF) using weighted distributions and single-visit methods for occupancy and abundance estimation. We explain the precise mathematical conditions needed for RSPF estimation as stated in Lele and Keim (2006). The identical conditions, that remained unstated in our papers on single-visit methodology, are needed for single-visit methodology to work. We show that the class of admissible models is quite broad and does not excessively restrict the application of the RSPF or the single-visit methodology. To complement the work by Knape and Korner-Nievergelt, we study the performance of multiple-visit methods under the scaled logistic detection function and a much wider set of situations. In general, under the scaled logistic detection function multiple-visits methods also lead to biased estimates. As a solution to this problem, we extend the single-visit methodology to a class of models that allows use of scaled probability function. We propose a Multinomial extension of single visit methodology that can be used to check whether the detection function satisfies the RSPF condition or not. Furthermore, we show that if the scaling factor depends on covariates, then it can also be estimated.",15,[],10

Our previous work(1) showed that grid cells represent the most stable subset of a larger continuum of spatially periodic cells (SPCs) which deviate from the hexagonal symmetry observed in grid cells. Recently Navratilova et al(2) suggested that our findings reflected poor isolation of the spikes from multiple grid cells, rather than the existence of actual non-grid SPCs. Here we refute this suggestion by showing that: (i) most SPCs cannot be formed from hexagonal grids; (ii) all standard cluster isolation measures are similar between recorded grid cells and non-grid SPCs, and are comparable to those reported in other laboratories; (iii) the spikes from different fields of band-like SPCs do not differ.

1503.04572,q-bio,"Evolution depends on the fitness of organisms, the expected rate of reproducing. Directly getting offspring is the most basic form of fitness, but fitness can also be increased indirectly by helping genetically related individuals (such as kin) to increase their fitness. The combined effect is known as inclusive fitness. Here it is argued that a further elaboration of fitness has evolved, particularly in humans. It is called extensive fitness and it incorporates producing organisms that are merely similar in phenotype. The evolvability of this mechanism is illustrated by computations on a simple model combining heredity and behaviour. Phenotypes are driven into the direction of high fitness through a mechanism that involves an internal estimate of fitness, implicitly made within the organism itself. This mechanism has recently been conjectured to be responsible for producing agency and goals. In the model, inclusive and extensive fitness are both implemented by letting fitness increase nonlinearly with the size of subpopulations of similar heredity (for the indirect part of inclusive fitness) and of similar phenotype (for the phenotypic part of extensive fitness). Populations implementing extensive fitness outcompete populations implementing mere inclusive fitness. This occurs because groups with similar phenotype tend to be larger than groups with similar heredity, and fitness increases more when groups are larger. Extensive fitness has two components, a direct component where individuals compete in inducing others to become like them and an indirect component where individuals cooperate and help others who are already similar to them.",15,[],10

Our results clarify the relative impact of the two components on these statistics. We provide a rigorous interpretation of positive or negative values of an important class of neutrality tests in terms of the underlying tree shape. In particular, we show that values of Tajima's equation and Fay and Wu's equation depend in a direct way on a peculiar measure of tree balance which is mostly determined by the root balance of the tree. We present a new test for selection in the same class as Fay and Wu's equation and discuss its interpretation and power.

Besides, we describe functional models (perceptron and SOM) which obtain significant advantages, while using MMBANN. In particular, the perceptron based on MMBANN, gets specificity gain in orders of error probabilities values, MMBANN SOM obtains real neurophysiological meaning, the number of possible grandma cells increases 1000- fold with MMBANN. Each set of markers has a metric, which is used to make connections between neurons containing the markers.

1511.05227,q-bio,"The use of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) equations abounds in the literature, but the identifiability of the HH model parameters has not been broadly considered. Identifiability analysis addresses the question of whether it is possible to estimate the model parameters for a given choice of measurement data and experimental inputs. Here we explore the structural identifiability properties of a generalized form of HH from voltage clamp data. Through a scaling argument, we conclude that the steady-state gating variables are not identifiable from voltage clamp data, and then further show that their product together with the conductance term forms an identifiable combination. We additionally show that these parameters become identifiable when the initial conditions for each of the gating variables are known. The time constants for each gating variable are shown to be identifiable, and a novel method for estimating them is presented. Finally, the exponents of the gating variables are shown to be identifiable in the two-gate case, and we conjecture these to be identifiable in the general case. These results are broadly applicable to models using HH-like formalisms, and show in general which parameters and combinations of parameters are possible to estimate from voltage clamp data.",15,[],10

Specifically of interest is the emergence of cooperation and multicellularity where the fitness of individuals often appears in conflict with that of the population. Theories of social evolution and evolutionary game theory have produced a number of fruitful results employing two-state two-body frameworks. In this study we depart from this tradition and instead consider a multi-player, multi-state evolutionary game, in which the fitness of an agent is determined by its relationship to an arbitrary number of other agents. We show that populations organize themselves in one of four distinct phases of interdependence depending on one parameter, selection strength. Some of these phases involve the formation of specialized large-scale structures.

1511.06427,q-bio,"Modularity is an important topological attribute for functional brain networks. Recent studies have reported that modularity of functional networks varies not only across individuals being related to demographics and cognitive performance, but also within individuals co-occurring with fluctuations in network properties of functional connectivity, estimated over short time intervals. However, characteristics of these time-resolved functional networks during periods of high and low modularity have remained largely unexplored. In this study we investigate spatiotemporal properties of time-resolved networks in the high and low modularity periods during rest, with a particular focus on their spatial connectivity patterns, temporal homogeneity and test-retest reliability. We show that spatial connectivity patterns of time-resolved networks in the high and low modularity periods are represented by increased and decreased dissociation of the default mode network module from task-positive network modules, respectively. We also find that the instances of time-resolved functional connectivity sampled from within the high (low) modularity period are relatively homogeneous (heterogeneous) over time, indicating that during the low modularity period the default mode network interacts with other networks in a variable manner. We confirmed that the occurrence of the high and low modularity periods varies across individuals with moderate inter-session test-retest reliability and that it is correlated with previously-reported individual differences in the modularity of functional connectivity estimated over longer timescales. Our findings illustrate how time-resolved functional networks are spatiotemporally organized during periods of high and low modularity, allowing one to trace individual differences in long-timescale modularity to the variable occurrence of network configurations at shorter timescales.",15,[],10
1506.00349,q-bio,"The stochastic Eigen model proposed by Feng et al. (Journal of theoretical biology, 246 (2007) 28) showed that error threshold is no longer a phase transition point but a crossover region whose width depends on the strength of the random fluctuation in an environment. The underlying cause of this phenomenon has not yet been well examined. In this article, we adopt a single peak Gaussian distributed fitness landscape instead of a constant one to investigate and analyze the change of the error threshold and the statistical property of the quasi-species population. We find a roughly linear relation between the width of the error threshold and the fitness fluctuation strength. For a given quasi-species, the fluctuation of the relative concentration has a minimum with a normal distribution of the relative concentration at the maximum of the averaged relative concentration, it has however a largest value with a bimodal distribution of the relative concentration near the error threshold.

1509.02816,q-bio,"Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and eQTL analyses have produced a large and growing number of genetic associations linked to a wide range of human phenotypes. As of 2013, there were more than 11,000 SNPs associated with a trait as reported in the NHGRI GWAS Catalog. However, interpreting the functional roles played by these SNPs remains a challenge. Here we describe an approach that uses the inherent bipartite structure of eQTL networks to place SNPs into a functional context.   Using genotyping and gene expression data from 163 lung tissue samples in a study of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) we calculated eQTL associations between SNPs and genes and cast significant associations (FDR equation) as links in a bipartite network. To our surprise, we discovered that the highly-connected ""hub"" SNPs within the network were devoid of disease-associations. However, within the network we identified 35 highly modular communities, which comprise groups of SNPs associated with groups of genes; 13 of these communities were significantly enriched for distinct biological functions (P equation) including COPD-related functions. Further, we found that GWAS-significant SNPs were enriched at the cores of these communities, including previously identified GWAS associations for COPD, asthma, and pulmonary function, among others. These results speak to our intuition: rather than single SNPs influencing single genes, we see groups of SNPs associated with the expression of families of functionally related genes and that disease SNPs are associated with the perturbation of those functions. These methods are not limited in their application to COPD and can be used in the analysis of a wide variety of disease processes and other phenotypic traits.",15,[],10

1508.02408,q-bio,"Large-scale simultaneous mRNA translation and the resulting competition for the available ribosomes has important implications to the cell's functioning and evolution. Developing a better understanding of the intricate correlations between these simultaneous processes, rather than focusing on the translation of a single isolated transcript, should help in gaining a better understanding of mRNA translation regulation and the way elongation rates affect organismal fitness. A model of simultaneous translation is specifically important when dealing with highly expressed genes, as these consume more resources. In addition, such a model can lead to more accurate predictions that are needed in the interconnection of translational modules in synthetic biology. We develop and analyze a general model for large-scale simultaneous mRNA translation and competition for ribosomes. This is based on combining several ribosome flow models (RFMs) interconnected via a pool of free ribosomes. We prove that the compound system always converges to a steady-state and that it always entrains or phase locks to periodically time-varying transition rates in any of the mRNA molecules. We use this model to explore the interactions between the various mRNA molecules and ribosomes at steady-state. We show that increasing the length of an mRNA molecule decreases the production rate of all the mRNAs. Increasing any of the codon translation rates in a specific mRNA molecule yields a local effect: an increase in the translation rate of this mRNA, and also a global effect: the translation rates in the other mRNA molecules all increase or all decrease. These results suggest that the effect of codon decoding rates of endogenous and heterologous mRNAs on protein production is more complicated than previously thought.",15,[],10
1507.06262,q-bio,"Jean-Baptiste Lamarck was among first to suggest that certain acquired traits may be heritable from parents to offspring. In this study, I examine whether and what aspects of sensorimotor conditioning by parents prior to conception may influence the behavior of subsequent generations in Drosophila. Using genetic and anatomic techniques, I find that both first- and second-generation offspring of parents who underwent prolonged olfactory training over multiple days displayed a distinct response bias to the same specific trained odors. The offspring displayed an enhanced anemotactic approach response to the trained odors, however, and did not differentiate between orders based on whether parental training was aversive or appetitive. Consequently, disruption of both olfactory-receptor and dorsal-paired-medial neuron input into the mushroom bodies abolished this change in offspring response, but disrupting synaptic output from a/b neurons of the mushroom body themselves had little effect on behavior even though they remained necessary for enacting newly trained conditioned responses. These observations identify a unique transgenerational dissociation between parentally-trained conditioned and unconditioned sensory stimuli, and provide a putative neural basis for how sensorimotor experiences in insects may bias the behavior of subsequent generations.",15,[],10

1511.05548,q-bio,"Genome sizes have evolved to vary widely, from 250 bases in viroids to 670 billion bases in amoeba.

While comparative genomics analyses have uncovered some of the relationships between these diverse evolutionary factors, we still do not understand what drives genome size evolution. Specifically, it is not clear how primordial mutational processes of base substitutions, insertions, and deletions influence genome size evolution in asexual organisms. Here, we use digital evolution to investigate genome size evolution by tracking genome edits and their fitness effects in real time. In agreement with empirical data, we find that mutation rate is inversely correlated with genome size in asexual populations. We show that at low point mutation rate, insertions are significantly more beneficial than deletions, driving genome expansion and acquisition of phenotypic complexity. Conversely, high mutational load experienced at high mutation rates inhibits genome growth, forcing the genomes to compress genetic information. Our analyses suggest that the inverse relationship between mutation rate and genome size is a result of the tradeoff between evolving phenotypic innovation and limiting the mutational load.",15,[],10

Numerical simulation results show that the error threshold in the fully random model appears as a crossover region instead of a phase transition point, and as the fluctuation strength increases the crossover region becomes smoother and smoother. Furthermore, it is shown that the randomization of the mutation rate plays a dominant role in changing the error threshold in the fully random model, which is consistent with the existing experimental data. The implication of the threshold change due to the randomization for antiviral strategies is discussed.",15,[],10

Both the nicotinamide ring and the adenosine part of the substrate molecule have been found to be important for binding to the polypeptide chain. However, in the case of NADPH, the 2'-phosphate group destabilized almost completely the interaction with the adenosine moiety. Moreover, NADPH and NMNH are very good substrates for the flavin reductase, and we have shown that both these molecules bind to the enzyme almost exclusively by the nicotinamide ring. This provides evidence that the flavin reductase exhibits a unique mode for recognition of the reduced pyridine nucleotide.

But more importantly, recently proposed geometric notions of curvature on very general metric measure spaces allow us to utilize a whole new set of tools and ideas that help quantify functionality and robustness of graphs. In particular, robustness is closely connected to network entropy which, in turn, is very closely related to curvature. We will see that there are a number of alternative notions of discrete curvature that are compatible with the classical Riemannian definition, each having its own advantages and disadvantages, and are relevant to networks of interest.

1509.01913,q-bio,"In human locomotion, sensorimotor synchronization of gait consists of the coordination of stepping with rhythmic auditory cues (auditory cueing, AC). AC changes the long-range correlations among consecutive strides (fractal dynamics) into anti-correlations. Visual cueing (VC) is the alignment of step lengths with marks on the floor. The effects of VC on the fluctuation structure of walking have not been investigated. Therefore, the objective was to compare the effects of AC and VC on the fluctuation pattern of basic spatiotemporal gait parameters. Thirty-six healthy individuals walked 3 x 500 strides on an instrumented treadmill with augmented reality capabilities. The conditions were no cueing (NC), AC, and VC. AC included an isochronous metronome. In VC, projected stepping stones were synchronized with the treadmill speed. Detrended fluctuation analysis assessed the correlation structure. The coefficient of variation (CV) was also assessed. The results showed that AC and VC similarly induced a strong anti-correlated pattern in the gait parameters. The CVs were similar between the NC and AC conditions but substantially higher in the VC condition.

1511.01703,q-bio,"Deprivation of essential nutrients can have stark consequences for many processes in a cell. We consider amino acid starvation, which can result in bottlenecks in mRNA translation when ribosomes stall due to lack of resources, i.e. tRNAs charged with the missing amino acid. Recent experiments also show less obvious effects such as increased charging of other (non-starved) tRNA species and selective charging of isoaccepting tRNAs. We present a mechanism which accounts for these observations, and shows that production of some proteins can actually increase under starvation. One might assume that such responses could only be a result of sophisticated control pathways, but here we show that these effects can occur naturally due to changes in the supply and demand for different resources, and that control can be accomplished through selective use of rare codons. We develop a model for translation which includes the dynamics of the charging and use of aa-tRNAs, explicitly taking into account the effect of specific codon sequences. This constitutes a new control mechanism in gene regulation which emerges at the community level, i.e., via resources used by all ribosomes.",15,[],10
1504.08116,q-bio,"Nature presents multiple intriguing examples of processes which proceed at high precision and regularity. This remarkable stability is frequently counter to modelers' experience with the inherent stochasticity of chemical reactions in the regime of low copy numbers. Moreover, the effects of noise and nonlinearities can lead to ""counter-intuitive"" behavior, as demonstrated for a basic enzymatic reaction scheme that can display stochastic focusing (SF). Under the assumption of rapid signal fluctuations, SF has been shown to convert a graded response into a threshold mechanism, thus attenuating the detrimental effects of signal noise. However, when the rapid fluctuation assumption is violated, this gain in sensitivity is generally obtained at the cost of very large product variance, and this unpredictable behavior may be one possible explanation of why, more than a decade after its introduction, SF has still not been observed in real biochemical systems.   In this work we explore the noise properties of a simple enzymatic reaction mechanism with a small and fluctuating number of active enzymes that behaves as a high-gain, noisy amplifier due to SF caused by slow enzyme fluctuations. We then show that the inclusion of a plausible negative feedback mechanism turns the system from a noisy signal detector to a strong homeostatic mechanism by exchanging high gain with strong attenuation in output noise and robustness to parameter variations. Moreover, we observe that the discrepancy between deterministic and stochastic descriptions of stochastically focused systems in the evolution of the means almost completely disappears, despite very low molecule counts and the additional nonlinearity due to feedback.

A variety of information theoretic quantities are in common use in neuroscience - (see entry ""Summary of Information-Theoretic Quantities""). Estimating these quantities in an accurate and unbiased way from real neurophysiological data frequently presents challenges, which are explained in this entry.",15,[],10
1509.01434,q-bio,"Understanding what controls apparently random fluctuations in fish recruitment is a major challenge in fisheries science. Our current inability to anticipate recruitment failures has led to costly management actions and in some cases complete fishery collapse. Time series observations of fish recruitment reflect an interplay of underlying population processes, environmental forcing, measurement error, and process error. Given that the error component is often very strong, an important unresolved question is whether any non-random signal can be uncovered in the annual fluctuations of recruitment time series. Here, we address this fundamental question in an analysis of 569 fish populations from a global database of recruitment. Using a nonparametric time series analysis method, we find overwhelming evidence for non-random dynamics operating in the recruitment process. Unlike previous explorations of this topic, our approach does not require the specification of a stock-recruitment model, and it can be used on recruitment estimates derived from a wide-range of abundance estimation methods. The evidence for non-randomness is robust across a wide range of fish families and abundance estimation methods. We also find that the statistical support for non-randomness increases consistently with the number of observations of a fish stock. This result provides the encouraging news that with continued observations, and the appropriate covariates, we should ultimately be able to uncover the mechanistic drivers of fish recruitment.",15,[],10
1506.03339,q-bio,"Testing symptomatic individuals for a disease can deliver treatment resources, if tests' results turn positive, which speeds up their treatment and might also decrease individuals' contacts to other ones. An imperfect test, however, might incorrectly consider susceptible individuals to be infected (false positives). In this case, testing reduces the epidemic in the expense of potentially misclassifying individuals. We present a mathematical model that describes the dynamics of an infectious disease and its testing. Susceptible individuals turn to ""susceptible but deemed infected"" at rate equation. Infected individuals go to a state ""infected and tested positive"" at rate equation. Both of these rates are functions of test's sensitivity and specificity. Analysis of the model permits us to derive an expression for equation and to find the conditions for reaching equation, i.e., when the disease--free equilibrium is stable. We find that under certain conditions it is possible to get equation, when originally, i.e., without testing, we would have equation. We also present numerical results to cover interesting scenarios such as using different tests and to compare these results.",15,[],10

1506.04301,q-bio,"The characterization of coordinated activity in neuronal populations has received renewed interest in the light of advancing experimental techniques which allow recordings from multiple units simultaneously. Across both in vitro and in vivo preparations, nearby neurons show coordinated responses when spontaneously active, and when subject to external stimuli. Recent work (Truccolo, Hochberg, & Donoghue, 2010) has connected these coordinated responses to behavior, showing that small ensembles of neurons in arm related areas of sensorimotor cortex can reliably predict single-neuron spikes in behaving monkeys and humans. We investigate this phenomenon utilizing an analogous point process model, showing that in the case of a computational model of cortex responding to random background inputs, one is similarly able to predict the future state of a single neuron by considering its own spiking history, together with the spiking histories of randomly sampled ensembles of nearby neurons. This model exhibits realistic cortical architecture and displays bursting episodes in the two distinct connectivity schemes studied. We conjecture that the baseline predictability we find in these instances is characteristic of locally connected networks more broadly considered.",15,[],10

However, it is unclear whether cortical ensembles could operate a BMI for whole-body navigation. Here we show that rhesus monkeys can learn to navigate a robotic wheelchair while seated on top of it, and using their cortical activity as the robot control signal. Two monkeys were chronically implanted with multichannel electrode arrays which simultaneously sampled activity of roughly 150 premotor and sensorimotor cortex neurons per monkey. This neuronal ensemble activity was transformed by a linear decoder into the robotic wheelchair's translational and rotational velocities. During several weeks of training, monkeys significantly improved their ability to navigate the wheelchair toward the location of a food reward. The navigation was enacted by ensemble modulations attuned to the whole-body displacements, and also to the distance to the food location. These results demonstrate that intracranial BMIs could restore whole-body mobility to severely paralyzed patients in the future.",15,[],10
1509.07842,q-bio,"Molecular noise in gene regulatory networks has two intrinsic components, one part being due to fluctuations caused by the birth and death of protein or mRNA molecules which are often present in small numbers and the other part arising from gene state switching, a single molecule event. Stochastic dynamics of gene regulatory circuits appears to be largely responsible for bifurcations into a set of multi-attractor states that encode different cell phenotypes. The interplay of dichotomous single molecule gene noise with the nonlinear architecture of genetic networks generates rich and complex phenomena. In this paper we elaborate on an approximate framework that leads to simple hybrid multi-scale schemes well suited for the quantitative exploration of the steady state properties of large-scale cellular genetic circuits.Through a path sum based analysis of trajectory statistics we elucidate the connection of these hybrid schemes to the underlying master equation and provide a rigorous justification for using dichotomous noise based models to study genetic networks. Numerical simulations of circuit models reveal that the contribution of the genetic noise of single molecule origin to the total noise is significant for a wide range of kinetic regimes.",15,[],10
1505.03905,q-bio,"Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome, Werner syndrome, and Cockayne syndrome are three genetic disorders, in which the children have premature aging features. To understand the phenomenon of premature aging, the similarity of aging features in these syndromes to that in normal aging is investigated. Although these three syndromes have different genetic backgrounds, all the patients have abnormal structures of tissues/organs like that in normal aging. Therefore, the abnormality in tissue structure is the common point in premature aging and normal aging. This abnormality links also a defective development and a defective repair, the Misrepair. Defective development is a result of Mis-construction of the structure of tissues and organs as consequence of genetic mutations. Aging is a result of Mis-reconstructions, the Misrepairs, for maintaining the structure of tissues/organs. Construction-reconstruction of the structure of an organism is thus the coupling point of development and aging. Mis- construction and Mis-reconstruction (Misrepair) are the essential processes for the development of aging-like feathers. In conclusion, premature aging is a result of Mis- construction of tissues and organs during body development as consequence of genetic disorders.",15,[],10

We here develop a theory for the dynamics of evolution in a rugged, modular fitness landscape. We show analytically how horizontal gene transfer couples to the modularity in the system and leads to more rapid rates of evolution at short times. The model, in general, analytically demonstrates a selective pressure for the prevalence of modularity in biology.

To study this process, we developed a model that allows analysis of live-cell images of migrating keratinocytes in culture based on a small number of parameters, including the radius of the cells, their mass and their polarization. This computational approach allowed the analysis of cell migration at the front of the wound and a reliable identification and quantification of the impaired polarization and migration of keratinocytes from mice lacking fibroblast growth factors 1 and 2 an established model of impaired healing.

1503.07518,q-bio,"The assumption that vector mortality remains constant with age is used widely to assess malaria transmission risk and predict the public health consequences of vector control strategies. However, laboratory studies commonly demonstrate clear evidence of senescence, or a decrease in physiological function and increase in vector mortality rate with age. We developed methods to integrate available field data to understand mortality in wild Anopheles gambiae, the most import vector of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. We found evidence for an increase in rates of mortality with age, a component of senescence. As expected, we also found that overall mortality is far greater in wild cohorts than commonly observed under protected laboratory conditions. The magnitude of senescence increases with An. gambiae lifespan, implying that wild mosquitoes die long before cohorts can exhibit strong senescence. We reviewed available published mortality studies of Anopheles spp. to confirm this fundamental prediction of aging in wild populations. Senescence becomes most apparent in long-living mosquito cohorts, and cohorts with low extrinsic mortality, such as those raised under protected laboratory conditions, suffer a relatively high proportion of senescent deaths. Imprecision in estimates of vector mortality and changes in mortality with age will severely bias models of vector borne disease transmission risk, such as malaria, and the sensitivity of transmission to bias increases as the extrinsic incubation period of the parasite decreases. While we focus here on malaria, we caution that future models for anti-vectorial interventions must therefore incorporate both realistic mortality rates and age-dependent changes in vector mortality.",15,[],10

The predicted contacts allow all-atom blinded 3D structure prediction at good accuracy for several known RNA structures and RNA-protein complexes. For unknown structures, we predict contacts in 160 non-coding RNA families.

1505.05670,q-bio,"Currently, most of the basic mechanisms governing tumor-immune system interactions, in combination with modulations of tumor-associated vasculature, are far from being completely understood. Here, we propose a mathematical model of vascularized tumor growth, where the main novelty is the modeling of the interplay between functional tumor vasculature and effector cell recruitment dynamics. Parameters are calibrated on the basis of different in vivo immunocompromised Rag1-/- and wild-type (WT) BALB/c murine tumor growth experiments. The model analysis supports that tumor vasculature normalization can be a plausible and effective strategy to treat cancer when combined with appropriate immuno-stimulations. We find that improved levels of functional tumor vasculature, potentially mediated by normalization or stress alleviation strategies, can provide beneficial outcomes in terms of tumor burden reduction and growth control. Normalization of tumor blood vessels opens a therapeutic window of opportunity to augment the antitumor immune responses, as well as to reduce the intratumoral immunosuppression and induced-hypoxia due to vascular abnormalities. The potential success of normalizing tumor-associated vasculature closely depends on the effector cell recruitment dynamics and tumor sizes. Furthermore, an arbitrary increase of initial effector cell concentration does not necessarily imply a better tumor control. We evidence the existence of an optimal concentration range of effector cells for tumor shrinkage. Based on these findings, we suggest a theory-driven therapeutic proposal that optimally combines immuno- and vaso-modulatory interventions.",15,[],10
1508.04241,q-bio,"Single unit recordings in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) have revealed a population of cells with conceptually based, highly selective activity, indicating the presence of a sparse neural code. Building off previous work by the author and J.C. Collins, this paper develops a statistical model for analyzing this data, based on maximum likelihood analysis. The goal is to infer the underlying distribution of neural response probabilities across the population of MTL cells. The response probability, or neuronal sparsity, is defined as the total probability that the neuron produces an above-threshold firing rate during the presentation of a randomly selected stimulus. Applying the method, it is shown that a beta-distributed neuronal sparsity across the cells of the MTL is consistent with the data. The resulting fits reveal a sparse and highly skewed code, with a huge majority of neurons exhibiting extremely low response probabilities, and a smaller minority possessing considerably higher response probabilities. The distributions are closely approximated by a power law at low sparsity values. Strikingly similar skewed distributions have been found in the statistics of place cell activity in rats, suggesting similar underlying coding dynamics between the human MTL and the rat hippocampus.",15,[],10

We make a strong case to verify our hypothesis by showing that the neural networks with the closest graph distance to the brain networks of Caenorhabditis elegans and humans are the Hindmarsh-Rose neural networks evolved with coupling strengths that maximize information flow capacity. Surprisingly, we find that global neural synchronization levels decrease during brain evolution, reflecting on an underlying global no Hebbian-like evolution process, which is driven by no Hebbian-like learning behaviors for some of the clusters during evolution, and Hebbian-like learning rules for clusters where neurons increase their synchronization.",15,[],10

We used Nadaraya-Watson non-parametric regression in both directions and age-stratified Spearman correlation to detect possible relations. Despite strong correlations among HR/HRV measures and among psychological measures, correlations between HR/HRV and psychological measures were low and non-significant for the overall sample. However, we found an age dependency, suggesting some correlations in younger people (HR with STAI-State, r = 0.39; with HADS-Anxiety, r = 0.52; both p < .005).

Moreover, these shape parameters are determined for over 250 cells across approximately 10000 total generations, which affords high statistical precision. Our data and model show that constriction is initiated early in the cell cycle and that its dynamics are controlled by the time scale of exponential longitudinal growth. Based on our extensive and detailed growth and contour data, we develop a minimal mechanical model that quantitatively accounts for the cell shape dynamics and suggests that the asymmetric location of the division plane reflects the distinct mechanical properties of the stalked and swarmer poles. Furthermore, we find that the asymmetry in the division plane location is inherited from the previous generation.

1502.00399,q-bio,"The first steps in the neural processing of sound are located in the auditory nerve and in the cochlear nuclei. To model the signal processing efficiently, we propose a simple mathematical tool that takes the minute timing of the system into account. In contrast to the situation in the cortex, the number of connections between neurons in auditory periphery is comparatively low. This gives way to an accurate modeling of the connectivity of the neuronal network. The timing is the all important feature in the peripheral neuronal auditory pathway. The primary auditory neurons e.g. phase lock to periodic sounds with important interactions with respect to both the refractory periods of the neurons and to the time delays caused by traveling times along the basilar membrane or through a synaptic connection. The mathematical tools provide a solid basis to build models for peripheral auditory processes. In particular, we study carefully a large class of refractory neurons, find analytical formulas for the spiking activity, and prove that refractory neurons respond to periodic signals by asymptotically periodic output. The methods rely on the theory of positive operators and give a numerical scheme for finding fixed points to an integral operator with geometric convergence rate. In addition, we consider a perfect integrator neuron, mathematically equivalent to randomized random walk, where the random walk is bounded from below, and solve the first passage time problem using continuous time Markov chain techniques. In an accompanying paper we set up the simulation framework as a counterpart to the present mathematical model.

1512.09133,q-bio,"Brain oscillations exhibit long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs), which reflect the regularity of their fluctuations: low values representing more random (decorrelated) while high values more persistent (correlated) dynamics. LRTCs constitute supporting evidence that the brain operates near criticality, a state where neuronal activities are balanced between order and randomness. Here, healthy adults used closed-loop brain training (neurofeedback, NFB) to reduce the amplitude of alpha oscillations, producing a significant increase in spontaneous LRTCs post-training. This effect was reproduced in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder, where abnormally random dynamics were reversed by NFB, correlating with significant improvements in hyperarousal. Notably, regions manifesting abnormally low LRTCs (i.e., excessive randomness) normalized toward healthy population levels, consistent with theoretical predictions about self-organized criticality. Hence, when exposed to appropriate training, spontaneous cortical activity reveals a residual capacity for ""self-tuning"" its own temporal complexity, despite manifesting the abnormal dynamics seen in individuals with psychiatric disorder. Lastly, we observed an inverse-U relationship between strength of LRTC and oscillation amplitude, suggesting a breakdown of long-range dependence at high/low synchronization extremes, in line with recent computational models. Together, our findings offer a broader mechanistic framework for motivating research and clinical applications of NFB, encompassing disorders with perturbed LRTCs.",15,[],10

The problem has been studied in a variety of tasks and with stimuli of differing complexity. However, the impact of correlations in sensory noise on perceptual judgments is not well understood. Here we examine how stimulus correlations together with correlations in sensory noise impact decision making. As an example, we consider the task of detecting the presence of a single or multiple targets amongst distractors. We assume that both the distractors and the observer's measurements of the stimuli are correlated. The computations of an optimal observer in this task are nontrivial, yet can be analyzed and understood intuitively. We find that when distractors are strongly correlated, measurement correlations can have a strong impact on performance. When distractor correlations are weak, measurement correlations have little impact, unless the number of stimuli is large.

1509.02580,q-bio,"Here we describe an ""information based exchange"" model of brain function that ascribes to neocortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus distinct network functions. The model allows us to analyze whole brain system set point measures, such as the rate and heterogeneity of transitions in striatum and neocortex, in the context of disease perturbations. Our closed-loop model invokes different forms of plasticity at specific tissue interfaces and their principle cell synapses to achieve these transitions. By modulating information based exchange of action potentials between modeled neocortical areas, we observe changes to these measures in simulation. We hypothesize that similar dynamic set points and modulations exist in the brain's resting state activity, and that germ line modifications of information based exchange may increase the risk of diseases such as Huntington's, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's. Disturbances in synaptic plasticity at distinct tissue interfaces in the model may be used to estimate risks of system dysfunction and neuronal cell death from quantitative analyses of the global dynamics that maintain system set points. The model is targeted for further development using IBM's Neural Tissue Simulator, which allows scalable elaboration of networks, tissues, and their neural and synaptic components towards ever greater complexity and biological realism.

1511.03963,q-bio,We examine immunostaining experimental data for the formation of the strip 2 of equation (equation) transcripts on equation equation embryos. An estimate of the factor converting immunofluorescence intensity units into molecular numbers is given. The analysis of the equation mRNA's dynamics at the region of the stripe 2 suggests that the promoter site of the gene has two distinct regimes: an earlier phase when it is predominantly activated until a critical time when it becomes mainly repressed. That suggests proposing a stochastic binary model for gene transcription on equation equation embryos. Our model has two random variables: the transcripts number and the state of the source of mRNAs given as active or repressed. We are able to reproduce available experimental data for the average number of transcripts. An analysis of the random fluctuations on the number of equation mRNA's and their consequences on the spatial precision of the stripe 2 is presented. We show that the position of the anterior/posterior borders fluctuate around their average position by equation of the embryo length which is similar to what is found experimentally.

To improve the mixing properties of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that traverses the space of species trees, we implement two efficient MCMC proposals: the first is based on the Subtree Pruning and Regrafting (SPR) algorithm and the second is based on a novel node-slider algorithm. Like the Nearest-Neighbor Interchange (NNI) algorithm we implemented previously, both algorithms propose changes to the species tree, while simultaneously altering the gene trees at multiple genetic loci to automatically avoid conflicts with the newly-proposed species tree. The method integrates over gene trees, naturally taking account of the uncertainty of gene tree topology and branch lengths given the sequence data. A simulation study was performed to examine the statistical properties of the new method. We found that it has excellent statistical performance, inferring the correct species tree with near certainty when analyzing 10 loci. The prior on species trees has some impact, particularly for small numbers of loci. An empirical dataset (for rattlesnakes) was reanalyzed.

1510.00815,q-bio,"Background: Synthetic lethality (SL) refers to the genetic interaction between two or more genes where only their co-alteration (e.g. by mutations, amplifications or deletions) results in cell death. In recent years, SL has emerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy against cancer: by targeting the SL partners of altered genes in cancer cells, these cells can be selectively killed while sparing the normal cells. Consequently, a number of studies have attempted prediction of SL interactions in human, a majority by extrapolating SL interactions inferred through large-scale screens in model organisms. However, these predicted SL interactions either do not hold in human cells or do not include genes that are (frequently) altered in human cancers, and are therefore not attractive in the context of cancer therapy.   Results: Here, we develop a computational approach to infer SL interactions directly from frequently altered genes in human cancers. It is based on the observation that pairs of genes that are altered in a (significantly) mutually exclusive manner in cancers are likely to constitute lethal combinations. Using genomic copy-number and gene-expression data from four cancers, breast, prostate, ovarian and uterine (total 3980 samples) from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we identify 718 genes that are frequently amplified or upregulated, and are likely to be synthetic lethal with six key DNA-damage response (DDR) genes in these cancers. By comparing with published data on gene essentiality (~16000 genes) from ten DDR-deficient cancer cell lines, we show that our identified genes are enriched among the top quartile of essential genes in these cell lines, implying that our inferred genes are highly likely to be (synthetic) lethal upon knockdown in these cell lines.",15,[],10
1512.03949,q-bio,"In 1938, H. Selye proposed the notion of adaptation energy and published ""Experimental evidence supporting the conception of adaptation energy"". Adaptation of an animal to different factors appears as the spending of one resource. Adaptation energy is a hypothetical extensive quantity spent for adaptation. This term causes much debate when one takes it literally, as a physical quantity, i.e. a sort of energy. The controversial points of view impede the systematic use of the notion of adaptation energy despite experimental evidence. Nevertheless, the response to many harmful factors often has general non-specific form and we suggest that the mechanisms of physiological adaptation admit a very general and nonspecific description.   We aim to demonstrate that Selye's adaptation energy is the cornerstone of the top-down approach to modelling of non-specific adaptation processes. We analyse Selye's axioms of adaptation energy together with Goldstone's modifications and propose a series of models for interpretation of these axioms. \em Adaptation energy is considered as an internal coordinate on the `dominant path' in the model of adaptation. The phenomena of `oscillating death' and `oscillating remission' are predicted on the base of the dynamical models of adaptation.

1511.01388,q-bio,"A disease that caused by dengue virus (DENV) has become the major health problem of the world. Nowadays, no effective treatment is available to overcome the disease due to the level of dengue virus pathogeneses. A novel treatment method such as antiviral drug is highly necessary for coping with the dengue disease. Envelope protein is one of the non-structural proteins of DENV, which engaged in the viral fusion process. The fusion process is mediated by the conformational change in the protein structure from dimer to trimer state. The previous research showed the existing cavity on the dimer structure of the envelope protein. The existing ligand could get into cavity of the envelope protein, stabilize the dimer structure or hamper the transition of dimer protein into trimer. In this fashion, the fusion process can be prevented. The aim of this research is designing the cyclic peptide with prolin-prolin bond as fusion inhibitor of DENV envelope protein through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. The screening of 3,883 cyclic peptides, each of them connected by prolin-prolin bond, through molecular docking resulted in five best ligands. The pharmacological and toxicity character of these five ligands were analised in silico. The result showed that PYRRP was the best ligand. PAWRP was also chosen as the best ligand because it showed good affinity with protein cavity. Stability of ligand-protein complex was analyzed by molecular dynamics simulation. The result showed that PYRRP ligand was able to support the stability of DENV envelope protein dimer structure at 310 K and 312 K.

This is in contrast with most behavioral tasks, which only provide time-sparse, delayed rewards. Here we show that a biologically plausible reward-modulated Hebbian learning algorithm, previously used in feedforward models of birdsong learning, can train recurrent networks based solely on delayed, phasic reward signals at the end of each trial. The method requires no dedicated feedback or readout networks: the whole network connectivity is subject to learning, and the network output is read from one arbitrarily chosen network cell. We use this method to successfully train a network on a delayed nonmatch to sample task (which requires memory, flexible associations, and non-linear mixed selectivities). Using decoding techniques, we show that the resulting networks exhibit dynamic coding of task-relevant information, with neural encodings of various task features fluctuating widely over the course of a trial. Furthermore, network activity moves from a stimulus-specific representation to a response-specific representation during response time, in accordance with neural recordings in behaving animals for similar tasks. We conclude that recurrent neural networks, trained with reward-modulated Hebbian learning, offer a plausible model of cortical dynamics during learning and performance of flexible association.",15,[],10
1505.02198,q-bio,"Intracellular biochemical networks fluctuate dynamically due to various internal and external sources of fluctuation. Dissecting the fluctuation into biologically relevant components is important for understanding how a cell controls and harnesses noise and how information is transferred over apparently noisy intracellular networks. While substantial theoretical and experimental advancement on the decomposition of fluctuation was achieved for feedforward networks without any loop, we still lack a theoretical basis that can consistently extend such advancement to feedback networks. The main obstacle that hampers is the circulative propagation of fluctuation by feedback loops. In order to define the relevant quantity for the impact of feedback loops for fluctuation, disentanglement of the causally interlocked influence between the components is required. In addition, we also lack an approach that enables us to infer non-perturbatively the influence of the feedback to fluctuation as the dual reporter system does in the feedforward network. In this work, we resolve these problems by extending the work on the fluctuation decomposition and the dual reporter system. For a single-loop feedback network with two components, we define feedback loop gain as the feedback efficiency that is consistent with the fluctuation decomposition for feedforward networks. Then, we clarify the relation of the feedback efficiency with the fluctuation propagation in an open-looped FF network. Finally, by extending the dual reporter system, we propose a conjugate feedback and feedforward system for estimating the feedback efficiency only from the statistics of the system non-perturbatively.",15,[],10

1507.02716,q-bio,"Chronic pain affects about 100 million adults in the US. Despite their great need, neuropharmacology and neurostimulation therapies for chronic pain have been associated with suboptimal efficacy and limited long-term success, as their mechanisms of action are unclear. Yet current computational models of pain transmission suffer from several limitations. In particular, dorsal column models do not include the fundamental underlying sensory activity traveling in these nerve fibers. We developed a (simple) simulation test bed of electrical neurostimulation of myelinated nerve fibers with underlying sensory activity. This paper reports our findings so far. Interactions between stimulation-evoked and underlying activities are mainly due to collisions of action potentials and losses of excitability due to the refractory period following an action potential. In addition, intuitively, the reliability of sensory activity decreases as the stimulation frequency increases. This first step opens the door to a better understanding of pain transmission and its modulation by neurostimulation therapies.",15,[],10

Bifurcation analysis allows for the exploration of model's dynamic behavior and the determination of these parameter regimes that result in immune-mediated tumor control.

In fact, this scheme makes the controlled amplifier significantly robust, and furthermore it realizes the minimum-noise amplification even under realistic imperfections. Hence, the presented theory enables the quantum amplification to be implemented at a practical level.

The famous paradoxes of quantum theory, the mysterious nature of measurements in quantum theory and the principal no-go theorems for hidden variables are first briefly reviewed. The Koopman-von Neumann Hilbert space theory based on complex wave functions underlying particle trajectories in classical phase space, is an important step forward in that direction. It provides a clear and beautiful harmony of classical waves and particles. Sudarshan has given an alternative but equivalent formulation that shows that classical mechanics can be regarded as a quantum theory with essentially hidden non-commuting variables. An extension of KvNS theory to classical electrodynamics provides a sound Hilbert space foundation to it and satisfactorily accounts for entanglement and Bell-CHSH-like violations already observed in classical polarization optics. An important new insight that has been obtained through these developments is that entanglement and Bell-like inequality violations are neither unique signatures of quantumness nor of non-locality---they are rather signatures of non-separability. Finally, Sudarshan's proposed solution to the measurement problem using KvNS theory for the measuring apparatus is sketched to show to what extent wave and particles can be harmonized in quantum theory.",15,[],6

1503.02269,quant-ph,"Quantum entanglement is considered, by and large, to be a very delicate and non-robust phenomenon that is very hard to maintain in the presence of noise, or non-zero temperatures. In recent years however, and motivated, in part, by a quest for a quantum analog of the PCP theorem researches have tried to establish whether or not we can preserve quantum entanglement at ""constant"" temperatures that are independent of system size. This would imply that any quantum state with energy at most, say 0.05 of the total available energy of the Hamiltonian, would be highly-entangled. To this date, no such systems were found, and moreover, it became evident that even embedding local Hamiltonians on robust, albeit ""non-physical"" topologies, namely expanders, does not guarantee entanglement robustness. In this study, we indicate that such robustness may be possible after all: We construct an infinite family of O(1)-local Hamiltonians, corresponding to check terms of a quantum error-correcting code with the following property of inapproximability: any quantum state with energy at most 0.05 w.r.t. the total available energy cannot be even approximately simulated by classical circuits of bounded (sub-logarithmic) depth. In a sense, this implies that even providing a ""witness"" to the fact that the local Hamiltonian can be ""almost"" satisfied, already requires some measure of long-range entanglement. Our construction is but a first step in what, we believe, is a whole range of possible entanglement - robust local Hamiltonians. A natural next step, we believe, is to devise such local Hamiltonians that resist approximation in terms of bounded-depth quantum circuits (e.g. NLTS), and even find such robust forms of entanglement that are useful for some computation.",15,[],6

Expressing the energy transfer through currents of excitation probability between the states in a site representation enables us to gain key insights into the energy transfer dynamics. It allows to, i) identify the pathways of energy transport in large networks of sites and to quantify their relative weights, ii) quantify the respective contributions of unitary dynamics, dephasing, and relaxation/dissipation processes to the energy transfer, and iii) quantify the contribution of coherence to the energy transfer.

1505.03708,quant-ph,"Boson Sampling is a computational task strongly believed to be hard for classical computers, but efficiently solvable by orchestrated bosonic interference in a specialised quantum computer. Current experimental schemes, however, are still insufficient for a convincing demonstration of the advantage of quantum over classical computation. A new variation of this task, Scattershot Boson Sampling, leads to an exponential increase in speed of the quantum device, using a larger number of photon sources based on parametric downconversion. This is achieved by having multiple heralded single photons being sent, shot by shot, into different random input ports of the interferometer. Here we report the first Scattershot Boson Sampling experiments, where six different photon-pair sources are coupled to integrated photonic circuits. We employ recently proposed statistical tools to analyse our experimental data, providing strong evidence that our photonic quantum simulator works as expected. This approach represents an important leap toward a convincing experimental demonstration of the quantum computational supremacy.",15,[],6
1501.00068,quant-ph,"Classical simulations of noisy stabilizer circuits are often used to estimate the threshold of a quantum error-correcting code. Physical noise sources are efficiently approximated by random insertions of Pauli operators. For a single qubit, more accurate approximations that still allow for efficient simulation can be obtained by including Clifford operators and Pauli operators conditional on measurement in the noise model. We examine the feasibility of employing these expanded error approximations to obtain better threshold estimates. We calculate the level-1 pseudothreshold for the Steane [[7,1,3]] code for amplitude damping and dephasing along a non-Clifford axis. The expanded channels estimate the actual channel action more accurately than the Pauli channels before error correction. However, after error correction, the Pauli twirling approximation yields very accurate estimates of the performance of quantum error-correcting protocols in the presence of the actual noise channel.",15,[],6
1505.06000,quant-ph,"We study the sensitivity of phase estimation using a generic class of path-symmetric entangled states equation, where an arbitrary state equation occupies one of two modes in quantum superposition. This class of states includes the previously considered states, i.e. equation states and entangled coherent states, as special cases. With its generalization, we identify the practical limit of phase estimation under energy constraint that is characterized by the photon statistics of the component state equation. We first show that quantum Cramer-Rao bound (QCRB) can be lowered with super-Poissonianity of the state equation. By introducing a component state of the form equation, we particularly show that an arbitrarily small QCRB can be achieved even with a finite energy in an ideal situation. For practical measurement schemes, we consider a parity measurement and a full photon-counting method to obtain phase-sensitivity. Without photon loss, the latter scheme employing any path-symmetric states equation achieves the QCRB over the entire range equation of unknown phase shift equation whereas the former does so in a certain confined range of equation. We find that the case of equation provides the most robust resource against loss among the considered entangled states over the whole range of input energy. Finally we also propose experimental schemes to generate these path-symmetric entangled states.",15,[],6

We find that while entanglement is a key resource within an individual Sagnac interferometer, its presence between the interferometers is a far more complicated story. The optimum level of entanglement depends strongly on the sought parameter values, and small but significant improvements may be gained from choosing states with the optimal amount of entanglement between the interferometers.",15,[],6

However, because a superconducting ring without Josephson junctions has intrinsically well-separated energy-level spacings, Josephson junctions are not necessary as long as one can achieve single-qubit operations. We show that the orbital angular momentum of light can be adopted as a qubit-control means and can eliminate the need for Josephson junctions. The feasibility study reveals that the proposed qubit has many advantages over the previous ones. The lifetime of the qubit is extended due to the lack of the junction resistance. Very fast (sub-nanosecond) qubit manipulation in both single- and two-qubit gate is achieved.

As an illustration, we show that the dynamics of a nonlinear Dirac particle can be simulated on an optical nonlinear QW platform implemented with a measurement-based-feedforward scheme. The nonlinear evolution induced by the feed-forward introduces a self-coupling mechanism to (otherwise linear) Dirac particles, which accordingly behave as a \emphsoliton. We particularly consider two kinds of nonlinear Dirac equations, one with a scalar-type self-coupling (Gross-Neveu model) and the other with a vector-type one (Thirring model), respectively. Using their known stationary solutions, we confirm that our nonlinear QW framework is capable of exhibiting characteristic features of a soliton. Furthermore, we show that the nonlinear QW enables us to observe and control an enhancement and suppression of the ballistic diffusion.",15,[],6

By exploiting the above three-photon and two-photon systems with the same parameters as the resource for the second step of our ECP, the parties can obtain a standard three-photon W state by keeping the robust odd-parity instance. Meanwhile, the systems in the even-parity instance can be used as the resource in the next round of our ECP. The success probability of our ECP is largely increased by iteration of the ECP process.

Using this observation, we introduce a state-independent definition of disturbance by relating it to the distinguishability problem between two classical statistical distributions --- one resulting from a single quantum measurement and the other from a succession of two quantum measurements. Interestingly, we find an error-disturbance trade-off relation for any measurements in two-dimensional Hilbert space and for measurements with mutually unbiased bases in any finite-dimensional Hilbert space. This relation shows that error should be reduced to zero in order to minimize the sum of error and disturbance. We conjecture that a similar trade-off relation can be generalized to any measurements in an arbitrary finite-dimensional Hilbert space.",15,[],6

1501.02733,quant-ph,"Current understanding of correlations and quantum phase transitions in many-body systems has significantly improved thanks to the recent intensive studies of their entanglement properties. In contrast, much less is known about the role of quantum non-locality in these systems. On the one hand, standard, ""theorist- and experimentalist-friendly"" many-body observables involve correlations among only few (one, two, rarely three...) particles. On the other hand, most of the available multipartite Bell inequalities involve correlations among many particles. Such correlations are notoriously hard to access theoretically, and even harder experimentally. Typically, there is no Bell inequality for many-body systems built only from low-order correlation functions. Recently, however, it has been shown in [J. Tura et al., Science 344, 1256 (2014)] that multipartite Bell inequalities constructed only from two-body correlation functions are strong enough to reveal non-locality in some many-body states, in particular those relevant for nuclear and atomic physics.

1504.07767,quant-ph,"Entanglement has been studied extensively for unveiling the mysteries of non-classical correlations between quantum systems. In the bipartite case, there are well known measures for quantifying entanglement such as concurrence, relative entropy of entanglement (REE) and negativity, which cannot be increased via local operations. It was found that for sets of non-maximally entangled states of two qubits, comparing these entanglement measures may lead to different entanglement orderings of the states. On the other hand, although it is not an entanglement measure and not monotonic under local operations, due to its ability of detecting multipartite entanglement, quantum Fisher information (QFI) has recently received an intense attraction generally with entanglement in the focus. In this work, we revisit the state ordering problem of general two qubit states. Generating a thousand random quantum states and performing an optimization based on local general rotations of each qubit, we calculate the maximal QFI for each state. We analyze the maximized QFI in comparison with concurrence, REE and negativity and obtain new state orderings.

The interplay between adiabaticity, fidelity and robustness of the resulting pulses is examined for the case of single-qubit inversion, and superadiabatic pulses are demonstrated to have improved robustness to control errors.

Through a comprehensive analysis, supported by explicit analytical calculations, we find that the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord are far from being trivial or intuitive. In this context, we find states that are indistinguishable from the point of view of entanglement and distinguishable from the point of view of quantum discord, states where the two quantifiers give opposite information and states where they give roughly the same information about correlations at a certain time. Depending on the initial conditions, this model exhibits a fascinating range of phenomena that can be used for experimental purposes such as: Robust states against change of manifold or dissipation, tunable entanglement states and states with a counterintuitive sudden birth as the number of photons increase.

We also find that for the class of two qubit states that is restricted to have only two non-zero diagonal elements such that the effective dimensionality of the two-qubit state is same as the dimensionality of the pump polarization state, the upper bound on concurrence is the degree of polarization itself, that is, equation. Our work shows that the maximum manifestation of two-particle correlations as entanglement is dictated by one-particle correlations.
