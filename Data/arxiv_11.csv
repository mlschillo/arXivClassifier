1105.2385,astro-ph,"We present a concept study on weak lensing map reconstruction through the cosmic magnification effect in galaxy number density distribution. We propose a minimal variance linear estimator to minimize both the dominant systematical and statistical errors in the map reconstruction. It utilizes the distinctively different flux dependences to separate the cosmic magnification signal from the overwhelming galaxy intrinsic clustering noise. It also minimizes the shot noise error by an optimal weighting scheme on the galaxy number density in each flux bin. Our method is in principle applicable to all galaxy surveys with reasonable redshift information. We demonstrate its applicability against the planned Square Kilometer Array survey, under simplified conditions. Weak lensing maps reconstructed through our method are complementary to that from cosmic shear and CMB and 21cm lensing. They are useful for cross checking over systematical errors in weak lensing reconstruction and for improving cosmological constraints.",11,[],1
1110.5131,astro-ph,"Candidate supernova remnants G23.50.1 and G25.50.0 were observed by XMM-Newton in the course of a snap-shot survey of plerionic and composite SNRs in the Galactic plane. In the field of G23.50.1, we detected an extended source, ~3' in diameter, which we tentatively interpret as a pulsar-wind nebula (PWN) of the middle-aged radio pulsar B1830-08. Our analysis suggests an association between PSR B1830-08 and the surrounding diffuse radio emission. If the radio emission is due to the SNR, then the pulsar must be significantly younger than its characteristic age. Alternatively, the radio emission may come from a relic PWN. In the field of G25.50.0, which contains the extended TeV source HESS J1837-069, we detected the recently discovered young high-energy pulsar J1838-0655 embedded in a PWN with extent of 1.3'. We also detected another PWN candidate (AX J1837.3-0652) with an extent of 2' and unabsorbed luminosity L(2-10 keV) ~ 4 x 1033 erg/s at d=7 kpc. The third X-ray source, located within the extent of the HESS J1837-069, has a peculiar extended radio counterpart, possibly a radio galaxy with a double nucleus or a microquasar. We did not find any evidence of the SNR emission in the G25.50.0 field. We provide detailed multiwavelength analysis and identifications of other field sources and discuss robustness of the G25.50.0 and G23.50.1 classifications as SNRs. (abstract abridged)",11,[],1
1112.5285,astro-ph,"Gamma ray bursts (GRBs) are thought to originate from highly relativistic jets. The fireball model predicts internal shocks in the jets, causing magnetic field to be amplified and particles to be accelerated. We model the effects of an asymmetric density configuration for an internal plasma collision in a quasi-parallel magnetic field. We measured electron acceleration and found that a tenuous population of electrons is accelerated to Lorentz factors of \sim 300 - close to energy equipartition with ions. We found that the filaments did not remain static, but were deflected by the Lorentz force and rolled up into small vortices, which themselves merge to form a larger current vortex.",11,[],1
1112.4614,astro-ph,The Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi LAT) provides long term systematic monitoring observations of the gamma-ray emission from blazars. The variability properties and the correlation with other wavelength bands are important clues for the evaluation of blazar models. We present results from timing and multiwavelength correlation analysis and discuss differences between blazar classes.,11,[],1
1111.2827,astro-ph,"We revisit the origin of Larson's scaling relations, which describe the structure and kinematics of molecular clouds, based on recent observations and large-scale simulations of supersonic turbulence. Using dimensional analysis, we first show that both linewidth-size and mass-size correlations observed on scales 0.1-50 pc can be explained by a simple conceptual theory of compressible turbulence without resorting to the often assumed virial equilibrium or detailed energy balance condition. The scaling laws can be consistently interpreted as a signature of supersonic turbulence with no need to invoke gravity. We then show how self-similarity of structure established by the turbulence breaks in star-forming clouds through development of gravitational instabilities in the vicinity of the sonic scale, ls~0.1 pc, leading to the formation of prestellar cores.",11,[],1
1103.5104,astro-ph,"G.V.Juggarow was one of the early pioneers of observational astronomy in India who built his own observatory in 1840 at Vizagapatnam. His legacy was continued by his son-in-law A.V.Nursing Row till 1892, his daughter till 1894, Madras Government till 1898, and his grandson till it became inactive in early 1900s. Observations of comets, planetary transits, stellar occultations etc have been continued along with meteorological observations. Celestial photography was also started at the observatory. After 1898 the observatory's activities were re-oriented towards meteorology. The establishment of the observatory, the personalities involved and the final closing of the institution are described here.",11,[],1
1102.5366,astro-ph,"We report the results of a new survey of massive, OB stars throughout the Carina Nebula using the X-ray point source catalog provided by the Chandra Carina Complex Project (CCCP) in conjunction with infrared (IR) photometry from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey and the Spitzer Space Telescope Vela--Carina survey. Mid-IR photometry is relatively unaffected by extinction, hence it provides strong constraints on the luminosities of OB stars, assuming that their association with the Carina Nebula, and hence their distance, is confirmed. We fit model stellar atmospheres to the optical (UBV) and IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 182 OB stars with known spectral types and measure the bolometric luminosity and extinction for each star. We find that the extinction law measured toward the OB stars has two components: Av=1--1.5 mag produced by foreground dust with a ratio of total-to-selective absorption Rv=3.1 plus a contribution from local dust with Rv>4.0 in the Carina molecular clouds that increases as Av increases. Using X-ray emission as a strong indicator of association with Carina, we identify 94 candidate OB stars with Lbol\geq104 Lsun by fitting their IR SEDs. If the candidate OB stars are eventually confirmed by follow-up spectroscopic observations, the number of cataloged OB stars in the Carina Nebula will increase by ~50%. Correcting for incompleteness due to OB stars falling below the Lbol cutoff or the CCCP detection limit, these results potentially double the size of the young massive stellar population.",11,[],1
1103.5464,astro-ph,"We present observations and dynamical models of the stellar nuclear clusters (NCs) at the centres of NGC 4244 and M33. We then compare these to an extensive set of simulations testing the importance of purely stellar dynamical mergers on the formation and growth of NCs. Mergers of star clusters are able to produce a wide variety of observed properties, including densities, structural scaling relations, shapes (including the presence of young discs) and even rapid rotation. Nonetheless, difficulties remain, most notably that the second order kinematic moment Vrms = (V2  sigma2)(1/2) of the models is too centrally peaked to match observations. This can be remedied by the merger of star clusters onto a pre-existing nuclear disc, but the line-of-sight velocity V is still more slowly rising than in NGC 4244. Our results therefore suggest that purely stellar dynamical mergers cannot form NCs, and that gas dissipation is a necessary ingredient for at least ~50% of a NC's mass. The negative vertical anisotropy found in NGC 4244 however requires at least 10% of the mass to be accreted as stars, since gas dissipation and in situ star formation leads to positive vertical anisotropy.",11,[],1
1101.2626,astro-ph,"We present CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) maps of the interacting barred LINER/Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 3627 obtained with the IRAM interferometer at resolutions of 2.1"" x 1.3"" and 0.9"" x 0.6"", respectively. The molecular gas emission shows a nuclear peak, an elongated bar-like structure of ~18"" (~900 pc) diameter in both CO maps and, in CO(1-0), a two-arm spiral feature from r~9"" (~450 pc) to r~16"" (~800 pc). The inner ~18"" bar-like structure, with a north/south orientation (PA = 14\deg), forms two peaks at the extremes of this elongated emission region. The kinematics of the inner molecular gas shows signatures of non-circular motions associated both with the 18"" bar-like structure and the spiral feature detected beyond it. The 1.6 micron H-band 2MASS image of NGC 3627 shows a stellar bar with a PA = -21\deg, different from the PA (= 14\deg) of the CO bar-like structure, indicating that the gas is leading the stellar bar. The torques computed with the HST-NICMOS F160W image and our PdBI maps are negative down to the resolution limit of our images, ~60 pc in CO(2-1). If the bar ends at ~3 kpc, coincident with corotation (CR), the torques are negative between the CR of the bar and the nucleus, down to the resolution limit of our observations. This scenario is compatible with a recently-formed rapidly rotating bar which has had insufficient time to slow down because of secular evolution, and thus has not yet formed an inner Lindblad resonance (ILR). The presence of molecular gas inside the CR of the primary bar, where we expect that the ILR will form, makes NGC 3627 a potential smoking gun of inner gas inflow. The gas is fueling the central region, and in a second step could fuel directly the active nucleus.",11,[],1
1110.1034,astro-ph,"We present a new, simple method to predict activity-induced radial velocity variations using high-precision time-series photometry. It is based on insights from a simple spot model, has only two free parameters (one of which can be estimated from the light curve) and does not require knowledge of the stellar rotation period. We test the method on simulated data and illustrate its performance by applying it to MOST/SOPHIE observations of the planet host-star HD189733, where it gives almost identical results to much more sophisticated, but highly degenerate models, and synthetic data for the Sun, where we demonstrate that it can reproduce variations well below the m/s level. We also apply it to Quarter 1 data for Kepler transit candidate host stars, where it can be used to estimate RV variations down to the 2-3m/s level, and show that RV amplitudes above that level may be expected for approximately two thirds of the candidates we examined.",11,[],1
1106.0727,astro-ph,"One of the FLRW models that best fits the WMAP sky maps of the CMB is the Poincare dodecahedral space. The optimal fit of this model to WMAP data was recently found using an optimal cross-correlation method, but the systematic error in the estimate of the matched-circle angular radius \alpha, or equivalently, the (comoving) size of the Universe 2\rinj (twice the injectivity radius), might be much higher than the random error. In order to increase the falsifiability of the model, it would be useful to reduce the uncertainty in this estimate and to estimate the fraction of the sky where multiply imaged gravitationally bound objects should potentially be detectable. ""Matched discs"" are defined in order to describe a useful subset of multiply imaged objects. The cross-correlation method at \ltapprox 1 \hGpc is applied to WMAP 7-year data in order to improve the estimate of \alpha. The improved matched-circle radius estimate is \alpha = 23  1.4 deg, where the uncertainty represents systematic error dependent on the choices of galactic mask and all-sky map. This is equivalent to 2\rinj = 18.2 0.5 \hGpc for matter density parameter Omegam=0.28 0.02. The lowest redshift of multiply imaged objects is z=10618. Multiply imaged high overdensity (rare) peaks visible during 200>z>106 should be present in matched discs of radius 14.82.3 deg. The accuracy in the matched circle radius estimate is considerably improved by using the higher resolution signal. The predicted matched discs (over 200>z>106) project to about 20% of the full sky. Since any object located exactly in the discs would be multiply imaged at equal redshifts, evolutionary effects would be small for objects that are nearly located in the discs.",11,['gr-qc'],1
1107.4282,astro-ph,"The CLEAN algorithm, widely used in radio interferometry for the deconvolution of radio images, performs well only if the raw radio image (dirty image) is, to good approximation, a simple convolution between the instrumental point-spread function (dirty beam) and the true distribution of emission across the sky. An important case in which this approximation breaks down is during frequency synthesis if the observing bandwidth is wide enough for variations in the spectrum of the sky to become significant. The convolution assumption also breaks down, in any situation but snapshot observations, if sources in the field vary significantly in flux density over the duration of the observation. Such time-variation can even be instrumental in nature, for example due to jitter or rotation of the primary beam pattern on the sky during an observation. An algorithm already exists for dealing with the spectral variation encountered in wide-band frequency synthesis interferometry. This algorithm is an extension of CLEAN in which, at each iteration, a set of N `dirty beams' are fitted and subtracted in parallel, instead of just a single dirty beam as in standard CLEAN. In the wide-band algorithm the beams are obtained by expanding a nominal source spectrum in a Taylor series, each term of the series generating one of the beams. In the present paper this algorithm is extended to images which contain sources which vary over both frequency and time. Different expansion schemes (or bases) on the time and frequency axes are compared, and issues such as Gibbs ringing and non-orthogonality are discussed. It is shown that practical considerations make it often desirable to orthogonalize the set of beams before commencing the cleaning. This is easily accomplished via a Gram-Schmidt technique.",11,[],1
1110.0653,astro-ph,"A recent study of the accretion efficiency of the PG sample AGN, based on the thin accretion disk emission model, finds the accretion radiative efficiency is correlated with the black hole mass (eta Mbh0.5). A followup study suggests the correlation is an artifact induced by selection effects. Here we point out there are two independent effects. The first is a sample selection effect, which leads to a high L/LEdd AGN sample. The second effect is the observed small spread in the SED shape, which is not induced by selection effects. The second effect is what leads to the eta Mbh0.5 relation in the PG sample. The physical reason for the small spread in the SED shape is an intriguing open question.",11,[],1
1102.5097,astro-ph,"For over a decade, it has been debated whether the concordance LCDM model is consistent with the observed abundance of giant arcs in clusters. While previous theoretical studies have focused on properties of the lens and source populations, as well as cosmological effects such as dark energy, the impact of initial conditions on the giant-arc abundance is relatively unexplored. Here, we quantify the impact of non-Gaussian initial conditions with the local bispectrum shape on the predicted frequency of giant arcs. Using a path-integral formulation of the excursion set formalism, we extend a semi-analytic model for calculating halo concentrations to the case of primordial non-Gaussianity, which may be useful for applications outside of this work. We find that massive halos tend to collapse earlier in models with positive fNL, relative to the Gaussian case, leading to enhanced concentration parameters. The converse is true for fNL < 0. In addition to these effects, which change the lensing cross sections, non-Gaussianity also modifies the abundance of supercritical clusters available for lensing. These combined effects work together to either enhance (fNL > 0) or suppress (fNL < 0) the probability of giant-arc formation. Using the best value and 95% confidence levels currently available from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, we find that the giant-arc optical depth for sources at zs~2 is enhanced by ~20% and ~45% for fNL = 32 and 74 respectively. In contrast, we calculate a suppression of ~5% for fNL = -10. These differences translate to similar relative changes in the predicted all-sky number of giant arcs.",11,[],1
1111.2152,astro-ph,"We propose a statistical method for decomposition of contributions to iron production from various sources: supernovae Type II and the subpopulations of supernovae Type Ia -- prompt (their progenitors are short-lived stars of ages less then equation100 Myr) and tardy (whose progenitors are long-lived stars of ages equation100 Myr). To do that, we develop a theory of oxygen and iron synthesis which takes into account the influence of spiral arms on amount of the above elements synthesized by both the supernovae Type II and prompt supernovae Ia. We solve this task without of any preliminary suppositions about the ratio among the portions of iron synthesized by the above sources.   The relative portion of iron synthesized by tardy supernovae Ia for the life-time of the Galaxy is equation35 per cent (in the present ISM this portion is equation50 per cent). Correspondingly, the total portion of iron supplied to the disc by supernovae Type II and prompt supernovae Ia is equation65 per cent (in the present ISM this portion is equation50 per cent).   The above result slightly depends on the adopted mass of oxygen and iron synthesized during one explosion of supernovae and the shape (bimodal or smooth) of the so-called Delay Time Distribution function.   The portions of iron mass distributed between the short-lived supernovae are usually as follows: depending on the ejected masses of oxygen or iron during one supernovae Type II event the relative portion of iron, supplied to the Galactic disc for its age, varies in the range 12 - 32 per cent (in the present ISM 9-25 per cent); the portion supplied by prompt supernovae Ia to the Galactic disc is 33 - 53 per cent (in ISM 26 - 42 per cent).",11,[],1
1111.0504,astro-ph,"The bulk of air showers initiated by very high energy cosmic rays exhibits a longitudinal development in depth with a single well-defined shower maximum. However, a small fraction of showers has a profile that differs considerably from this average behaviour. In extreme cases, such anomalous longitudinal profiles can even have two distinct shower maxima. We discuss the properties of the primary interactions that lead to such profiles. Simulations are used to estimate the rate of anomalous profiles in dependence of primary energy, mass, and characteristic features of hadronic multiparticle production at very high energies.",11,[],1
1106.0197,astro-ph,"Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are some of the most enigmatic X-ray bright sources known to date. It is generally accepted that they cannot host black holes as large as those associated with active galaxies, but they appear to be significantly more luminous than their better understood Galactic X-ray binary (XRB) cousins, while displaying an intriguing combination of differences and similarities with them. Through studying large, representative samples of these sources we may hope to enhance our understanding of them. To this end, we derive a large catalogue of 650 X-ray detections of 470 ULX candidates, located in 238 nearby galaxies, by cross correlating the 2XMM Serendipitous Survey with the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies. The presented dedicated catalogue offers a significant improvement over those previously published both in terms of number and the contribution of background contaminants, e.g. distant quasars, which we estimate to be at most 24 per cent, but more likely ~17 per cent. To undertake population studies, we define a `complete' sub-sample of sources compiled from observations of galaxies with sensitivity limits below 1039 erg/s. The luminosity function of this sample is consistent with a simple power-law. Although we do not find any statistical requirement for a high luminosity cut-off, as has been reported previously, we are not able to rule out its presence. Also, we find that the number of ULXs per unit galaxy mass decreases with increasing galaxy mass for ULXs associated with spiral galaxies, in broad agreement with previous results, but is consistent with being constant with galaxy mass for sources associated with elliptical galaxies.",11,[],1
1107.2198,astro-ph,"High sensitivity observations of radio halos in galaxy clusters at frequencies lower than 330 MHz are still relatively rare, and very little is known compared to the classical 1.4 GHz images. The few radio halos imaged down to 150-240 MHz show a considerable spread in size, morphology and spectral properties. All clusters belonging to the GMRT Radio Halo Survey with detected or candidate cluster-scale diffuse emission have been imaged at 325 MHz with the GMRT. Few of them were also observed with the GMRT at 240 MHz and 150 MHz. For A1682, imaging is particularly challenging due to the presence of strong and extended radio galaxies at the center. Our data analysis suggests that the radio galaxies are superposed to very low surface brightness radio emission extended on the cluster scale, which we present here.",11,[],1
1112.4827,astro-ph,"In this paper we report on the broadband X-ray properties of a complete sample of 33 absorbed Seyfert galaxies hard X-ray selected with integral. The high quality broadband spectra obtained with both xmm, and integral-IBIS data are well reproduced with an absorbed primary emission with a high energy cutoff and its scattered fraction below 2-3 keV, plus the Compton reflection features. A high energy cut-off is found in 30% of the sample, with an average value below 150 keV. The diagnostic plot NH vs Fobs(2-10 keV)/F(20-100 keV) allowed the isolation of the Compton thick objects, and may represent a useful tool for future hard X-ray observations of newly discovered AGN. We are unable to associate the reflection components with the absorbing gas as a torus, a more complex scenario being necessary. In the Compton thin sources, a fraction (but not all) of the Fe K line needs to be produced in a gas possibly associated with the optical Broad Line Region, responsible also for the absorption. We still need a Compton thick medium (not intercepting the line of sight) likely associated to a torus, which contributes to the Fe line intensity and produces the observed reflection continuum above 10 keV. The so-called Iwasawa-Taniguchi effect can not be confirmed with our data. Finally, the comparison with a sample of unobscured AGN shows that, type 1 and type 2 (once corrected for absorption) Seyfert are characterized by the same nuclear/accretion properties (luminosity, bolometric luminosity, Eddington ratio), supporting the ""unified"" view.",11,[],1
1106.1869,astro-ph,"We study the interaction of a proto-planetary disk and a planet on a highly inclined orbit in the linear regime. The evolution of the planet is dominated by dynamical friction for planet masses above several Earth-masses. Smaller planets are dominated by aerodynamic drag, especially for very high inclinations and retrograde orbits.   The time-scales associated with migration and inclination damping are calculated. For certain values of the inclination, the inclination damping time-scale is longer than the migration time-scale and the disk lifetime. This result shows that highly inclined planets can not (re-)align with the proto-planetary disk.   We discuss the dependence of numerical simulations on the gravitational softening parameter. We find only a logarithmic dependence, making global three dimensional simulations of this process computationally feasible.   A large fraction of Hot Jupiters is on highly inclined orbits with respect to the rotation axis of the star. On the other hand small-mass planetary systems discovered by the Kepler mission have low mutual inclinations. This shows that there are two distinct formation mechanisms at work. The process that creates inclined Hot Jupiters does not operate on small mass planets because the damping timescales are so long that these systems would still be inclined today.",11,[],1
1102.0652,astro-ph,"We are carrying out a detailed 2D spectroscopic study of the central 210 pc X 130 pc of the blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxy NGC5253. This contribution presents the ionization conditions and chemical abundance patterns for the different kinematic components of the ionized gas detected in our previous work. All the kinematic components present an excess in nitrogen abundance. In particular, the broad velocity component has larger excess than the narrow one by a factor of ~1.4-0.4 which is consistent with a scenario for the Giant HII Region where the broad component of the emission lines traces the material expelled by the two central Super Star Clusters while the narrow one is associated to previously existing ionized gas.",11,[],1
1104.0681,astro-ph,"We present Keck/LRIS-B spectra for a sample of ten AEGIS X-ray AGN host galaxies and thirteen post-starburst galaxies from SDSS and DEEP2 at 0.2<z<0.8 in order to investigate the presence, properties, and influence of outflowing galactic winds at intermediate redshifts. We focus on galaxies that either host a low-luminosity AGN or have recently had their star formation quenched to test whether these galaxies have winds of sufficient velocity to potentially clear gas from the galaxy. We find, using absorption features of Fe II, Mg II, and Mg I, that six of the ten (60%) X-ray AGN host galaxies and four of the thirteen (31%) post-starburst galaxies have outflowing galactic winds, with typical velocities of ~200 km/s. We additionally find that most of the galaxies in our sample show line emission, possibly from the wind, in either Fe II* or Mg II. A total of 100% of our X-ray AGN host sample (including four red sequence galaxies) and 77% of our post-starburst sample has either blueshifted absorption or line emission. Several KA galaxies have small amounts of cool gas absorption at the systemic velocity, indicating that not all of the cool gas has been expelled. We conclude that while outflowing galactic winds are common in both X-ray low-luminosity AGN host galaxies and post-starburst galaxies at intermediate redshifts, the winds are likely driven by supernovae (as opposed to AGN) and do not appear to have sufficiently high velocities to quench star formation in these galaxies.",11,[],1
1111.4936,astro-ph,"We performed a uniform and detailed analysis of 1112 high-resolution spectra of FGK dwarfs obtained with the HARPS spectrograph at the ESO 3.6 m telescope (La Silla, Chile). Most stars have effective temperatures 4700 K < Teff < 6300 K and lie in the metallicity range of -1.39 < [Fe/H] < 0.55. Our main goal is to investigate whether there are any differences between the elemental abundance trends (especially [alpha/Fe] ratio) for stars of different subpopulations. The equivalent widths of spectral lines are automatically measured from HARPS spectra with the ARES code. The abundances of three alpha elements are determined using a differential LTE analysis relative to the Sun, with the 2010 revised version of the spectral synthesis code MOOG and a grid of Kurucz ATLAS9 atmospheres.The stars of our sample fall into two populations, clearly separated in terms of [alpha/Fe] up to super-solar metallicities. In turn, high-alpha stars are also separated into two families with a gap in both [alpha/Fe] ([alpha/Fe] = 0.17) and metallicity ([Fe/H] = -0.2) distributions. The metal-poor high-alpha stars (thick disk) and metal-rich high-alpha stars are on average older than chemically defined thin disk stars (low-alpha stars). The two alpha-enhanced families have different kinematics and orbital parameters. The metal-rich alpha-enhanced stars, such as thin disk stars have nearly circular orbits, close to the Galactic plane. We put forward the idea that these stars may have been formed in the inner Galactic disk, but their exact nature still remains to be clarified.",11,[],1
1105.5125,astro-ph,"We report results of a sensitive Chandra ACIS-S observation of the classical T Tauri star RY Tau. Previous studies have shown that it drives a spectacular bipolar jet whose blueshifted component is traced optically along P.A. approximately 295 degrees at separations of 1.5 - 31 arcseconds from the star. Complex X-ray emission is revealed, including a very soft non-variable spectral component (some of which may originate in shocks), a superhot flaring component (T >= 100 MK), and faint extended structure near the star. The structure is visible in deconvolved images and extends northwestward out to a separation of 1.7 arcseconds, overlapping the inner part of the optical jet. Image analysis suggests that most of the extension is real, but some contamination by PSF-induced structure within the central arcsecond may be present. The predicted temperature for a shock-heated jet based on jet speed and shock speed estimates from optical measurements is too low to explain the extended X-ray structure. Either higher speed material within the jet has escaped optical detection or other mechanisms besides shock-heating are involved. Alternative mechanisms that could produce higher temperature plasma at small offsets to the northwest of RY Tau include magnetic heating in the jet, hot plasmoids ejected at high speeds, or X-ray emission from a putative close companion whose presence has been inferred from Hipparcos variations.",11,[],1
1103.2622,astro-ph,"Context: The interaction of plasma motions and magnetic fields is an important mechanism, which drives solar activity in all its facets. For example, photospheric flows are responsible for the advection of magnetic flux, the redistribution of flux during the decay of sunspots, and the built-up of magnetic shear in flaring active regions. Aims: Systematic studies based on G-band data from the Japanese Hinode mission provide the means to gather statistical properties of horizontal flow fields. This facilitates comparative studies of solar features, e.g., G-band bright points, magnetic knots, pores, and sunspots at various stages of evolution and in distinct magnetic environments, thus, enhancing our understanding of the dynamic Sun. Methods: We adapted Local Correlation Tracking (LCT) to measure horizontal flow fields based on G-band images obtained with the Solar Optical Telescope on board Hinode. In total about 200 time-series with a duration between 1-16 h and a cadence between 15-90 s were analyzed. Selecting both a high-cadence (dt = 15 s) and a long-duration (dT = 16 h) time-series enabled us to optimize and validate the LCT input parameters, hence, ensuring a robust, reliable, uniform, and accurate processing of a huge data volume. Results: The LCT algorithm produces best results for G-band images having a cadence of 60-90 s. If the cadence is lower, the velocity of slowly moving features will not be reliably detected. If the cadence is higher, the scene on the Sun will have evolved too much to bear any resemblance with the earlier situation. Consequently, in both instances horizontal proper motions are underestimated. The most reliable and yet detailed flow maps are produced using a Gaussian kernel with a size of 2560 km x 2560 km and a full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of 1200 km (corresponding to the size of a typical granule) as sampling window.",11,[],1
1103.0357,astro-ph,"Ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) have several types according to dominance of starburst or AGN component. We made stellar population analysis for a sample of 160 ULIRGs to study the evolution of ULIRGs. We found that the dominance of intermediate-age and old stellar populations increases along the sequence of HII-like ULIRGs, Seyfert-HII composite ULIRGs, and Seyfert 2 ULIRGs. Consequently the typical mean stellar age and the stellar mass increase along the sequence. Comparing the gas mass estimated from the CO measurements with the stellar mass estimated from the optical spectra, we found that gas fraction is anti-correlated with the stellar mass. HII-like ULIRGs with small stellar masses do not possess enough gas and the total mass, and therefore have no evolution connections with massive Seyfert 2 ULIRGs. Only massive ULIRGs may follow the evolution sequence toward AGNs, and massive HII-like ULIRGs are probably in an earlier stage of the sequence.",11,[],1
1111.5617,astro-ph,"Core accretion and disk instability have traditionally been regarded as the two competing possible paths of planet formation. In recent years, evidence have accumulated in favor of core accretion as the dominant mode, at least for close-in planets. However, it might be hypothesized that a significant population of wide planets formed by disk instabilities could exist at large separations, forming an invisible majority. In previous work, we addressed this issue through a direct imaging survey of B2--A0-type stars, and concluded that <30% of such stars form and retain planets and brown dwarfs through disk instability, leaving core accretion as the likely dominant mechanism. In this paper, we extend this analysis to FGKM-type stars by applying a similar analysis to the Gemini Deep Planet Survey (GDPS) sample. The results strengthen the conclusion that substellar companions formed and retained around their parent stars by disk instabilities are rare. Specifically, we find that the frequency of such companions is <8% for FGKM-type stars under our most conservative assumptions, for an outer disk radius of 300 AU, at 99% confidence. Furthermore, we find that the frequency is always <10% at 99% confidence independently of outer disk radius, for any radius from 5 to 500 AU. We also simulate migration at a wide range of rates, and find that the conclusions hold even if the companions move substantially after formation. Hence, core accretion remains the likely dominant formation mechanism for the total planet population, for every type of star from M-type through B-type.",11,[],1
1104.2801,astro-ph,"We investigate the peculiar properties of a large TeV gamma-ray flare from Mrk~501 detected during the 2009 multiwavelength campaign. We identify the counterpart of the flare in the Fermi/LAT telescope data and study its spectral and timing characteristics. A strong order-of-magnitude increase of the very-high-energy gamma-ray flux during the flare was not accompanied by an increase in the X-ray flux, so that the flare was one of the ""orphan""-type TeV flares observed in BL Lacs. The flare lasted about 1 month at energies above 10 GeV. The flaring source spectrum in the 10-200 GeV range was very hard, with a photon index 1.1/-0.2, harder than that observed in any other blazar in the gamma-ray band. No simultaneous flaring activity was detected below 10 GeV. Different variability properties of the emission below and above 10 GeV indicate the existence of two separate components in the spectrum. We investigate possible explanations of the very hard flaring component. We consider, among others, the possibility that the flare is produced by an electromagnetic cascade initiated by very-high-energy gamma-rays in the intergalactic medium. Within such an interpretation, peculiar spectral and temporal characteristics of the flare could be explained if the magnetic field in the intergalactic medium is of the order of 1e-17 - 1e-16 G.",11,[],1
1107.3872,astro-ph,"Using a vector vortex coronagraph behind the 1.5-m well-corrected subaperture (WCS) at Palomar, we detected a second object very close to letter Cephei, a letter Scuti F0 IV star. The candidate companion, ~50 times fainter than letter Cephei, if physically associated, is a late-type K or early M star, and lies at an angular separation of 330 mas, or 1.1 letter/D for the WCS, making it the smallest angle detection ever realized with a coronagraph in terms of letter/D units. The projected separation of the putative companion is ~8.6 AU, most likely on a highly eccentric orbit. The recently detected near-infrared excess is thus likely not due to hot dust. Moreover, we also show that the previously reported IRAS 60 letter m excess was due to source confusion on the galactic plane.",11,[],1
1102.1500,astro-ph,"It is now clear that a subset of supernovae display evidence for jets and are observed as gamma-ray bursts. The angular momentum distribution of massive stellar endpoints provides a rare means of constraining the nature of the central engine in core-collapse explosions. Unlike supermassive black holes, the spin of stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems is little affected by accretion, and accurately reflects the spin set at birth. A modest number of stellar-mass black hole angular momenta have now been measured using two independent X-ray spectroscopic techniques. In contrast, rotation-powered pulsars spin-down over time, via magnetic braking, but a modest number of natal spin periods have now been estimated. For both canonical and extreme neutron star parameters, statistical tests strongly suggest that the angular momentum distributions of black holes and neutron stars are markedly different. Within the context of prevalent models for core-collapse supernovae, the angular momentum distributions are consistent with black holes typically being produced in GRB-like supernovae with jets, and with neutron stars typically being produced in supernovae with too little angular momentum to produce jets via magnetohydrodynamic processes. It is possible that neutron stars are imbued with high spin initially, and rapidly spun-down shortly after the supernova event, but the available mechanisms may be inconsistent with some observed pulsar properties.",11,[],1
1107.5449,astro-ph,"In this paper we consider the possibility that the structure of the largest radio galaxy J1420-0545 is formed by a restarted rather than a primary jet activity. This hypothesis is motivated by the unusual morphological properties of the source, suggesting almost ballistic propagation of powerful jets in a particularly low-density environment. New radio observations of J1420-0545 confirm its morphology consisting of only two narrow lobes; no trace of any outer low-density cavity due to the previous jet activity is therefore detected. Different model fits performed using the newly accessed radio data imply relatively young age of the source, its exceptionally high expansion velocity, large jet kinetic power, and confirm particularly low-density environment. We find that it is possible to choose a realistic set of the model parameters for which the hypothetical outer lobes of J1420-0545 are old enough so that their expected radio surface brightness is substantially below the rms noise level of the available radio maps. On the other hand, the extremely low density of the gas surrounding the J1420-0545 lobes is consistent with the mean density of the baryonic matter in the Universe. This suggests that the source may be instead located in a real void of the galaxy and matter distribution. In both cases the giant radio lobes of J1420-0545 are expected to modify substantially the surrounding matter by driving strong shocks and heating the gas located at the outskirts of the filamentary galactic distribution. Finally, we also find that the energetic requirements for the source are severe in terms of the total jet power and the total energy deposited by the outflows far away from the central engine.",11,[],1
1106.5943,astro-ph,"Black holes exceeding a billion solar masses have been detected at redshifts greater than six. The rapid formation of these objects may suggest a massive early seed or a period of growth faster than Eddington. Here we suggest a new mechanism along these lines. We propose that in the process of hierarchical structure assembly, dense star clusters can be contracted on dynamical time scales due to the nearly free-fall inflow of self-gravitating gas with a mass comparable to or larger than that of the clusters. This increases the velocity dispersion to the point that the few remaining hard binaries can no longer effectively heat the cluster, and the cluster goes into a period of homologous core collapse. The cluster core can then reach a central density high enough for fast mergers of stellar-mass black holes and hence the rapid production of a black hole seed that could be equation or larger.",11,[],1

The project is based on 1 hour of natural-seeing observations per target, and Adaptive Optics (AO) follow-up for a major part of the sample, which includes 30 galaxies selected from the zCOSMOS/VIMOS spectroscopic survey. This first paper presents the sample selection, and the global physical characterization of the target galaxies from multicolor photometry, i.e., star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, age, etc. The Halpha integrated properties such as, flux, velocity dispersion, and size, are derived from the natural-seeing observations, while the follow up AO observations will be presented in the next paper of this series. Our sample appears to be well representative of star-forming galaxies at z~2, covering a wide range in mass and SFR. The Halpha integrated properties of the 25 Halpha detected galaxies are similar to those of other IFS samples at the same redshifts. Good agreement is found among the SFRs derived from Halpha luminosity and other diagnostic methods, provided the extinction affecting the Halpha luminosity is about twice that affecting the continuum. A preliminary kinematic analysis, based on the maximum observed velocity difference across the source, and on the integrated velocity dispersion, indicates that the sample splits nearly 50-50 into rotation-dominated and velocity dispersion-dominated galaxies, in good agreement with previous surveys.",11,[],1
1101.1553,astro-ph,"We assess the most plausible scenarios for generating large amounts of dust in high-z quasars (QSOs) on the basis of observationally derived physical properties of QSOs at z > 6. We use a chemical evolution model to compute the temporal progression of quantities, such as the amount of dust and gas, stellar masses, star formation rates (SFRs) and the metallicity for various combinations of the initial mass function (IMF), the mass of the galaxy, dust production efficiencies, and the degree of dust destruction in the ISM. We investigate the influence of the SFR on the evolution of these quantities, and determine the earliest epochs at which agreement with observations can be achieved. We apply the obtained results to individual QSOs at z > 6. We find that large quantities of dust can be generated rapidly as early as 30 Myr after the onset of the starburst when the SFR of the starburst is > 103 Msun yr(-1). The amount of dust and several other physical quantities of individual QSOs at z > 6 are satisfactorily reproduced by models at epochs 30, 70, 100, and 170 Myr for galaxies with initial gas masses of 1-3 x 1011 Msun. The best agreement with observations is obtained with top-heavy IMFs. A sizable dust contribution from supernovae (SNe) is however required, while at these epochs dust production by asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars is negligible. Moderate dust destruction in the ISM can be accommodated.",11,[],1

We have fit the radio and gamma-ray light curves of 19 LAT-detected MSPs in the context of geometric, outer-magnetospheric emission models assuming the retarded vacuum dipole magnetic field using a Markov chain Monte Carlo maximum likelihood technique. We find that, in many cases, the models are able to reproduce the observed light curves well and provide constraints on the viewing geometries that are in agreement with those from radio polarization measurements. Additionally, for some MSPs we constrain the altitudes of both the gamma-ray and radio emission regions. The best-fit magnetic inclination angles are found to cover a broader range than those of non-recycled gamma-ray pulsars.",11,[],1

We are covering the luminosity range of 9.1042 - 2.1043 erg/s in comoving volumes of ~ 4.105 and 4.3.105 Mpc3.

1109.1830,astro-ph,"This paper presents the results from the first wide and deep dual narrow-band survey to select H-alpha (Ha) and [OII] line emitters at z=1.47-0.02 (using matched narrow-band filters in the H and z' bands), exploiting synergies between the UKIRT and Subaru telescopes. The Ha survey at z=1.47 reaches a flux limit of ~7x10-17 erg/s/cm2 and detects ~200 Ha emitters over 0.7deg2, while the much deeper [OII] survey reaches an effective flux of ~7x10-18 erg/s/cm2, detecting ~1400 z=1.47 [OII] emitters in a matched co-moving volume of ~2.5x105 Mpc3. The combined survey results in the identification of 190 simultaneous Ha and [OII] emitters at z=1.47. Ha and [OII] luminosity functions are derived and both are shown to evolve significantly from z~0 in a consistent way. The star formation rate density of the Universe at z=1.47 is evaluated, with the Ha analysis yielding 0.16-0.05 Msun/yr/Mpc3 and the [OII] analysis 0.17-0.04 Msun/yr/Mpc3. The measurements are combined with other studies, providing a self-consistent measurement of the star formation history of the Universe over the last ~11Gyrs. By using a large comparison sample at z~0.1 (from the SDSS), [OII]/Ha line ratios are calibrated as probes of dust-extinction. Ha emitters at z~1.47 show on average 1 mag of extinction at Ha, similar to the SDSS sources at z~0. Although we find that dust extinction correlates with SFR, the relation evolves by about ~0.5 mag from z~1.5 to z~0, with z~0 relations over-predicting the dust extinction corrections at high-z by that amount. Stellar mass is found to be a much more fundamental extinction predictor, with the relation between mass and extinction being valid at both z~0 and z~1.5. Dust extinction corrections as a function of optical colours are also derived, offering simpler mechanisms for estimating extinction in moderately star-forming systems over the last ~9Gyrs [Abridged].",11,[],1

The sample comprises ~ 1600 X-ray clusters with redshifts up to ~ 1 and spans a wide range in X-ray luminosity. The SZ signal is extracted for each object individually, and the statistical significance of the measurement is maximised by averaging the SZ signal in bins of X-ray luminosity, total mass, or redshift. The SZ signal is detected at very high significance over more than two decades in X-ray luminosity (1043 erg/s < L500 E(z)-7/3 < 2 X 1045 erg/s). The relation between intrinsic SZ signal and X-ray luminosity is investigated and the measured SZ signal is compared to values predicted from X-ray data. Planck measurements and X-ray based predictions are found to be in excellent agreement over the whole explored luminosity range. No significant deviation from standard evolution of the scaling relations is detected. For the first time the intrinsic scatter in the scaling relation between SZ signal and X-ray luminosity is measured and found to be consistent with the one in the luminosity -- mass relation from X-ray studies. There is no evidence of any deficit in SZ signal strength in Planck data relative to expectations from the X-ray properties of clusters, underlining the robustness and consistency of our overall view of intra-cluster medium properties.",11,[],1
1106.0530,astro-ph,"Whether the phenomenology governing MHD turbulence is Kolmogorov or Iroshnikov-Kraichnan (IK) remains an open question, theoretically as well as observationally. The ion heating profile observed in the solar wind provides a quantitative, if indirect, observational constraint on the relevant phenomenology. Recently, a solar wind heating model based on Kolmogorov spectral scaling has produced reasonably good agreement with observations, provided the effect of turbulence generation due to pickup ions is included in the model. Without including the pickup ion contributions, the Kolmogorov scaling predicts a proton temperature profile that decays too rapidly beyond a radial distance of 15 AU. In the present study, we alter the heating model by applying an energy cascade rate based on IK scaling, and show that the model yields higher proton temperatures, within the range of observations, with or without the inclusion of the effect due to pickup ions. Furthermore, the turbulence correlation length based on IK scaling seems to follow the trend of observations better.",11,['physics'],1
1105.4461,astro-ph,Landauer's principle and the Holographic principle are used to derive the holographic information energy contribution to the Universe. Information energy density has increased with star formation until sufficient to start accelerating the expansion of the universe. The resulting reduction in the rate of star formation due to the accelerated expansion may provide a feedback that limits the information energy density to a constant level. The characteristics of the universe's holographic information energy then closely match those required to explain dark energy and also answer the cosmic coincidence problem. Furthermore the era of acceleration will be clearly limited in time.,11,[],1
1110.0726,astro-ph,"Star formation is one of the most important processes in galaxy formation.

Their luminosities decrease by a factor of three from face-on to edge-on (axis ratio limit = 0.17) orientations.

1107.3451,astro-ph,"The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) was launched in February 2010 and is now providing an unprecedented view of the solar activity at high spatial resolution and high cadence covering a broad range of temperature layers of the atmosphere. We aim at defining the structure of a polar crown cavity and describing its evolution during the erupting process. We use high cadence time series of SDO/AIA observations at 304\AA (50000 K) and 171\AA (0.6 MK) to determine the structure of the polar crown cavity and its associated plasma as well as the evolution of the cavity during the different phases of the eruption. We report on the observations recorded on 13 June 2010 located on the North-West limb. We observe coronal plasma shaped by magnetic field lines with a negative curvature (U-shape) sitting at the bottom of a cavity. The cavity is located just above the polar crown filament material. We thus observe the inner part of the cavity above the filament as depicted in the classical three part Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) model composed of a filament, a cavity and a CME front. The filament (in this case a polar crown filament) is part of the cavity and makes a continuous structuring from the filament to the CME front depicted by concentric ellipses (in a 2D cartoon). We propose to define a polar crown cavity as a density depletion sitting above denser polar crown filament plasma drained down the cavity due to gravity. As part of the polar crown filament, plasma at different temperatures (ranging from 50000K to 0.6 MK) is observed at the same location on the cavity dips and sustained by a competition between the gravity and the curvature of magnetic field lines. The eruption of the polar crown cavity as a solid body can be decomposed into two phases: a slow rise at a speed of 0.6 km/s, and an acceleration phase at a mean speed of 25 km/s.",11,[],1
1102.1971,astro-ph,"We present a new near-infrared photometric system for detection of water ice and methane ice in the solar system. The system consists of two medium-band filters in the K-band region of the near-infrared, which are sensitive to water ice and methane ice, plus continuum observations in the J-band and Y-band. The primary purpose of this system is to distinguish between three basic types of Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) --- those rich in water ice, those rich in methane ice, and those with little absorbance. In this work, we present proof-of-concept observations of 51 KBOs using our filter system, 21 of which have never been observed in the near-IR spectroscopically. We show that our custom photometric system is consistent with previous spectroscopic observations while reducing telescope observing time by a factor of 3. We use our filters to identify Haumea collisional family members, which are thought to be collisional remnants of a much larger body and are characterized by large fractions of water ice on their surfaces. We add 2009 YE7 to the Haumea collisional family based on our water ice band observations(J-H2O = -1.03 /- 0.27) which indicate a high amount of water ice absorption, our calculated proper orbital elements, and the neutral optical colors we measured, V-R = 0.38 /- 0.04, which are all consistent with the rest of the Haumea family. We identify several objects dynamically similar to Haumea as being distinct from the Haumea family as they do not have water ice on their surfaces. In addition, we find that only the largest KBOs have methane ice, and we find that Haumea itself has significantly less water ice absorption than the smaller Haumea family members. We find no evidence for other families in the Kuiper Belt.",11,[],1

The Hequation/FUV intensity ratio increases in general with the Hequation intensity and the FUV hardness ratio (1370-1520\AA\ to 1560-1710\AA), implying that late OB stars may be the main source of the Hequation recombination line at high latitudes. The variation of the Hequation intensity as a function of the Galactic latitude is also very similar to that of the FUV intensity. The results likely suggest that not only the original radiation sources of the Hequation and FUV backgrounds but also the radiative transfer mechanisms responsible for the diffuse backgrounds are largely common. Therefore, we propose a scenario wherein the Hequation background at high latitudes is mostly composed of two components, Hequation photons produced by in-situ recombination at the ionized regions around late OB stars and dust-scattered light of the Hequation photons originating from late OB stars.",11,[],1
1112.0786,astro-ph,"Astrophysical sources of TeV gamma rays are usually established by Cherenkov telescope observations. These counting type instruments have a field of view of few degrees in diameter and record large numbers of particle air showers via their Cherenkov radiation in the atmosphere. The showers are either induced by gamma rays or diffuse cosmic ray background. The commonly used test statistic to evaluate a possible gamma-ray excess is Li and Ma (1983), Eq. 17, which can be applied to independent on- and off-source observations, or scenarios that can be approximated as such. This formula however is unsuitable if the data are taken in so-called ""wobble"" mode (pointing to several offset positions around the source), if at the same time the acceptance shape is irregular or even depends on operating parameters such as the pointing direction or telescope multiplicity. To provide a robust test statistic in such cases, this paper explores a possible generalization of the likelihood ratio concept on which the formula of Li and Ma is based. In doing so, the multi-pointing nature of the data and the typically known instrument point spread function are fully exploited to derive a new, semi-numerical test statistic. Due to its flexibility and robustness against systematic uncertainties, it is not only useful for detection purposes, but also for skymapping and source shape fitting. Simplified Monte Carlo simulations are presented to verify the results, and several applications and further generalizations of the concept are discussed.",11,[],1
1111.0162,astro-ph,"Although diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) could be simulated by some well-established models, the assumption of the injection rate from the thermal particles to the superthermal population is still a contentious problem. But in the self-consistent Monte Carlo simulations, because of the prescribed scattering law instead of the assumption of the injected function, hence particle injection rate is intrinsically defined by the prescribed scattering law. We expect to examine the correlation of the energy injection with the prescribed multiple scattering angular distributions. According to the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions, the energy injection and the losses in the simulation system can directly decide the shock energy spectrum slope. By the simulations performed with multiple scattering law in the dynamical Monte Carlo model, the energy injection and energy loss functions are obtained. As results, the case applying anisotropic scattering law produce a small energy injection and large energy losses leading to a soft shock energy spectrum, the case applying isotropic scattering law produce a large energy injection and small energy losses leading to a hard shock energy spectrum.",11,[],1
1102.3464,astro-ph,"We investigate the effects of AGN feedback on the colour evolution of galaxies found in local (z<0.2) groups and clusters. Galaxies located within the lobes of powerful Fanaroff-Riley type II (edge-brightened) sources show much redder colours than neighbouring galaxies that are not spatially coincident with the radio source. By contrast, no similar effect is seen near Fanaroff-Riley type I (core-dominated) radio sources. We show that these colours are consistent with FR-IIs truncating star formation as the expanding bow shock overruns a galaxy. We examine a sample of clusters with no detectable radio emission and show that galaxy colours in these clusters carry an imprint of past AGN feedback. AGN activity in the low-redshift Universe is predominantly driven by low-luminosity radio sources with short duty cycles. Our results show that, despite their rarity, feedback from powerful radio sources is an important driver of galaxy evolution even in the local volume.",11,[],1
1111.4037,astro-ph,"We report on the rare eruption of a miniature Halpha filament that took a surge form. The filament first underwent a full development within 46 minutes and then began to erupt 9 minutes later, followed by a compact, impulsive X-ray class M2.2 flare with a two ribbon nature only at the early eruption phase. During the eruption, its top rose, whereas the two legs remained rooted in the chromosphere and swelled little perpendicular to the rising direction. This led to a surge-like eruption with a narrow angular extent. Similar to the recent observations for standard and blowout X-ray jets by Moore et al., we thus define it as a ""blowout Halpha surge"". Furthermore, our observations showed that the eruption was associated with (1) a coronal mass ejection guided by a preexisting streamer, (2) abrupt, significant, and persistent changes in the photospheric magnetic field around the filament, and (3) sudden disappearance of a small pore. These observations thus provide evidence that blowout surge is a small-scale version of large-scale filament eruption in many aspects. Our observations further suggest that at least part of Halpha surges belong to blowout-type ones, and exact distinction between standard and blowout Halpha surges is important in understanding their different origins and associated eruptive phenomena.",11,[],1
1107.1769,astro-ph,"We employ a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction technique, for the first time to study the kinematics of six coronal mass ejections (CMEs), using images obtained from the COR1 and COR2 coronagraphs on board the twin STEREO spacecraft, as also the eruptive prominences (EPs) associated with three of them using images from the Extreme UltraViolet Imager (EUVI). A feature in the EPs and leading edges (LEs) of all the CMEs was identified and tracked in images from the two spacecraft, and a stereoscopic reconstruction technique was used to determine the 3D coordinates of these features. True velocity and acceleration were determined from the temporal evolution of the true height of the CME features. Our study of kinematics of the CMEs in 3D reveals that the CME leading edge undergoes maximum acceleration typically below 2Requation. The acceleration profiles of CMEs associated with flares and prominences exhibit different behaviour. While the CMEs not associated with prominences show a bimodal acceleration profile, those associated with prominences do not. Two of the three associated prominences in the study show a high and rising value of acceleration up to a distance of almost 4Requation but acceleration of the corresponding CME LE does not show the same behaviour, suggesting that the two may not be always driven by the same mechanism. One of the CMEs, although associated with a C-class flare showed unusually high acceleration of over 1500 m sequation. Our results therefore suggest that only the flare-associated CMEs undergo residual acceleration, which indicates that the flux injection theoretical model holds good for the flare-associated CMEs, but a different mechanism should be considered for EP-associated CMEs.",11,[],1
1112.5479,astro-ph,"Dark matter-dominated cluster-scale halos act as an important cosmological probe and provide a key testing ground for structure formation theory. Focusing on their mass profiles, we have carried out (gravity-only) simulations of the concordance LCDM cosmology, covering a mass range of 2.1012-2.1015 solar mass/h and a redshift range of z=0-2, while satisfying the associated requirements of resolution and statistical control. When fitting to the Navarro-Frenk-White profile, our concentration-mass (c-M) relation differs in normalization and shape in comparison to previous studies that have limited statistics in the upper end of the mass range. We show that the flattening of the c-M relation with redshift is naturally expressed if c is viewed as a function of the peak height parameter, letter. Unlike the c-M relation, the slope of the c-letter relation is effectively constant over the redshift range z=0-2, while the amplitude varies by ~30% for massive clusters. This relation is, however, not universal: Using a simulation suite covering the allowed wCDM parameter space, we show that the c-letter relation varies by about /- 20% as cosmological parameters are varied. At fixed mass, the c(M) distribution is well-fit by a Gaussian with letterc/c = 0.33, independent of the radius at which the concentration is defined, the halo dynamical state, and the underlying cosmology. We compare the LCDM predictions with observations of halo concentrations from strong lensing, weak lensing, galaxy kinematics, and X-ray data, finding good agreement for massive clusters (M > 4.1014 solar mass/h), but with some disagreements at lower masses. Because of uncertainty in observational systematics and modeling of baryonic physics, the significance of these discrepancies remains unclear.",11,[],1

We analyzed the X-ray spectra of a Seyfert 1 galaxy, Mrk 704, which was observed twice, three years apart, by XMM-Newton. The spectra were well fitted with a two zones absorber, possibly covering only partially the source. The parameters of the absorbing matter - column density, ionization state, covering factor - changed significantly between the two observations. Possible explanations for the more ionized absorber are a torus wind (the source is a polar scattering one) or, in the partial covering scenario, an accretion disk wind.

We find that, within r500, the evolution of the ICM mass--total mass relation is consistent with the expectation of self-similar model, while there is no evidence for redshift evolution in the stellar mass--total mass relation.

1112.3850,astro-ph,"The most popular method for determining coronal temperatures is the scale-height-method (shm). It is based on electron density profiles inferred from White Light (WL) brightness measurements of the corona during solar eclipses. This method has been applied to several published coronal electron density models. The calculated temperature distributions reach a maximum at r > 1.3 RS, and therefore do not satisfy one of the conditions for applying the shm method. Another method is the hydrostatic equilibrium method (hst), which enables coronal temperature distributions to be determined, providing solutions to the hydrostatic equilibrium equation. The temperature maximas using the hst method are almost equal to those obtained using the shm method, but the temperature peak is always at significantly lower altitude when the hst-method is used than when the shm-method is used. A third and more recently developed method, dyn, can be used for the same published electron density profiles. The temperature distributions obtained using the dyn method are regular solutions of the hydrodynamic equations. They depend on the expansion velocity of the coronal plasma considered as a free input parameter in the calculations. At the base of the solar corona, where the coronal bulk velocity is small (subsonic), the dyn and hst methods give similar temperature values. Larger differences are found at higher altitudes where the expansion velocity approaches and exceeds the velocity of sound. This paper shows also the effects of the flow tube geometry and ion temperatures on the electron temperature distributions. The dyn method is a generalization of the hst method, where the electron temperature distribution tends to zero at infinite radial distances. It is a new diagnostic tool for determining from WL coronal observations the range of radial distances where the coronal heating rate is at its maximum.",11,['physics'],1
1103.1606,astro-ph,"The Chandra Carina Complex Project (CCCP) has shown that the Carina Nebula displays bright, spatially-complex soft diffuse X-ray emission. Here we `sum up' the CCCP diffuse emission work by comparing the global morphology and spectrum of Carina's diffuse X-ray emission to other famous sites of massive star formation with pronounced diffuse X-ray emission: M17, NGC 3576, NGC 3603, and 30 Doradus. All spectral models require at least two diffuse thermal plasma components to achieve adequate spectral fits, a softer component with kT = 0.2--0.6 keV and a harder component with kT = 0.5--0.9 keV. In several cases these hot plasmas appear to be in a state of non-equilibrium ionization that may indicate recent and current strong shocks. A cavity north of the embedded giant HII region NGC 3576 is the only region studied here that exhibits hard diffuse X-ray emission; this emission appears to be nonthermal and is likely due to a recent cavity supernova, as evidenced by a previously-known pulsar and newly-discovered pulsar wind nebula also seen in this cavity. All of these targets exhibit X-ray emission lines that are not well-modeled by variable-abundance thermal plasmas and that might be attributed to charge exchange at the shock between the hot, tenuous, X-ray-emitting plasma and cold, dense molecular material; this is likely evidence for dust destruction at the many hot/cold interfaces that characterize massive star-forming regions.",11,[],1

1105.4065,astro-ph,"Improving upon our purely dynamical work, we present three-dimensional simulations of the atmospheric circulation on Earth-like (exo)planets and hot Jupiters using the GFDL-Princeton Flexible Modeling System (FMS). As the first steps away from the dynamical benchmarks of Heng, Menou & Phillipps (2011), we add dual-band radiative transfer and dry convective adjustment schemes to our computational setup. Our treatment of radiative transfer assumes stellar irradiation to peak at a wavelength shorter than and distinct from that at which the exoplanet re-emits radiation (""shortwave"" versus ""longwave""), and also uses a two-stream approximation. Convection is mimicked by adjusting unstable lapse rates to the dry adiabat. The bottom of the atmosphere is bounded by a uniform slab with a finite thermal inertia. For our models of hot Jupiters, we include an analytical formalism for calculating temperature-pressure profiles, in radiative equilibrium, which accounts for the effect of collision-induced absorption via a single parameter. We discuss our results within the context of: the predicted temperature-pressure profiles and the absence/presence of a temperature inversion; the possible maintenance, via atmospheric circulation, of the putative high-altitude, shortwave absorber expected to produce these inversions; the angular/temporal offset of the hot spot from the substellar point, its robustness to our ignorance of hyperviscosity and hence its utility in distinguishing between different hot Jovian atmospheres; and various zonal-mean flow quantities. Our work bridges the gap between three-dimensional simulations which are purely dynamical and those which incorporate multi-band radiative transfer, thus contributing to the construction of a required hierarchy of three-dimensional theoretical models.",11,['physics'],1
1105.2837,astro-ph,"Throughout the last 20 years 7 supernovae (SNe) have been discovered within Arp 299. One of these is unclassified, leaving 6 core-collapse events; 2 type II, 2 type Ib, a type IIb and one object of indistinct type; Ib/IIb. We analyse the relative numbers of these types, together with their positions with respect to host galaxy properties, to investigate implications for both progenitor characteristics and star formation (SF) properties. Our findings are: 1) the ratio of 'stripped envelope' (SE) events to other type II is higher than that found in the local Universe. 2) All SE SNe are more centrally concentrated within the system than the other type II. 3) All SN environments have similar metallicities and there are no significant metallicity gradients across the system. 4) The SE SNe all fall on bright SF regions while the other type II are found to occur away from bright HII regions. We draw two different -but non-mutually exclusive- interpretations on the system and its supernovae: 1) The distribution of SNe, and the relatively high fraction of types Ib and IIb events over other type II can be explained by the young age of the most recent SF in the system, where insufficient time has expired for the observed to match the 'true' relative SN rates. This explanation provides additional independent evidence that both types Ib and IIb SNe arise from progenitors of shorter stellar lifetime and hence higher mass than other type II. 2) Given the assumption that types Ib and IIb trace higher mass progenitor stars, the relatively high frequency of types Ib and IIb to other type II, and also the centralisation of the former over the latter with respect to host galaxy light implies that in the centrally peaked and enhanced SF within this system, the initial mass function is biased towards the production of high mass stars.",11,[],1
1106.3602,astro-ph,"We present integral field spectroscopy of two selected zones in the Orion Nebula obtained with the Potsdam Multi-Aperture Spectrophotometer (PMAS), covering the optical spectral range from 3500 to 7200 A and with a spatial resolution of 1"". The observed zones are located on the prominent Bright Bar and on the brightest area at the northeast of the Orion South cloud, both containing remarkable ionization fronts. We obtain maps of emission line fluxes and ratios, electron density and temperatures, and chemical abundances. We study the ionization structure and morphology of both fields, which ionization fronts show different inclination angles with respect to the plane of the sky. We find that the maps of electron density, O/H and O/H ratios show a rather similar structure. We interpret this as produced by the strong dependence on density of the [OII] lines used to derive the O abundance, and that our nominal values of electron density-derived from the [SII] line ratio-may be slightly higher than the appropriate value for the O zone. We measure the faint recombination lines of OII in the field at the northeast of the Orion South cloud allowing us to explore the so-called abundance discrepancy problem. We find a rather constant abundance discrepancy across the field and a mean value similar to that determined in other areas of the Orion Nebula, indicating that the particular physical conditions of this ionization front do not contribute to this discrepancy.",11,[],1

Considering the Fractal universe with a small inhomogeneity in the mass distribution in the early universe, the variation of the fine structure constant have been investigated between matter and radiation dominated era.

It is argued that the uncertainty about the true H/He EOS in a pressure regime where the gravitational moments J2 and J4 are most sensitive, i.e. between 0.5 and 4 Mbar, is in part responsible for the broad range Mcore=0-18 Mearth, MZ=0-38 Mearth, and McoreMZ=14-38 Mearth currently offered for Jupiter.

We derive an accurate relative calibration for the effective area of the RGS, derive an accurate absolute wavelength calibration, improve the method for adding time-dependent spectra and enhance the efficiency of the spectral fitting by two orders of magnitude.

1105.4795,astro-ph,"The origin of the narrow optical emission bands seen toward the Red Rectangle is not yet understood. In this paper we investigate further the proposal that these are due to luminescence of large carbonaceous molecules. Polarised signals of several percent could be expected from certain asymmetric molecular rotators. The ESPaDOnS echelle spectrograph mounted at the CFHT was used to obtain high-resolution optical spectropolarimetric data of the Red Rectangle nebular emission. The RRBs at 5800, 5850, and 6615 Angstrom are detected in spectra of the nebular emission 7"" and 13"" North-East from the central star. The 5826 and 6635 Angstrom RRB are detected only at the position nearest to the central star. For both positions the Stokes Q and U spectra show no unambiguous polarisation signal in any of the RRBs. We derive an upper limit of 0.02% line polarisation for these RRBs. A tentative feature with peak polarisation of 0.05% is seen for the 5800 RRB at 7"" offset. However, the Null spectra suggest that this may be an instrumental artifact. The lack of a clear polarisation signal for the five detected RRBs implies that, if the emission is due to luminescence of complex organics, these gas-phase molecular carriers are likely to have a high degree of symmetry, as they do not exhibit a Q-branch in their rotational profile, although this may be modified by statistical effects.",11,[],1
1107.5606,astro-ph,"[ABRIDGED] Based on high-resolution (R~42000 to 48000) and high signal-to-noise (S/N~50 to 150) spectra obtained with UVES/VLT, we present detailed elemental abundances (O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, Y, and Ba) and stellar ages for 26 microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars in the Galactic bulge. The analysis is based on equivalent width measurements and standard 1-D LTE MARCS model stellar atmospheres. We also present NLTE Li abundances based on line synthesis of the 7Li line at 670.8 nm. We show that the bulge metallicity distribution (MDF) is double-peaked; one peak at [Fe/H]= -0.6 and one at [Fe/H]=0.3, and with a dearth of stars around solar metallicity. This is in contrast to the MDF derived from red giants in Baade's window, which peaks at this exact value. A simple significance test shows that it is extremely unlikely to have such a gap in the microlensed dwarf star MDF if the dwarf stars are drawn from the giant star MDF. To resolve this issue we discuss several possibilities, but we can not settle on a conclusive solution for the observed differences. We further find that the metal-poor bulge dwarf stars are predominantly old with ages greater than 10\,Gyr, while the metal-rich bulge dwarf stars show a wide range of ages. The metal-poor bulge sample is very similar to the Galactic thick disk in terms of average metallicity, elemental abundance trends, and stellar ages. Speculatively, the metal-rich bulge population might be the manifestation of the inner thin disk. If so, the two bulge populations could support the recent findings, based on kinematics, that there are no signatures of a classical bulge and that the Milky Way is a pure-disk galaxy. Also, recent claims of a flat IMF in the bulge based on the MDF of giant stars may have to be revised based on the MDF and abundance trends probed by our microlensed dwarf stars.",11,[],1

We construct power spectrum density of pulse frequencies and find that fluctuations in the pulse frequency derivatives are consistent with the random walk model with a noise strength of equation Hz sequation. From the X-ray spectral analysis of \emphRXTE-PCA observations, we find that Hydrogen column density is variable over the binary orbit, tending to increase just after the periastron passage. We also show that the X-ray spectrum gets hardened with decreasing X-ray flux. We discuss pulse-to-pulse variability of the source near dipping ingress and egress.

1107.5488,astro-ph,"SGR 04185729 is a transient Soft Gamma-ray Repeater which underwent a major outburst in June 2009, during which the emission of short bursts was observed. Its properties appeared quite typical of other sources of the same class until long-term X-ray monitoring failed to detect any period derivative. The present upper limit on equation implies that the surface dipole field is equation (Rea et al 2010), well below those measured in other Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGRs) and in the Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs), a group of similar sources. Both SGRs and AXPs are currently believed to be powered by ultra-magnetized neutron stars (magnetars, equation--equation). SGR 04185729 hardly seems to fit in such a picture. We show that the magneto-rotational properties of SGR 04185729 can be reproduced if this is an aged magnetar, equation old, which experienced substantial field decay. The large initial toroidal component of the internal field required to match the observed properties of SGR 04185729 ensures that crustal fractures, and hence bursting activity, can still occur at present time. The thermal spectrum observed during the outburst decay is compatible with the predictions of a resonant compton scattering model (as in other SGRs/AXPs) if the field is low and the magnetospheric twist moderate.",11,[],1
1104.0300,astro-ph,"Based on the database compiled in the first article of this series, with 56 SN events discovered in 3838 galaxies of the southern hemisphere, we compute the rate of supernovae (SNe) of different types along the Hubble sequence normalized to the optical and near-infrared luminosities as well as to the stellar mass of the galaxies. We find that the rates of all SN types show a dependence on both morphology and colors of the galaxies, and therefore, on the star-formation activity. The rate of core-collapse (CC) SNe is confirmed to be closely related to the Star Formation Rate (SFR) and only indirectly to the total mass of the galaxies. The rate of SNe Ia can be explained by assuming that at least 15% of Ia events in spiral galaxies originates in relatively young stellar populations. We find that the rates show no modulation with nuclear activity or environment. The ratio of SN rates between types Ib/c and II shows no trend with spiral type.",11,[],1

1110.5065,astro-ph,"The basic cosmological distances are linked by the Etherington cosmic distance duality relation, equation, where equation and equation are, respectively, the luminosity and angular diameter distances. In order to test its validity, some authors have proposed phenomenological expressions for equation thereby deforming the original Etherington's relation and comparing the resulting expressions with the available and future cosmological data. The relevance of such studies is unquestionable since any violation of the cosmic distance duality relation could be the signal of new physics or non-negligible astrophysical effects in the usually assumed perfectly transparent Universe. In this letter, we show that under certain conditions such expressions can be derived from a more fundamental approach with the parameters appearing in the equation expression defining the cosmic absorption parameter as recently discussed by Chen and Kantowski. Explicit examples involving four different parametrizations of the deformation function are given. Based on such an approach, it is also found that the latest Supernova data can also be explained in the framework of a pure cold dark matter model (Einstein-de Sitter). Two different scenarios with cosmic absorption are discussed. Only if the cosmic opacity is fully negligible, the description of an accelerating Universe powered by dark energy or some alternative gravity theory must be invoked.",11,"['gr-qc', 'hep-th']",1
1108.0545,astro-ph,"Spectral features can arise by reflection of coronal X-rays on a black hole accretion disc. The resulting profile bears various imprints of strong gravitational field acting on the light emitting gas. The observed shape of the reflection line is formed by integrating contributions over a range of radii across the accretion disc plane, where the individual photons experience different level of energy shifts, boosting, and amplification by relativistic effects. These have to be convolved with the intrinsic emissivity of the line, which is a function of radius and the emission angle in the local frame. We study if the currently discussed instruments on-board X-ray satellites will be able to reveal the departure of the line radial emissivity from a simple smooth power-law function, which is often assumed in data fitting and interpretation. Such a departure can be a result of excess emission occurring at a certain distance. This could be used to study variations with radius of the line production or to constrain the position of the inner edge of the accretion disc. By simulating artificial data from a bright active galactic nucleus of a type-1 Seyfert galaxy (inclination ~ 30 deg, X-ray flux 1-2 mCrab in keV energy band) we show that the required sensitivity and energy resolution could be reached with Large Area Detector of the proposed LOFT mission.

1110.6320,astro-ph,"We examine the fraction of early-type (and spiral) galaxies found in groups and clusters of galaxies as a function of dark matter halo mass. We use morphological classifications from the Galaxy Zoo project matched to halo masses from both the C4 cluster catalogue and the Yang et al (2007) group catalogue. We find that the fraction of early-type (or spiral) galaxies remains constant (changing by less than 10%) over three orders of magnitude in halo mass (13<log MH/Msol/h<15.8). This result is insensitive to our choice of halo mass measure, from velocity dispersions or summed optical luminosity. Furthermore, we consider the morphology-halo mass relations in bins of galaxy stellar mass M*, and find that while the trend of constant fraction remains unchanged, the early-type fraction amongst the most massive galaxies (11<log M*/Msol/h <12) is a factor of three greater than lower mass galaxies (10<logM*/Msol/h<10.7). We compare our observational results with those of simulations presented in De Lucia et al (2011), as well as previous observational analyses, and semi-analytic bulge (or disc) dominated galaxies from the Millennium Simulation. We find the simulations recover similar trends as observed, but may over-predict the abundances of the most massive bulge dominated (early-type) galaxies. Our results suggest that most morphological transformation is happening on the group scale before groups merge into massive clusters. However, we show that within each halo a morphology-density relation remains: it is summing the total fraction to a self-similar scaled radius which results in a flat morphology-halo mass relationship.",11,[],1
1109.5871,astro-ph,"Observations of giant radio halos provide unambiguous evidence for the existence of cosmic ray (CR) electrons and magnetic fields in galaxy clusters. The physical mechanism generating radio halos is still heavily debated. We critically discuss the proposed models for the radio halo emission and highlight the weaknesses underlying each explanation. We present an idea how the interplay of CR propagation and turbulent advection selects a bimodal spatial CR distribution that is characteristic for the dynamical state of a cluster. As a result, strongly turbulent, merging clusters should have a more centrally concentrated CR energy density profile with respect to relaxed ones with very subsonic turbulence. This translates into a bimodality of the expected diffuse radio and gamma ray emission of clusters. Thus, the observed bimodality of cluster radio halos appears to be a natural consequence of the interplay of CR transport processes, independent of the model of radio halo formation, be it hadronic interactions of CR protons or re-acceleration of low-energy CR electrons.",11,[],1

This volume-limited sample contains 12 dSph/dE, 5 dwarf spiral, 28 dI, 12 transition, and 3 tidal dwarf galaxies. From the best fit SFHs we find three significant results: (1) the average dwarf galaxy formed >50% of its stars by z~2 and 60% of its stars by z~1, regardless of current morphological type; (2) the mean SFHs of dIs, dTrans, and dSphs are similar over most of cosmic time, with the clearest differences appearing during the most recent 1 Gyr; and (3) the mean values are inconsistent with simple SFH models, e.g., exponentially declining SFRs. The mean SFHs are in general agreement with the cosmic SFH, although we observe offsets near z~1 that could be evidence that low mass systems experienced delayed star formation relative to more massive galaxies. The sample shows a strong density-morphology relationship, such that the dSphs are less isolated than dIs. We find that the transition from a gas-rich to gas-poor galaxy cannot be solely due to internal mechanisms such as stellar feedback, and instead is likely the result of external mechanisms, e.g., ram pressure and tidal forces. The average transition dwarf is slightly less isolated and less gas-rich than the typical dI. Further, the transition dwarfs can be divided into two groups: interacting and gas-poor or isolated and gas-rich, suggesting two possible evolutionary pathways.",11,[],1

Because of the different renormalization factors of each 3d orbital, the DMFT gives considerably reduced electrical anisotropy compared to the DFT results, which explains the unusually small anisotropic resistivity and superconducting property observed in the iron-based superconductors.

Mossbauer spectra taken in three geometric arrangements show that the magnetic moments are almost constrained in the film plane for the film deposited with applied magnetic field.

By changing the chemical potential, a continuous transition is found from the Mott phase to a superfluid phase without breaking the translational symmetry. For an insulating CDW state, adding particles to it gives rise to a continuous transition to a supersolid phase, while removing particles usually leads to a first-order one to either supersolid or superfluid phase. By tuning the nearest neighbor interaction, one can realize the transition between two insulating phases, Mott and CDW with the same particle density, which turns out to be of the first-order.

1104.3907,cond-mat,"As a viable candidate for an all-carbon post-CMOS electronics revolution, epitaxial graphene has attracted significant attention. To realize its application potential, reliable methods for fabricating large-area single-crystalline graphene domains are required. A new way to synthesize high quality epitaxial graphene, namely ""face-to-face"" method, has been reported in this paper. The structure and morphologies of the samples are characterized by low-energy electron diffraction, atomic force microscopy, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy.

We studied suspended samples of bilayer graphene, annealed so that it achieves very high quasiparticle mobilities. Bilayer graphene is a truly two-dimensional material with complex chiral electronic spectra and the high quality of our samples allowed us to observe strong spectrum reconstructions and electron topological transitions that can be attributed to a nematic phase transition and a decrease in rotational symmetry. These results are especially surprising because no interaction effects have been observed so far in bilayer graphene in the absence of an applied magnetic field.",11,[],8
1111.4033,cond-mat,"The two-dimensional Potts model can be studied either in terms of the original Q-component spins, or in the geometrical reformulation via Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) clusters. While the FK representation makes sense for arbitrary real values of Q by construction, it was only shown very recently that the spin representation can be promoted to the same level of generality. In this paper we show how to define the Potts model in terms of observables that simultaneously keep track of the spin and FK degrees of freedom. This is first done algebraically in terms of a transfer matrix that couples three different representations of a partition algebra. Using this, one can study correlation functions involving any given number of propagating spin clusters with prescribed colours, each of which contains any given number of distinct FK clusters. For 0 <= Q <= 4 the corresponding critical exponents are all of the Kac form hr,s, with integer indices r,s that we determine exactly both in the bulk and in the boundary versions of the problem. In particular, we find that the set of points where an FK cluster touches the hull of its surrounding spin cluster has fractal dimension d2,1 = 2 - 2 h2,1. If one constrains this set to points where the neighbouring spin cluster extends to infinity, we show that the dimension becomes d1,3 = 2 - 2 h1,3. Our results are supported by extensive transfer matrix and Monte Carlo computations.",11,"['math-ph', 'math']",8
1105.3804,cond-mat,"The theoretical description of photoemission spectra of transition metals was greatly improved recently by accounting for the correlations between the d electrons within the local spin density approximation (LSDA) plus dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). We assess the improvement of the LSDADMFT over the plain LSDA in x-ray absorption spectroscopy, which --- unlike the photoemission spectroscopy --- is probing unocccupied electronic states. By investigating the L2,3-edge x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) of Fe, Co, and Ni, we find that the LSDADMFT improves the LSDA results, in particular concerning the asymmetry of the L3 white line. Differences with respect to the experiment, nevertheless, remain --- particularly concerning the ratio of the intensities of the L3 and L2 peaks. The changes in the XMCD peak intensities invoked by the use of the LSDADMFT are a consequence of the improved description of the orbital polarization and are consistent with the XMCD sum rules. Accounting for the core hole within the final state approximation does not generally improve the results. This indicates that to get more accurate L2,3-edge XANES and XMCD spectra, one has to treat the core hole beyond the final state approximation.",11,[],8

1112.1808,cond-mat,"The interplay between spin transport and thermoelectricity offers several novel ways of generating, manipulating, and detecting nonequilibrium spin in a wide range of materials. Here we formulate a phenomenological model in the spirit of the standard model of electrical spin injection to describe the electronic mechanism coupling charge, spin, and heat transport and employ the model to analyze several different geometries containing ferromagnetic (F) and nonmagnetic (N) regions: F, F/N, and F/N/F junctions which are subject to thermal gradients. We present analytical formulas for the spin accumulation and spin current profiles in those junctions that are valid for both tunnel and transparent (as well as intermediate) contacts. For F/N junctions we calculate the thermal spin injection efficiency and the spin accumulation induced nonequilibrium thermopower. We find conditions for countering thermal spin effects in the N region with electrical spin injection. This compensating effect should be particularly useful for distinguishing electronic from other mechanisms of spin injection by thermal gradients. For F/N/F junctions we analyze the differences in the nonequilibrium thermopower (and chemical potentials) for parallel and antiparallel orientations of the F magnetizations, as evidence and a quantitative measure of the spin accumulation in N.

Such contacts make possible injection of evanescent wavefunctions from ZGNRs, so that their overlap within the molecular region generates a peak in the electronic transmission. Additionally, the spatial symmetry properties of the transverse propagating states in the ZGNR electrodes suppress hole-like contributions to the thermopower. Thus optimized thermopower, together with diminished phonon conductance through a ZGNR/molecule/ZGNR inhomogeneous structure, yields the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT~0.5 at room temperature and 0.5<ZT<2.5 below liquid nitrogen temperature. The reliance on evanescent mode transport and symmetry of propagating states in the electrodes makes the electronic-transport-determined power factor in this class of devices largely insensitive to the type of sufficiently short conjugated organic molecule, which we demonstrate by showing that both 18-annulene and C10 molecule sandwiched by the two ZGNR electrodes yield similar thermopower. Thus, one can search for molecules that will further reduce the phonon thermal conductance (in the denominator of ZT) while keeping the electronic power factor (in the nominator of ZT) optimized. We also show how often employed Brenner empirical interatomic potential for hydrocarbon systems fails to describe phonon transport in our single-molecule nanojunctions when contrasted with first-principles results obtained via NEGF-DFT methodology.",11,[],8

This provides a systematic derivation from first principles of effective Langevin descriptions discussed in the literature. We apply our approach to the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process, to variants with an overall constraint on the total particle number and to a two-species exclusion model.

By monitoring perturbations of the resonator's 5.44 GHz resonant frequency, we have measured the spectrum, lifetime (equation), Rabi, and Ramsey oscillations of the CPB at the charge degeneracy point while the CPB was detuned by up to 2.5 GHz . We find a maximum lifetime of the CPB was equations for equation to 4.5 GHz. Our measured equation's are consistent with loss due to coupling to the transmission line, spurious microwave circuit resonances, and a background decay rate on the order of equation sequation of unknown origin, implying that the loss tangent in the AlOequation junction barrier must be less than about equation at 4.5 GHz, about 4 orders of magnitude less than reported in larger area Al/AlOequation/Al tunnel junctions.",11,['quant-ph'],8

1104.2235,cond-mat,"The dynamical behavior of a nonlinear micromechanical resonator acting as one of the mirrors in an optical resonance cavity is investigated. The mechanical motion is coupled to the optical power circulating inside the cavity both directly through the radiation pressure and indirectly through heating that gives rise to a frequency shift in the mechanical resonance and to thermal deformation. The the energy stored in the optical cavity is assumed to follow the mirror displacement without any lag. In contrast, a finite thermal relaxation rate introduces retardation effects into the mechanical equation of motion through temperature dependent terms. Using standard averaging and harmonic balance techniques, slow envelope evolution equations are derived. In the limit of small mechanical vibrations, the micromechanical system can be described as a nonlinear Duffing-like oscillator. Coupling to the optical cavity is shown to introduce corrections to the linear dissipation, the nonlinear dissipation and the nonlinear elastic constants of the micromechanical mirror. The magnitude and the sign of these corrections depend on the exact position of the mirror and on the optical power incident on the cavity. In particular, the effective linear dissipation can become negative, causing self-sustained mechanical oscillations to occur. The full slow envelope evolution equations are used to derive the amplitudes and the corresponding oscillation frequencies of different limit cycles, and the bifurcation behavior is analyzed in detail. Finally, the theoretical results are compared to numerical simulations using realistic values of different physical parameters, showing a very good correspondence.",11,[],8

Significant GW quasiparticle corrections of more than 1.0 eV to the Kohn-Sham band gaps from the local density approximation (LDA) calculations are found. The GW self-energy corrections transform the SiC sheet from a indirect LDA band gap to a direct band gap material. Furthermore, the quasiparticle band gaps of SiC-NTs with different chiralities behave very differently as a function of tube diameter, and this can be attributed to the difference in the curvature-induced orbital rehybridization between the different chiral nanotubes. The calculated optical absorption spectra are dominated by discrete exciton peaks due to exciton states with large binding energy up to 2.0 eV in the SiC sheet and SiC-NTs. The formation of strongly bound excitons is attributed to the enhanced electron-hole interaction in these low dimensional systems. Remarkably, the excited electron amplitude of the exciton wavefunction is found to peak on the Si atoms near the hole position (which is on the C site) in the zigzag SiC-NTs, indicating a charge transfer from an anion (hole) to its neighboring cations by photoexcitation.

Our results are relevant to indirect RIXS in correlated materials, such as high Tc cuprates. We demonstrate that RIXS spectra can be reduced to S(q,letter) when there is no screening channel for the core-hole potential in the intermediate state. We also show that two-magnon excitations are highlighted at the resonant photon energy when the core-hole potential in the corresponding intermediate state is poorly screened. Our results demonstrate that different elementary excitations can be emphasized at different intermediate states, such that selecting the exact incident energy is critical when trying to capture a particular elementary excitation.",11,[],8
1108.5783,cond-mat,"The transition between a regime in which thermodynamic relations apply only to ensembles of small systems coupled to a large environment and a regime in which they can be used to characterize individual macroscopic systems is analyzed in terms of the change in behavior of the Jarzynski estimator of equilibrium free energy differences from nonequilibrium work measurements. Given a fixed number of measurements, the Jarzynski estimator is unbiased for sufficiently small systems. In these systems, the directionality of time is poorly defined and configurations that dominate the empirical average, but which are in fact typical of the reverse process, are sufficiently well sampled. As the system size increases the arrow of time becomes better defined. The dominant atypical fluctuations become rare and eventually cannot be sampled with the limited resources that are available. Asymptotically, only typical work values are measured. The Jarzynski estimator becomes maximally biased and approaches the exponential of minus the average work, which is the result that is expected from standard macroscopic thermodynamics. In the proper scaling limit, this regime change can be described in terms of a phase transition in variants of the random energy model (REM). This correspondence is explicitly demonstrated in several examples of physical interest: near-equilibrium processes in which the work distribution is Gaussian, the sudden compression of an ideal gas and adiabatic quasi-static volume changes in a dilute real gas.",11,['physics'],8

We study the case where the quantum dot is initially charged with a single electron and is then filled with an additional, optically excited electron-hole pair, thus forming a charged exciton (trion). To make contact with recent experiments, we model an optical pump-probe setup, in which the two lowest quantum dot levels (s and p shells) are photo excited. Using the Lindblad master equation, we calculate the differential transmission spectrum as a function of the pump-probe time delay. Taking into account both spin conserving and spin-flip intraband relaxation processes, we find that the presence of the ground-state electron spin leads to an optical spin blockade at short delay times which is visible as a crossover between two exponential decays of the differential transmission. To make predictions for future experiments, we also study the dependence of the spin-blockade on an external magnetic field.",11,[],8

The observed equation dependences reflect the variations of the CPT Josephson inductance with equation and equation as well as the CPT excitation when the microwaves induce transitions between different quantum states of the CPT. The results are in excellent agreement with our simulations based on the numerical diagonalization of the circuit Hamiltonian.

1109.3293,cond-mat,"We report on depolarized and non-depolarized dynamic light scattering, static light scattering, and static viscosity measurements on interacting charged gibbsite platelets suspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The average collective and (long-time) translational self-diffusion coefficients, and the rotational diffusion coefficient, have been measured as functions of the platelet volume fraction letter, up to the isotropic-liquid crystal (I/LC) transition. The non-depolarized intensity autocorrelation function, measured at low scattering wavenumbers, consists of a fast and a slowly decaying mode which we interpret as the orientationally averaged collective and translational self-diffusion coefficients, respectively. Both the rotational and the long-time self-diffusion coefficients decrease very strongly, by more than two orders of magnitude, in going from the very dilute limit to the I/LC transition concentration. A similarly strong decrease, with increasing letter, is observed for the inverse zero-strain limiting static shear viscosity. With increasing letter, increasingly strong shear-thinning is observed, accompanied by a shrinking of the low shear-rate Newtonian plateau. The measured diffusion coefficients are interpreted theoretically in terms of a simple model of effective charged spheres interacting by a screened Coulomb potential, with hydrodynamic interactions included. The disk-like particle shape, and the measured particle radius and thickness polydispersities, enter into the model calculations via the scattering amplitudes. The interaction-induced enhancement of the collective diffusion coefficient by more than a factor of 20 at larger volume fractions is well captured in the effective sphere model, whereas the strong declines both of the experimental translational and rotational self-diffusion coefficients are underestimated.",11,[],8

We concentrate on membranes with negligible spontaneous curvature. At small droplet volume, bending energy dominates and the droplet is only partially wrapped by the membrane. At large volume, this configuration can become unstable and undergo a discontinuous transition to a state, in which the droplet is (almost) completely wrapped by the membrane. A morphology diagram, showing the parameter region where such budding transition occurs, is constructed as a function of the membrane tension and the intrinsic contact angle of the liquid with the membrane.

1107.5565,cond-mat,"The intermittent transition between slow growth and rapid shrinkage in polymeric assemblies is termed dynamic instability, a feature observed in a variety of biochemically distinct assemblies including microtubules, actin and their bacterial analogs. The existence of this labile phase of a polymer has many functional consequences in cytoskeletal dynamics, and its repeated appearance suggests that it is relatively easy to evolve. Here, we consider the minimal ingredients for the existence of dynamic instability by considering a single polymorphic filament that grows by binding to a substrate, undergoes a conformation change, and may unbind as a consequence of the residual strains induced by this change. We identify two parameters that control the phase space of possibilities for the filament: a structural mechanical parameter that characterizes the ratio of the bond strengths along the filament to those with the substrate (or equivalently the ratio of longitudinal to lateral interactions in an assembly), and a kinetic parameter that characterizes the ratio of time scales for growth and conformation change. In the deterministic limit, these parameters serve to demarcate a region of uninterrupted growth from that of collapse. However, in the presence of disorder in either the structural or the kinetic parameter the growth and collapse phases can coexist where the filament can grow slowly, shrink rapidly, and transition between these phases, thus exhibiting dynamic instability. We exhibit the window for the existence of dynamic instability in a phase diagram that allows us to quantify the evolvability of this labile phase.",11,['physics'],8

Emanating from the liquid-vapor critical point, there is a locus of isobaric specific heat maxima, called the Widom line, which is often regarded as an extension of the liquid-vapor coexistence line. Our simulation results show that the noise power spectrum of the density fluctuations on the Widom line of the liquid-vapor transition exhibits three distinct equation behaviors with exponents equation= 0, 1.2 and 2, depending on the frequency equation. We find that the intermediate frequency region with an exponent equation 1 appears as the temperature approaches the Widom temperature from above or below. On the other hand, we do not find three distinct regions of equation in the power spectrum of the potential energy fluctuations on the Widom line. Furthermore, we find that the power spectra of both the density and potential energy fluctuations at low frequency have a maximum on the Widom line, suggesting that the noise power can provide an alternative signature of the Widom line.",11,[],8
1102.2218,cond-mat,"Li and Haldane conjectured and numerically substantiated that the entanglement spectrum of the reduced density matrix of ground-states of time-reversal breaking topological phases (fractional quantum Hall states) contains information about the counting of their edge modes when the ground-state is cut in two spatially distinct regions and one of the regions is traced out. We analytically substantiate this conjecture for a series of FQH states defined as unique zero modes of pseudopotential Hamiltonians by finding a one to one map between the thermodynamic limit counting of two different entanglement spectra: the particle entanglement spectrum, whose counting of eigenvalues for each good quantum number is identical (up to accidental degeneracies) to the counting of bulk quasiholes, and the orbital entanglement spectrum (the Li-Haldane spectrum). As the particle entanglement spectrum is related to bulk quasihole physics and the orbital entanglement spectrum is related to edge physics, our map can be thought of as a mathematically sound microscopic description of bulk-edge correspondence in entanglement spectra. By using a set of clustering operators which have their origin in conformal field theory (CFT) operator expansions, we show that the counting of the orbital entanglement spectrum eigenvalues in the thermodynamic limit must be identical to the counting of quasiholes in the bulk. The latter equals the counting of edge modes at a hard-wall boundary placed on the sample. Moreover, we show this to be true even for CFT states which are likely bulk gapless, such as the Gaffnian wavefunction.",11,[],8
1107.2967,cond-mat,"Common algorithms for computationally simulating Langevin dynamics must discretize the stochastic differential equations of motion. These resulting finite time step integrators necessarily have several practical issues in common: Microscopic reversibility is violated, the sampled stationary distribution differs from the desired equilibrium distribution, and the work accumulated in nonequilibrium simulations is not directly usable in estimators based on nonequilibrium work theorems. Here, we show that even with a time-independent Hamiltonian, finite time step Langevin integrators can be thought of as a driven, nonequilibrium physical process. Once an appropriate work-like quantity is defined -- here called the shadow work -- recently developed nonequilibrium fluctuation theorems can be used to measure or correct for the errors introduced by the use of finite time steps. In particular, we demonstrate that amending estimators based on nonequilibrium work theorems to include this shadow work removes the time step dependent error from estimates of free energies. We also quantify, for the first time, the magnitude of deviations between the sampled stationary distribution and the desired equilibrium distribution for equilibrium Langevin simulations of solvated systems of varying size. While these deviations can be large, they can be eliminated altogether by Metropolization or greatly diminished by small reductions in the time step. Through this connection with driven processes, further developments in nonequilibrium fluctuation theorems can provide additional analytical tools for dealing with errors in finite time step integrators.",11,['physics'],8

After initializing in an onion state, we rotate the DWs to one side of the ring by passing a current through the center, and can switch between the two twisted states by reversing the current, causing the DWs to split and meet again on the opposite side of the ring. A larger current will annihilate the DWs and create a perfect vortex state in the rings.",11,[],8

By combining two junctions of three wires, we examine a system consisting of two parallel resistances. We study the conductance of this system as a function of the M matrices and the two resistances; we find that the total resistance is generally quite different from what one expects for a classical system of parallel resistances.

The optical conductivity (equation) of resonant exciton scales linearly with number of graphene layer (up to \emphat least 8 layers) implying quantum character of electrons in graphene. Furthermore, a prominent excitation at 5.4eV, which is a mixture of interband transitions from equation to equation at the M point and a equation plasmonic excitation, is observed. In contrast, for graphite the resonant exciton is not observable but strong interband transitions are seen instead. Supported by theoretical calculations, for equation 28 the equation is dominated by the resonant exciton, while for equation 28 it is a mixture between exitonic and interband transitions. The latter is characteristic for graphite, indicating a crossover in the electronic structure. Our study shows that important elementary excitations in graphene occur at high binding energies and elucidate the differences in the way electrons interact in graphene and graphite.",11,[],8

This paper explores the class of two-dimensional convolutional codes (2D CCs) and 2D tail-biting convolutional codes (2D TBCCs), in particular, from several aspects. First, we derive several basic algebraic properties of these codes, applying algebraic methods in order to find bijective encoders, create parity check matrices and to inverse encoders. Next, we discuss the minimum distance and weight distribution properties of these codes. Extending an existing tree-search algorithm to two dimensions, we apply it to find codes with high minimum distance. Word-error probability asymptotes for sample codes are given and compared with other codes. The results of this approach suggest that 2D TBCCs can perform better than comparable 1D TBCCs or other codes. We then present several novel iterative suboptimal algorithms for soft decoding 2D CCs, which are based on belief propagation. Two main approaches to decoding are considered. We first focus on a decoder which extends the concept of trellis decoding to two dimensions. Second, we investigate algorithms which use the code's parity check matrices. We apply conventional BP in the parity domain, but improve it with a novel modification. Next, we test the generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithm. Performance results are presented and compared with optimum decoding techniques and bounds.

They asked whether the hierarchical aTAM could allow a tile system to use the ability to form large assemblies in parallel before they attach to break the Omega(n) lower bound for assembly time. We show that there is a tile system with the optimal O(log n / log log n) tile types that assembles an n x n square using O(log2 n) parallel ""stages"", which is close to the optimal Omega(log n) stages, forming the final n x n square from four n/2 x n/2 squares, which are themselves recursively formed from n/4 x n/4 squares, etc. However, despite this nearly maximal parallelism, the system requires superlinear time to assemble the square. We extend the definition of *partial order tile systems* studied by Adleman et al. in a natural way to hierarchical assembly and show that no hierarchical partial order tile system can build any shape with diameter N in less than time Omega(N), demonstrating that in this case the hierarchical model affords no speedup whatsoever over the seeded model.

The objective of the user is to allocate his/her task to a processor with minimum load. We revisit the concurrent probabilistic protocol introduced in [6], which works in sequential rounds. In each round every task is allowed to query the load of one randomly chosen neighboring processor. If that load is smaller the task will migrate to that processor with a suitably chosen probability. Using techniques from spectral graph theory we obtain upper bounds on the expected convergence time towards approximate and exact Nash equilibria that are significantly better than the previous results in [6]. We show results for uniform tasks on non-uniform processors and the general case where the tasks have different weights and the machines have speeds. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results for this general setting.",11,[],7

1109.1865,cs,"Computational photography involves sophisticated capture methods. A new trend is to capture projection of higher dimensional visual signals such as videos, multi-spectral data and lightfields on lower dimensional sensors. Carefully designed capture methods exploit the sparsity of the underlying signal in a transformed domain to reduce the number of measurements and use an appropriate reconstruction method. Traditional progressive methods may capture successively more detail using a sequence of simple projection basis, such as DCT or wavelets and employ straightforward backprojection for reconstruction. Randomized projection methods do not use any specific sequence and use L0 minimization for reconstruction. In this paper, we analyze the statistical properties of natural images, videos, multi-spectral data and light-fields and compare the effectiveness of progressive and random projections. We define effectiveness by plotting reconstruction SNR against compression factor. The key idea is a procedure to measure best-case effectiveness that is fast, independent of specific hardware and independent of the reconstruction procedure. We believe this is the first empirical study to compare different lossy capture strategies without the complication of hardware or reconstruction ambiguity. The scope is limited to linear non-adaptive sensing. The results show that random projections produce significant advantages over other projections only for higher dimensional signals, and suggest more research to nascent adaptive and non-linear projection methods.",11,[],7
1106.5742,cs,"One of the fundamental challenges in the design of distributed wireless networks is the large dynamic range of network state. Since continuous tracking of global network state at all nodes is practically impossible, nodes can only acquire limited local views of the whole network to design their transmission strategies. In this paper, we study multi-layer wireless networks and assume that each node has only a limited knowledge, namely 1-local view, where each S-D pair has enough information to perform optimally when other pairs do not interfere, along with connectivity information for rest of the network. We investigate the information-theoretic limits of communication with such limited knowledge at the nodes. We develop a novel transmission strategy, namely Coded Layer Scheduling, that solely relies on 1-local view at the nodes and incorporates three different techniques: (1) per layer interference avoidance, (2) repetition coding to allow overhearing of the interference, and (3) network coding to allow interference neutralization. We show that our proposed scheme can provide a significant throughput gain compared with the conventional interference avoidance strategies. Furthermore, we show that our strategy maximizes the achievable normalized sum-rate for some classes of networks, hence, characterizing the normalized sum-capacity of those networks with 1-local view.",11,['math'],7
1105.1633,cs,"Computing accurate WCET on modern complex architectures is a challenging task. This problem has been devoted a lot of attention in the last decade but there are still some open issues. First, the control flow graph (CFG) of a binary program is needed to compute the WCET and this CFG is built using some internal knowledge of the compiler that generated the binary code; moreover once constructed the CFG has to be manually annotated with loop bounds. Second, the algorithms to compute the WCET (combining Abstract Interpretation and Integer Linear Programming) are tailored for specific architectures: changing the architecture (e.g. replacing an ARM7 by an ARM9) requires the design of a new ad hoc algorithm. Third, the tightness of the computed results (obtained using the available tools) are not compared to actual execution times measured on the real hardware. In this paper we address the above mentioned problems. We first describe a fully automatic method to compute a CFG based solely on the binary program to analyse. Second, we describe the model of the hardware as a product of timed automata, and this model is independent from the program description. The model of a program running on a hardware is obtained by synchronizing (the automaton of) the program with the (timed automata) model of the hardware. Computing the WCET is reduced to a reachability problem on the synchronised model and solved using the model-checker UPPAAL.

Thus, lifetime of sensory network depends on these closest nodes. Clustering methods are used to extend the lifetime of a wireless sensor network. However, current clustering algorithms usually utilize two techniques; selecting cluster heads with more residual energy, and rotating cluster heads periodically to distribute the energy consumption among nodes in each cluster and lengthen the network lifetime. Most of the algorithms use random selection for selecting the cluster heads. Here, we propose a novel trajectory clustering technique for selecting the cluster heads in WSNs.

1102.0899,cs,"The ability to predict the intentions of people based solely on their visual actions is a skill only performed by humans and animals. The intelligence of current computer algorithms has not reached this level of complexity, but there are several research efforts that are working towards it. With the number of classification algorithms available, it is hard to determine which algorithm works best for a particular situation. In classification of visual human intent data, Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and their variants, are leading candidates.   The inability of HMMs to provide a probability in the observation to observation linkages is a big downfall in this classification technique. If a person is visually identifying an action of another person, they monitor patterns in the observations. By estimating the next observation, people have the ability to summarize the actions, and thus determine, with pretty good accuracy, the intention of the person performing the action. These visual cues and linkages are important in creating intelligent algorithms for determining human actions based on visual observations.   The Evidence Feed Forward Hidden Markov Model is a newly developed algorithm which provides observation to observation linkages. The following research addresses the theory behind Evidence Feed Forward HMMs, provides mathematical proofs of their learning of these parameters to optimize the likelihood of observations with a Evidence Feed Forwards HMM, which is important in all computational intelligence algorithm, and gives comparative examples with standard HMMs in classification of both visual action data and measurement data; thus providing a strong base for Evidence Feed Forward HMMs in classification of many types of problems.",11,['math'],7

In dynamic and decentralized settings where the traffic, topology and channel states may vary over time and the communication between agents is impractical, it is important to formulate and study games of incomplete information and fully distributed learning algorithms which for each agent requires a minimal amount of information regarding the remaining agents. In this paper, we address this major challenge and introduce heterogeneous learning schemes in which each agent adopts a distinct learning pattern in the context of games with incomplete information. We use stochastic approximation techniques to show that the heterogeneous learning schemes can be studied in terms of their deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) counterparts. Depending on the learning rates of the players, these ODEs could be different from the standard replicator dynamics, (myopic) best response (BR) dynamics, logit dynamics, and fictitious play dynamics.

We propose the study of cuckoo hashing with pages, advocating approaches where each key has several possible locations, or cells, on a single page, and additional choices on a second backup page.

Specifically, we show that in the Uniform Additive Model, both computing the optimal marketing strategy and computing the best IE strategy are equation-hard for undirected social networks. We observe that allowing IE strategies to offer prices smaller than the myopic price in the exploit step leads to a measurable improvement on their performance. Thus, we show that the best IE strategy approximates the maximum revenue within a factor of 0.911 for undirected and of roughly 0.553 for directed networks. Moreover, we present a natural generalization of IE strategies, with more than two pricing classes, and show that they approximate the maximum revenue within a factor of roughly 0.7 for undirected and of roughly 0.35 for directed networks. Utilizing a connection between good IE strategies and large cuts in the underlying social network, we obtain polynomial-time algorithms that approximate the revenue of the best IE strategy within a factor of roughly 0.9.

A Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) framework is applied on these graphs, giving birth to a Bag-of-Graph-Words representation. The nested nature of the descriptors consists in scaling from trivial Delaunay graphs - isolated feature points - by increasing the number of nodes layer by layer up to graphs with maximal number of nodes. For each layer of graphs its proper visual dictionary is built.

As a corollary, we obtain that any two-party protocol for computing a random function on equation must reveal equation bits of information to the participants.

1109.6440,cs,"This article provides a completion to theories of information based on entropy, resolving a longstanding question in its axiomatization as proposed by Shannon and pursued by Jaynes. We show that Shannon's entropy function has a complementary dual function which we call ""extropy."" The entropy and the extropy of a binary distribution are identical. However, the measure bifurcates into a pair of distinct measures for any quantity that is not merely an event indicator. As with entropy, the maximum extropy distribution is also the uniform distribution, and both measures are invariant with respect to permutations of their mass functions. However, they behave quite differently in their assessments of the refinement of a distribution, the axiom which concerned Shannon and Jaynes. Their duality is specified via the relationship among the entropies and extropies of course and fine partitions. We also analyze the extropy function for densities, showing that relative extropy constitutes a dual to the Kullback-Leibler divergence, widely recognized as the continuous entropy measure. These results are unified within the general structure of Bregman divergences. In this context they identify half the equation metric as the extropic dual to the entropic directed distance.

Future opportunities affect strategic considerations of the players in each auction, introducing externalities. Motivated by this consideration, we study a setting of a market of buyers and sellers, where each seller holds one item, bidders have combinatorial valuations and sellers hold item auctions sequentially.   Our results are qualitatively different from those of simultaneous auctions, proving that simultaneity is a crucial aspect of previous work. We prove that if sellers hold sequential first price auctions then for unit-demand bidders (matching market) every subgame perfect equilibrium achieves at least half of the optimal social welfare, while for submodular bidders or when second price auctions are used, the social welfare can be arbitrarily worse than the optimal. We also show that a first price sequential auction for buying or selling a base of a matroid is always efficient, and implements the VCG outcome.   An important tool in our analysis is studying first and second price auctions with externalities (bidders have valuations for each possible winner outcome), which can be of independent interest.

1107.2003,cs,"Data races can significantly affect the executions of multi-threaded programs. Hence, one has to recur the results of data races to deterministically replay a multi-threaded program. However, data races are concealed in enormous number of memory operations in a program. Due to the difficulty of accurately identifying data races, previous multi-threaded deterministic record/replay schemes for commodity multi-processor system give up to record data races directly. Consequently, they either record all shared memory operations, which brings remarkable slowdown to the production run, or record the synchronization only, which introduces significant efforts to replay.   Inspired by the advances in data race detection, we propose an efficient software-only deterministic replay scheme for commodity multi-processor systems, which is named RacX. The key insight of RacX is as follows: although it is NP-hard to accurately identify the existence of data races between a pair of memory operations, we can find out all potential data races in a multi-threaded program, in which the false positives can be reduced to a small amount with our automatic false positive reduction techniques. As a result, RacX can efficiently monitor all potential data races to deterministically replay a multi-threaded program.   To evaluate RacX, we have carried out experiments over a number of well-known multi-threaded programs from SPLASH-2 benchmark suite and large-scale commercial programs. RacX can precisely recur production runs of these programs with value determinism. Averagely, RacX causes only about 1.21%, 1.89%, 2.20%, and 8.41% slowdown to the original run during recording (for 2-, 4-, 8- and 16-thread programs, respectively).

In this work, sensitive data is characterized as the contents of a set of secrecy views.

In particular, if this user poses a query about any of these views, no meaningful information is returned. Since the database is not expected to be physically changed to produce this result, the updates are only virtual. And also minimal in a precise way. These minimal updates are reflected in the secrecy view contents, and also in the fact that query answers, while being privacy preserving, are also maximally informative. Virtual updates are based on the use of null values as used in the SQL standard. We provide the semantics of secrecy views and the virtual updates.

In particular, when the costs are all equal (\emphcardinality constraint), a classic result by Nemhauser et al shows that the greedy algorithm provides an equation approximation.   Motivated by many papers that utilize demand queries to elicit the preferences of agents in economic settings, we develop algorithms that guarantee improved approximation ratios in the presence of demand oracles. We are able to break the equation barrier: we present algorithms that use only polynomially many demand queries and have approximation ratios of equation for the general problem and equation for maximization subject to a cardinality constraint.   We also consider the more general class of subadditive valuations. We present algorithms that obtain an approximation ratio of equation for the general problem and 2 for maximization subject to a cardinality constraint.

This equation is then interpreted as coming from the canonical quantization of a simple constraint in Regge calculus. This suggests to lift and generalize this constraint to the phase space of loop quantum gravity parametrized by twisted geometries. The result is a reformulation of the flat model for topological BF theory from the Hamiltonian perspective. The Wheeler-de-Witt equation in the spin network basis gives difference equations which are exactly recursion relations on the 15j-symbol.

Traditional approaches to estimating the sensitivity of such searches use either computationally-expensive Monte Carlo simulations, or analytic methods which sacrifice accuracy by making an unphysical assumption about the population of sources being searched for. This paper develops a new, analytic method of estimating search sensitivity which does not rely upon this unphysical assumption.

It is actually in quantizing gravity that the polymer term holds proper as the quantum geometry excitations yield a reminiscent of a polymer material. In such an approach both non-singular cosmological models and a microscopic basis for the entropy of some black holes have arisen. Also important physical questions for these systems involve thermodynamics. With this motivation, in this work, we study the statistical thermodynamics of two one dimensional \em polymer quantum systems: an ensemble of oscillators that describe a solid and a bunch of non-interacting particles in a box, which thus form an ideal gas. We first study the spectra of these polymer systems. It turns out useful for the analysis to consider the length scale required by the quantization and which we shall refer to as polymer length. The dynamics of the polymer oscillator can be given the form of that for the standard quantum pendulum. Depending on the dominance of the polymer length we can distinguish two regimes: vibrational and rotational. The first occur for small polymer length and here the standard oscillator in Schrodinger quantization is recovered at leading order. The second one, for large polymer length, features dominant polymer effects. In the case of the polymer particles in the box, a bounded and oscillating spectrum that presents a band structure and a Brillouin zone is found. The thermodynamical quantities calculated with these spectra have corrections with respect to standard ones and they depend on the polymer length. For generic polymer length, thermodynamics of both systems present an anomalous peak in their heat capacity equation.",11,"['cond-mat', 'hep-th']",13

However, as in the isotropic models in LQC, these do not necessarily imply a physical singularity. Analysis of geodesics and strength of such singular events, point towards a general resolution of all known types of strong singularities.

Aligning the calibrated EOB waveforms and the numerical waveforms at low frequency, the phase difference of the (2,2) mode between model and numerical simulation remains below 0.1 rad throughout the evolution for all mass ratios considered. The fractional amplitude difference at peak amplitude of the (2,2) mode is 2% and grows to 12% during the ringdown. Using the Advanced LIGO noise curve we study the effectualness and measurement accuracy of the EOB model, and stress the relevance of modeling the higher-order modes for parameter estimation.

For a symmetric mass system with total mass between 10 and 100 Msun, the detector is sensitive instead to the inspiral phase and the in-band signal has a longer duration, between 30 ms - 3 s.

We found that radiation accretion increases the lifetime of primordial black holes whereas phantom accretion decreases the lifespan of primordial black holes. Investigating the competition between the radiation accretion and phantom accretion, we got that there is an instant during the matter-dominated era beyond which phantom accretion dominates radiation accretion. So the primordial black holes which are formed in the later part of radiation dominated era and in matter dominated era are evaporated at a quicker rate than the Hawking evaporation.

We argue that there exist only three possible scenarios, depending on whether the classical notion of long-lived horizon is preserved by high-energy physics and on whether the dark and compact astrophysical objects that we observe have long-lived horizons in the first place. Along the way, we find that (i) a theory with high-energy superluminal signalling and a long-lived trapping horizon would be extremely unstable in astrophysical terms and that (ii) stellar pulsations of objects hovering right outside but extremely close to their gravitational radius can result in a mechanism for Hawking-like emission.",11,['hep-th'],13
1104.4199,gr-qc,"The late-time behavior of a scalar field on fixed Kerr background is examined in a numerical framework incorporating the techniques of conformal compactification and hyperbolic initial value formulation. The applied code is 1(12) as it is based on the use of the spectral method in the angular directions while in the time-radial section fourth order finite differencing, along with the method of lines, is applied. The evolution of various types of stationary and non-stationary pure multipole initial states are investigated. The asymptotic decay rates are determined not only in the domain of outer communication but along the event horizon and at future null infinity as well. The decay rates are found to be different for stationary and non-stationary initial data, and they also depend on the fall off properties of the initial data toward future null infinity. The energy and angular momentum transfers are found to show significantly different behavior in the initial phase of the time evolution. The quasinormal ringing phase and the tail phase are also investigated. In the tail phase, the decay exponents for the energy and angular momentum losses at future null infinity are found to be smaller than at the horizon which is in accordance with the behavior of the field itself and it means that at late times the energy and angular momentum falling into the black hole become negligible in comparison with the energy and angular momentum radiated toward future null infinity. The energy and angular momentum balances are used as additional verifications of the reliability of our numerical method.",11,[],13

1110.1772,gr-qc,"By releasing a formula that directly connects the average amplitude of the relic stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) with the Inflaton field and the equation for the characteristic amplitude hc for the relic SGWB, in this paper the upper bounds on the relic SGWB from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) Scientific Collaboration (LSC) data are translated in lower bounds on the Inflaton field. The results show that the value of the Inflaton field that arises from the WMAP bound on the relic SGWB is totally consistent with the famous slow roll condition on Inflation, while the value of the Inflaton field that arises from the LSC bound on the relic SGWB could not be consistent with such a condition. In any case, the analysis in this paper shows that the detection of the SGWB will permit a direct measure of the value of the Inflaton field by giving an extraordinary precious and precise information about the early Universe's dynamics.

1109.4739,gr-qc,"In order to deal with a large cosmological constant a relaxation mechanism based on modified gravity has been proposed recently. By virtue of this mechanism the effect of the vacuum energy density of a given quantum field/string theory (no matter how big is its initial value in the early universe) can be neutralized dynamically, i.e. without fine tuning, and hence a Big Bang-like evolution of the cosmos becomes possible. Remarkably, a large class Fnm of models of this kind, namely capable of dynamically adjusting the vacuum energy irrespective of its value and size, has been identified. In this paper, we carefully put them to the experimental test. By performing a joint likelihood analysis we confront these models with the most recent observational data on type Ia supernovae (SNIa), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and the high redshift data on the expansion rate, so as to determine which ones are the most favored by observations. We compare the optimal relaxation models Fnm found by this method with the standard or concordance LambdaCDM model, and find that some of these models may appear as almost indistinguishable from it. Interestingly enough, this shows that it is possible to construct viable solutions to the tough cosmological fine tuning problem with models that display the same basic phenomenological features as the concordance model.",11,"['astro-ph', 'hep-ph', 'hep-th']",13

1105.6296,gr-qc,"One hope to solve the cosmological constant problem is to identify a symmetry principle, based on which the cosmological constant can be reduced either to zero, or to a tiny value. Here, we note that requiring that the vacuum state is Lorentz invariant significantly reduces the theoretical value of the vacuum energy density. Hence, this also reduces the discrepancy between the observed value of the cosmological constant and its theoretical expectation, down from 123 orders of magnitude to 56 orders of magnitude. We find that, at one loop level, massless particles do not yield any contribution to the cosmological constant. Another important consequence of Lorentz symmetry is stabilization of the gravitational hierarchy: the cosmological constant (divided by Newton's constant) does not run as the quartic power of the renormalization group scale, but instead only logarithmically.",11,"['astro-ph', 'hep-th']",13
1103.3874,gr-qc,"Binary neutron-star systems represent one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves. In order to be able to extract important information, notably about the equation of state of matter at nuclear density, it is necessary to have in hands an accurate analytical model of the expected waveforms. Following our recent work, we here analyze more in detail two general-relativistic simulations spanning about 20 gravitational-wave cycles of the inspiral of equal-mass binary neutron stars with different compactnesses, and compare them with a tidal extension of the effective-one-body (EOB) analytical model. The latter tidally extended EOB model is analytically complete up to the 1.5 post-Newtonian level, and contains an analytically undetermined parameter representing a higher-order amplification of tidal effects. We find that, by calibrating this single parameter, the EOB model can reproduce, within the numerical error, the two numerical waveforms essentially up to the merger.

1106.1436,hep-ph,"We discuss the classification of symmetries and the corresponding symmetry groups in the two-Higgs-doublet model (THDM). We give an easily useable method how to determine the symmetry class and corresponding symmetry group of a given THDM Higgs potential. One of the symmetry classes corresponds to a Higgs potential with several simultaneous generalised CP symmetries. Extending the CP symmetry of this class to the Yukawa sector in a straightforward way, the so-called maximally-CP-symmetric model (MCPM) is obtained. We study the evolution of the quartic Higgs-potential parameters under a change of renormalisation point. Finally we compute the so called oblique parameters S, T, and U, in the MCPM and we identify large regions of viable parameter space with respect to electroweak precision measurements. We present the corresponding allowed regions for the masses of the physical Higgs bosons. Reasonable ranges for these masses, up to several hundred GeV, are obtained which should make the (extra) Higgs bosons detectable in LHC experiments.",11,[],2

We report here on a recent phenomenological study where we apply a previously developped scheme which consistently takes into account the twist 3 distribution amplitudes for transversely polarized rho meson. The computation of the gamma* to rho impact factor are performed within collinear factorization of QCD, up to the twist 3 level, based on the Collinear Factorization scheme applied to the amplitudes gamma*g to g rho .

The models capture the holographic dynamics of the dilaton (dual to the YM coupling) and a tachyon (dual to the chiral condensate), and are parametrized by the real parameter x, which can take values within the range 0 <= x < 11/2. We analyze the saddle point solutions, and draw the phase diagram at zero temperature and density. The backreaction of flavor on the glue is fully included. We find the conformal window for x >= xc, and the QCD-like phase with chiral symmetry breaking at x < xc, where the critical value xc lies close to four. We also find Miransky scaling as x -> xc as well as Efimov-like saddle points. By calculating the holographic beta-functions, we demonstrate the ""walking"" behavior of the coupling in the region near and below xc.",11,['hep-th'],2

Using this effective Hamiltonian, we study neutrino mixing and oscillations in nuclear media and strong magnetic fields. We compute neutrino mixing angle and mass squared difference, and find the pattern of vacuum neutrino oscillations is modified in magnetized nuclear media. Comparing with the vacuum neutrino oscillation, we find that for high-energy neutrinos, neutrino oscillations are suppressed in the presence of nuclear media. In the general case of neutral nuclear media with the presence of electrons, we calculate the mixing angle and mass squared difference, and discuss the resonance and level-crossing in neutrino oscillations.",11,[],2

1110.5251,hep-ph,We present a calculation of heavy-flavor production in hadronic collisions in association with one jet matched to parton shower Monte Carlo programs at next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD. Top-quark decays are included and spin correlations in the decay products are taken into account. The calculation builds on existing results for the radiative corrections to heavy-quark plus one jet production and uses the POWHEG BOX for the interface to the parton shower programs PYTHIA or HERWIG. A broad phenomenological study for the Large Hadron Collider and the Tevatron is presented.

With unpolarized beams the leading order effects of non commutativity starts from second order in non commutative(NC) parameter i.e. equation, while with polarized beams these corrections appear at first order (equation) in cross section. The corrections in Compton case can probe the magnetic component(equation) while in Pair production and Pair annihilation probe the electric component(equation) of NC parameter. We include the effects of earth rotation in our analysis. This study is done by investigating the effects of non commutativity on different time averaged cross section observables.

We present a complete treatment of how thermalization proceeds, at the parametric weak-coupling level. We show that plasma instabilities dominate the dynamics, from immediately after the collision until well after the plasma becomes nearly in equilibrium. Initially they drive the system close to isotropy, but Bjorken expansion and increasing diluteness makes the system again become more anisotropic. At time letter ~ \alpha(-12/5) Q(-1) the dynamics become dominated by a nearly-thermal bath; and at time letter ~ \alpha(-5/2) Q(-1)$ the bath comes to dominate the energy density, completing thermalization.

1104.0511,hep-ph,Parity violating electron-deuteron scattering can potentially provide a clean access to electroweak couplings that are sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model. However hadronic effects can contaminate their extraction from high-precision measurements. Power-suppressed contributions are one of the main sources of uncertainties along with charge-symmetry violating effects in leading-twist parton densities. In this work we calculate the twist-four correlation functions contributing to the left-right polarization asymmetry making use of nucleon multiparton light-cone wave functions.,11,[],2
1110.2313,hep-ph,"One contribution to the energy loss of hard partons propagating through a medium as created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion (A-A) collisions are elastic scattering processes with medium constituents. The magnitude of this energy loss contribution depends crucially on the effective mass of the medium constituents - in the limit of non-recoiling static scattering centers, elastic energy loss vanishes. Thus, it is important to constrain the amount of elastic energy loss in order to gain information about the nature of the degrees of freedom in the medium as resolved by a hard parton. So far, the relative fraction of elastic (or rather incoherent) energy loss has been constrained from above by using pathlength dependent observables. However, using the observation that subleading gluon energy dissipation into the medium is probed by some observables, such as hard dihadron correlations or the dijet asymmetry, a constraint from below can also be found. In this work, this idea is worked out within the in-medium shower evolution Monte Carlo (MC) code YaJEM-D.",11,[],2
1101.4387,hep-ph,"In this paper we discuss the excess gamma rays from the Galactic center, the WMAP haze and the CoGeNT and DAMA results in WIMPless models. At the same time we also investigate the low energy constraints from the anomalous magnetic moment of leptons and from some lepton flavor violating decays. It is found that, for scalar or vector WIMPless dark matter, neither the WMAP haze nor the CoGeNT and DAMA observations could be explained simultaneously with the excess gamma rays from the Galactic center. As to fermion WIMPless dark matter, it is only marginally possible to accommodate the CoGeNT and DAMA results with the excess gamma rays from the Galactic center with vector connector fields. On the other hand, only scalar connector fields could interpret the WMAP haze concerning the constraints of anomalous magnetic moment of leptons. Furthermore, if there is only one connector field for all the charged leptons, some lepton flavor violating decays could happen with too large branching ratios severely violating the experimental bounds.",11,['astro-ph'],2
1109.6930,hep-ph,"In this letter, we propose that the recent measurement of superluminal neutrinos in OPERA could be explained by the existence of a domain wall which is left behind after the phase transition of some scalar field in the universe. The scalar field couples to the neutrino and photon field with different effective couplings. It causes different effective metrics and the emergence of superluminal neutrinos. Moreover, if the supernova and the earth are in the same plane parallel to the wall, or the thickness of the wall is much smaller than the distance from the supernova to the earth, the contradiction between OPERA and SN1987a can be reconciled.",11,['hep-th'],2

In the standard ChPT approach, limited to low momenta, we study the S, P and D waves. Unitarization extends the analysis to energies of around 1 GeV, being compatible with standard ChPT at low energies for the S and P waves. We then compare with lattice results and find a good agreement of standard ChPT below p \sim 200 MeV for the I=2, J=0 and I=1, J=1 channels and up to p \sim 500 MeV for the I=2, J=2 channel. Unitarized ChPT improves the agreement in the scalar and vector channels at higher energies. We have also performed a Montecarlo analysis to provide an estimation of the uncertainties.",11,[],2
1107.3814,hep-ph,"We study an extension of the Higgs sector of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), considering the effects of new degrees of freedom at the TeV scale, and allowing for sources of CP violation beyond the MSSM (BMSSM). We analyze the impact of the BMSSM sources of CP violation on the Higgs collider phenomenology and on low energy flavor and CP violating observables. We identify distinct Higgs collider signatures that cannot be realized, either in the case without CP violating phases or in the CP violating MSSM, and investigate the prospects to probe them at the Tevatron and the LHC. The most striking benchmark scenario has three neutral Higgs bosons that all decay dominantly into W boson pairs and that are well within the reach of the 7 TeV LHC run. On the other hand, we also present scenarios with three Higgs bosons that have masses MHi > 150 GeV and decay dominantly into b bbar. Such scenarios are much more challenging to probe and can even lie completely outside the reach of the 7 TeV LHC run. We explore complementary scenarios with standard MSSM Higgs signals that allow to accommodate a sizable Bs mixing phase as indicated by D0, as well as the excess in Bs to mu mu- candidates recently reported by CDF. We find that, in contrast to the MSSM, a minimal flavor violating soft sector is sufficient to generate significant corrections to CP violating observables in meson mixing, compatible with EDM constraints. In particular, a sizable Bs mixing phase, Spsiphi < 0.4, can be achieved for specific regions of parameter space. Such a large Bs mixing phase would unambiguously imply a sizable suppression of SpsiKs with respect to the SM prediction and a BR(Bs to mu mu-) close to the 95% C.L. upper bound reported by CDF.",11,[],2
1107.4354,hep-ph,"The search for the Higgs boson is entering a decisive phase. The Large Hadron Collider experiments have collected more than 1 fbequation of data and are now capable of efficiently probing the high Higgs mass region, equation GeV. The low mass region is more challenging at the LHC, but if the Higgs has Standard Model (SM)-like properties, the LHC should find evidence for it by the end of next year. In low energy supersymmetric extensions of the SM, the situation is similar for large values of the CP-odd Higgs mass equation, but more interesting for lower values of equation. The (equation =7 TeV) LHC searches for a low-mass Standard Model Higgs boson predominantly in the equation decay modes, which may be suppressed by an increase in the equation partial widths (and thus the total equation width) for equation GeV. Although equation are sought at the LHC, these channels are not powerful enough to fully counter this suppression in the first year of running. We consider two alternative possibilities for probing the low equation region: nonstandard Higgs boson searches at the LHC, and a statistical combination with the Tevatron, where equation is the primary search channel for light equation. We also study an MSSM scenario in which the equation rate is enhanced at low equation to the point where discovery is possible in the near future.",11,['hep-ex'],2

Our approach combines partitioning of the final-state phase space together with the technique of sector decomposition, following recent suggestions in Ref. [1]. We apply this scheme to a toy example: the NNLO QED corrections to the decay of the Z boson to a pair of massless leptons. We argue that the main features of this subtraction scheme remain valid for computations of processes of arbitrary complexity with NNLO accuracy.",11,[],2
1110.6904,hep-ph,"We analyze equation and equation, equation, within the local-duality (LD) version of QCD sum rules, which allows one to obtain predictions for hadron form factors in a broad range of momentum transfers. To probe the accuracy of this approximate method, we consider, in parallel to QCD, a potential model: in this case, the exact form factors may be calculated from the solutions of the Schrodinger equation and confronted with the results from the quantum-mechanical LD sum rule. On the basis of our quantum-mechanical analysis we conclude that the LD sum rule is expected to give reliable predictions for equation and equation in the region equation GeVequation. Moreover, the accuracy of the method improves rather fast with growing equation in this region. For the pion elastic form factor, the data at small equation indicate that the LD limit may be reached already at relatively low values of momentum transfers, equation GeVequation; we therefore conclude that large deviations from LD in the region equation GeVequation reported in some recent theoretical analyses seem unlikely. The data on the (equation form factors meet very well the expectations from the LD model. Surprisingly, the \sc BaBar results for the equation form factor imply a violation of LD growing with equation even at equation GeVequation, at odds with the equation case and the experience from quantum mechanics.",11,[],2
1112.3017,hep-ph,"The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have reported an excess of events in the letterletter, ZZ*\to 4\ell and WW* search channels at an invariant mass m \simeq 125 GeV, which could be the first evidence for the long-awaited Higgs boson. We investigate the consequences of requiring mh\simeq 125 GeV in both the mSUGRA and NUHM2 SUSY models. In mSUGRA, large values of trilinear soft breaking parameter A0 are required, and universal scalar m0\agt 0.8 TeV is favored so that we expect squark and slepton masses typically in the multi-TeV range. This typically gives rise to an ""effective SUSY"" type of sparticle mass spectrum. In this case, we expect gluino pair production as the dominant sparticle creation reaction at LHC. For m0< 5 TeV, the superpotential parameter letter > 2 TeV and mA> 0.8 TeV, greatly restricting neutralino annihilation mechanisms. These latter conclusions are softened if m0\sim 10-20 TeV or if one proceeds to the NUHM2 model. The standard neutralino abundance tends to be far above WMAP-measured values unless the neutralino is higgsino-like. We remark upon possible non-standard (but perhaps more attractive) cosmological scenarios which can bring the predicted dark matter abundance into accord with the measured value, and discuss the implications for direct and indirect detection of neutralino cold dark matter.",11,['astro-ph'],2
1109.6768,hep-ph,"The NA61/SHINE collaboration measured inclusive cross sections of letter and letter- meson production in the interactions of 31 GeV/c protons with carbon nuclei at forward emission angles (0 - 420 mrad). The collaboration also presented predictions of Monte Carlo models - FLUKA, VENUS and UrQMD, in comparison with the data. A careful analysis shows that deviations of the FLUKA and VENUS predictions from the data have different tendencies. The worst description of the data was observed for the UrQMD model results.   All the models assume the creation of quark-gluon strings in the interactions, but it is complicated to analyze the models in order to find the source of the deviations. Thus, the quark-gluon string model - FRITIOF (FTF) - was implemented in the GEANT4 toolkit and is used to understand the deviations mentioned above. It was found that the most important factor influencing the FTF calculations is the sampling of quark-gluon string masses.

1107.3856,hep-ph,"The complex Clebsch-Gordon coefficients in the double tetrahedral group T' offers the possibility that CP violation can be entirely geometrical in origin, as pointed out by us recently.

In terms of 9 independent parameters in the Yukawa sector, the predicted values of the 22 observables agree with current experimental values, including the recent T2K and MINOS results. The correction to the tri-bimaximal mixing pattern is related to the Cabibbo angle, leading to interesting quark-lepton complementarity sum rules. Our predicted value for the leptonic Dirac CP phase is 227 degrees, which gives rise to sufficient amount of lepton number asymmetry, in the presence of the flavor effect.

We show that such a core corona separation allows to improve the description of strange particle ratios and flow as a function of beam energy as well as strange particle yields as a function of centrality.,11,[],2
1103.2771,hep-ph,"In existing dark matter models with global symmetries the relic abundance of dark matter is either equal to that of anti-dark matter (thermal WIMP), or vastly larger, with essentially no remaining anti-dark matter (asymmetric dark matter). By exploring the consequences of a primordial asymmetry on the coupled dark matter and anti-dark matter Boltzmann equations we find large regions of parameter space that interpolate between these two extremes. Interestingly, this new asymmetric WIMP framework can accommodate a wide range of dark matter masses and annihilation cross sections. The present-day dark matter population is typically asymmetric, but only weakly so, such that indirect signals of dark matter annihilation are not completely suppressed.

1103.4618,hep-ph,"The recent Tevatron measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry of the top quark shows an intriguing discrepancy with Standard Model expectations, particularly at large equation invariant masses. Measurements of this quantity are subtle at the LHC, due to its equation initial state, however, one can define a forward-central-charge asymmetry which captures the physics. We study the capability of the LHC to measure this asymmetry and find that within the SM a measurement at the equation level is possible with roughly 60 fbequation at equation TeV. If nature realizes a model which enhances the asymmetry (as is necessary to explain the Tevatron measurements), a significant difference from zero can be observed much earlier, perhaps even during early LHC running at equation TeV. We further explore the capabilities of the 7 TeV LHC to discover resonances or contact interactions which modify the equation invariant mass distribution using recent boosted top tagging techniques. We find that TeV-scale color octet resonances can be discovered, even with small coupling strengths and that contact interactions can be probed at scales exceeding 6 TeV.

The present authors suggested a check on such backgrounds consisting of a tight restriction on the muon impact parameter equation, to confirm that this excess was indeed due to equation meson decays. The D0 Collaboration has performed a related check applying transverse impact parameter (IP) restrictions, whose implications are discussed.

The part of the CMSSM parameter space that is compatible with the measured astrophysical density of cold dark matter is known to include a stau1 - chi coannihilation strip, a focus-point strip where chi has an enhanced Higgsino component, and a funnel at large tanb where the annihilation rate is enhanced by the poles of nearby heavy MSSM Higgs bosons, A/H. We calculate the total annihilation rates, the fractions of annihilations into different Standard Model final states and the resulting fluxes of gamma rays for CMSSM scenarios along these strips. We observe that typical annihilation rates are much smaller in the coannihilation strip for tanb = 10 than along the focus-point strip or for tanb = 55, and that the annihilation branching ratios differ greatly between the different dark matter strips. Whereas the current Fermi-LAT data are not sensitive to any of the CMSSM scenarios studied, and the calculated gamma-ray fluxes are probably unobservably low along the coannihilation strip for tanb = 10, we find that substantial portions of the focus-point strips and rapid-annihilation funnel regions could be pressured by several more years of Fermi-LAT data, if understanding of the astrophysical background and/or systematic uncertainties can be improved in parallel.",11,['astro-ph'],2

We show that, due to A - etab mixing, the branching ratio H -> AA -> 4 tau is strongly reduced for MA in the range 9 - 10.5 GeV. This is the range of MA in which the tension between the observed etab(1S) mass and its prediction based on QCD can be resolved due to mixing, and which is thus still consistent with a light CP-even Higgs boson H satisfying LEP constraints with a mass well below 114 GeV.

The procedure leads to IR divergences in the three-body decay X(3872) \to lettercJ letter letter when virtual D mesons can go on-shell in tree level HHletterPT diagrams.

Forward scattering amplitudes in HHletterPT are matched onto local operators in XEFT, the imaginary parts of which are responsible for the decay of the X(3872).

When the Einsteinian gravity is switched on into this model, then it is argued that the metric gletterletter(x) of spacetime is proportional to <letterletter(x) letterletter(x)>vac, being in this way classical in its nature, not the subject of quantization within an overall quantum theory including gravitation. A Lagrangian density(generally dependent on letterletter and its first and second derivatives) is tentatively proposed in such a form, where letterletter appears also outside of Aletterletter, spoiling the trivial gauge invariance of our earlier model with respect to the gauging field letterletter. If the cosmological constant letter is neglected, then the term with letterletter outside of Aletterletter vanishes.",11,[],2

To extract the result we work in the Zero-Mass Variable-Flavor-Number scheme(ZM-VFNs) using realistic nonperturbative fragmentation functions obtained through a global fit to equation data from CERN LEP1 and SLAC SLC on the Z-boson resonance. We study both the contribution of the bottom-quark fragmentation and the gluon fragmentation to produce the bottom-flavored meson (B-Meson). We find that the contribution of the gluon leads to an appreciable reduction in decay rate at low values of the B-meson energy. It means the NLO corrections are significant.,11,[],2

Specifically, we demonstrate that the viable corners of parameter space may be identified by their proximity to an enhanced discrete symmetry point. At this point, the global symmetry group of the theory is extended by a discrete group under which the scalar sector is non-trivially charged, and the discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken such that the discrete symmetry relates degenerate electroweak preserving and breaking vacua. This idea is used to investigate several specific models of the electroweak symmetry breaking sector.

1108.2630,hep-ph,"Dark matter trapped in the Sun produces a flux of all flavors of neutrinos, which then reach the Earth after propagating out of the Sun and oscillating from the production point to the detector. The typical signal which is looked at refers to the muon neutrino component and consists of a flux of up-going muons in a neutrino detector. We propose instead a novel signature: the possibility of looking at the tau neutrino component of the dark matter signal, which is almost background-free in the downward-going direction, since the tau neutrino amount in atmospheric neutrinos is negligible and in the down-going baseline atmospheric muon-neutrinos have no time to sizably oscillate. We analyze the prospects of studying the downward-going tau neutrinos from dark matter annihilation (or decay) in the Sun in Cherenkov detectors, by looking at hadronic showers produced in the charged-current tau neutrino interactions and subsequent tau decay. We discuss the various sources of background (namely the small tau neutrino component in atmospheric neutrinos, both from direct production and from oscillations; tau neutrinos from solar corona interactions; the galactic tau neutrino component) as well as sources of background due to misidentification of electron and muon events. We find that the downward-going tau neutrinos signal has potentially very good prospects for Mton scale Cherenkov detectors, the main limitation being the level of misidentification of non-tau events, which need to be kept at level of percent. Several tens of events per year (depending on the dark matter mass and annihilation/decay channel) are potentially collectible with a Mton scale detector, and a 5 sigma significance discovery is potentially reachable for dark matter masses in the range from 20 to 300 GeV with a few years of exposure on a Mton detector.",11,[],2

1107.4309,hep-ph,"Massive Z'-gauge bosons act as excellent harbingers for string compactifications with a low string scale. In D-brane models they are associated to U(1) gauge symmetries that are either anomalous in four dimensions or exhibit a hidden higher dimensional anomaly. We discuss the possible signals of massive Z'-gauge bosons at hadron collider machines (Tevatron, LHC) in a minimal D-brane model consisting out of four stacks of D-branes. In this construction, there are two massive gauge bosons, which can be naturally associated with baryon number B and B-L (L being lepton number). Here baryon number is always anomalous in four dimensions, whereas the presence of a four-dimensional B-L anomaly depends on the U(1)-charges of the right handed neutrinos. In case B-L is anomaly free, a mass hierarchy between the two associated Z'-gauge bosons can be explained. In our phenomenological discussion about the possible discovery of massive Z'-gauge bosons, we take as a benchmark scenario the dijet plus W signal, recently observed by the CDF Collaboration at Tevatron. It reveals an excess in the dijet mass range 150 GeV/c2, 4.1letter beyond SM expectations. We show that in the context of low-mass string theory this excess can be associated with the production and decay of a leptophobic Z', a singlet partner of SU(3) gluons coupled primarily to baryon number. Even if the CDF signal disappears, as indicated by the more recent D0 results, our analysis can still serve as the basis for future experimental search for massive Z'-gauge bosons in low string scale models.

Simple power counting arguments indicate that this system is over-occupied: the gluon occupation number is parametrically large when compared to a system in thermal equilibrium with the same energy density. On short time scales, soft elastic scatterings tend to drive the system towards the formation of a Bose--Einstein condensate that contains a large fraction of the gluons while contributing little to the energy density. The lifetime and existence of this condensate depends on whether inelastic processes, that occur on the same time scale as the elastic ones, preferably increase or decrease the number of gluons. During this overpopulated stage, and all the way to thermalization, the system behaves as a strongly interacting fluid, even though the elementary coupling constant is small.

Our point is that composite Higgs models where electroweak symmetry breaking arises via a strongly first-order phase transition provide a well-motivated framework for cold baryogenesis. In this case, reheating proceeds by bubble collisions and we argue that this can induce changes in Chern-Simons number, which in the presence of new sources of CP violation commonly lead to baryogenesis. We illustrate this mechanism using as a source of CP violation an effective dimension-six operator which is free from EDM constraints, another advantage of cold baryogenesis compared to the standard theory of electroweak baryogenesis. Our results are general as they do not rely on any particular UV completion but only on a stage of supercooling ended by a first-order phase transition in the evolution of the universe, which can be natural if there is nearly conformal dynamics at the TeV scale.

For homogeneous initial conditions the entanglement entropy thermalizes slowest, and sets a timescale for equilibration that saturates a causality bound over the range of scales studied. The growth rate of entanglement entropy density is nearly volume-independent for small volumes, but slows for larger volumes.",11,"['hep-ph', 'nucl-th']",4

The Euclidean path integral is formulated as a sum over geometries, including both perturbative loop corrections and non-perturbative instanton corrections coming from geometries with non-trivial topology. These non-trivial geometries have a natural physical interpretation. Conventional wisdom states that the sphere is the unique Euclidean continuation of de Sitter space. However, when considering physics only in the causal patch of a single observer other Euclidean geometries, in this case lens spaces, contribute to physical observables. This induces quantum gravitational effects which lead to deviations from the standard thermal behaviour obtained by analytic continuation from the three sphere. The sum over these geometries can be formulated as a sum over cosets of the modular group; this is the de Sitter analog of the celebrated ""black hole Farey tail."" We compute the vacuum partition function including the sum over these geometries. Perturbative quantum corrections are computed to all orders in perturbation theory using the relationship between Einstein gravity and Chern-Simons theory, which is checked explicitly at tree and one-loop level using heat kernel techniques.

In this way an important class of low-energy theorems for correlators of different operators with the trace of the energy-momentum tensor is established, which so far has been studied in field theory only. Another low-energy relationship, the so-called decoupling theorem, is numerically shown to hold universally in three holographic models involving both the quark and the gluon condensate.

The D7-branes are then wrapped over a 4-cycle on T2/Z2 x T2/Z2 which turns on all F1, F3, H3, and F5 fluxes of type IIB theory and induces torsion.

The internal space normal to the wrapped D7-branes at the infrared boundary is S1 whose radius is set by the nonperturbative scale of the gauge theory and spacetime is R1,3 at the ultraviolet boundary. The gauge coupling of the four-dimensional gauge theory is related to the gauge coupling of the eight-dimensional gauge theory and the volume of the 4-cycle. The gravity theory reproduces the renormalization group flow and the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking of the gauge theory and leads to confinement. The curvature is small and nearly constant and the supergravity flow is smooth in the infrared region where the gauge theory is strongly coupled and a dual gravity description is useful.

Since then, a great deal of evidence has been accumulated which suggests that the ABJM theory is integrable in the planar limit. Integrability is a very useful property that allows many physical observables, such as anomalous dimensions and scattering amplitudes, to be computed efficiently. In the first half of this thesis, we will explain how to use integrabilty to compute the anomalous dimensions of long, single-trace operators in the ABJM theory.

The latter approach involves using algebraic curve and world-sheet techniques to compute the energies of string states dual to gauge theory operators. In the second half of this thesis, we will discuss integrability from the point of view of on-shell scattering amplitudes in the ABJM theory. In particular, we will describe how to parameterize the amplitudes in terms of supertwistors and how to relate higher-point tree-level amplitudes to lower-point tree-level amplitudes using a recursion relation.

We analyze the recently introduced supersymmetric extensions of the light-like Wilson loop (formulated in Minkowski space-time) and demonstrate that they have the required symmetry properties at the classical level only, up to terms proportional to field equations of motion. At the quantum level, due to the specific light-cone singularities of the Wilson loop, the equations of motion produce a nontrivial finite contribution which breaks some of the classical symmetries. As a result, the quantum corrections violate the chiral supersymmetry already at one loop, thus invalidating the conjectured duality between Wilson loops and non-MHV scattering amplitudes.

This case includes and generalizes recently proposed String Theory inspired models of Inflation based on Axion Monodromy. The models we study have the property that the 2-point function oscillates as a function of the wavenumber, leading to oscillations in the CMB power spectrum. The non-linear realization of time diffeomorphisms induces some self-interactions for the Goldstone boson that lead to a peculiar non-Gaussianity whose shape oscillates as a function of the wavenumber. We find that in the regime of validity of the effective theory, the oscillatory signal contained in the n-point correlation functions, with n>2, is smaller than the one contained in the 2-point function, implying that the signature of oscillations, if ever detected, will be easier to find first in the 2-point function, and only then in the higher order correlation functions. Still the signal contained in higher-order correlation functions, that we study here in generality, could be detected at a subleading level, providing a very compelling consistency check for an approximate discrete shift symmetry being realized during inflation.",11,"['astro-ph', 'gr-qc', 'hep-ph']",4

The parity violating shape does not contribute to the bispectrum [1106.3228, 1108.0175], even though it is present in the wavefunction.

1105.5616,hep-th,"If a system falls through a black hole horizon, then its information is lost to an observer at infinity. But we argue that the \it accessible information is lost \it before the horizon is crossed. The temperature of the hole limits information carrying signals from a system that has fallen too close to the horizon. Extremal holes have T=0, but there is a minimum energy required to emit a quantum in the short proper time left before the horizon is crossed. If we attempt to bring the system back to infinity for observation, then acceleration radiation destroys the information. All three considerations give a critical distance from the horizon equation, where equation is the horizon radius and equation is the energy scale characterizing the system. For systems in string theory where we pack information as densely as possible, this acceleration constraint is found to have a geometric interpretation. These estimates suggest that in theories of gravity we should measure information not as a quantity contained inside a given system, but in terms of how much of that information can be reliably accessed by another observer.",11,['gr-qc'],4

Indeed, working in a Weyl space, using the Weyl covariant derivative and the intrinsic Weylian geometrical tensors, all conformally homogeneous operators will be conformally invariant, as will the equations they determine. A Weyl space is defined by two independent objects: the metric tensor equation and the Weyl vector equation. A simple procedure allows us to go from a Weyl space into a Riemann space by imposing the Weyl vector to be a gradient.

The negative of this quantity is equal to the finite part of the free energy of the Euclidean CFT on the three-sphere, and it has been proposed to satisfy the so called F-theorem, which states that it decreases under RG flow and is stationary at RG fixed points.

1107.5041,hep-th,"We construct a theory of fields living on continuous geometries with fractional Hausdorff and spectral dimensions, focussing on a flat background analogous to Minkowski spacetime. After reviewing the properties of fractional spaces with fixed dimension, presented in a companion paper, we generalize to a multi-fractional scenario inspired by multi-fractal geometry, where the dimension changes with the scale. This is related to the renormalization group properties of fractional field theories, illustrated by the example of a scalar field. Depending on the symmetries of the Lagrangian, one can define two models. In one of them, the effective dimension flows from 2 in the ultraviolet (UV) and geometry constrains the infrared limit to be four-dimensional. At the UV critical value, the model is rendered power-counting renormalizable. However, this is not the most fundamental regime. Compelling arguments of fractal geometry require an extension of the fractional action measure to complex order. In doing so, we obtain a hierarchy of scales characterizing different geometric regimes. At very small scales, discrete symmetries emerge and the notion of a continuous spacetime begins to blur, until one reaches a fundamental scale and an ultra-microscopic fractal structure. This fine hierarchy of geometries has implications for non-commutative theories and discrete quantum gravity. In the latter case, the present model can be viewed as a top-down realization of a quantum-discrete to classical-continuum transition.",11,"['gr-qc', 'math-ph', 'math']",4

We have tested these conjectures on the horizons of all four-charged rotating black hole solutions of ungauged supergravity theories and find that they always hold. They continue to hold in the the presence of a negative cosmological constant, and for multi-charged rotating solutions in gauged supergravity. Surprisingly, they also hold for the Ernst-Wild static black holes immersed in a magnetic field, which are asymptotic to the Melvin solution. In five spacetime dimensions we define equation as the least maximal area of all sweepouts of the horizon by two-dimensional tori, and find in all cases examined that equation, which we conjecture holds quiet generally for apparent horizons. In even spacetime dimensions equation, we find that for sweepouts by the product equation, equation is bounded from above by a certain dimension-dependent multiple of the energy equation.

It turns out that the Lie bracket system directly reveals the optimizing behavior of the extremum seeking system. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical foundation and prove that uniform asymptotic stability of the Lie bracket system implies practical uniform asymptotic stability of the corresponding extremum seeking system. We use the established results in order to prove local and semi-global practical uniform asymptotic stability of the extrema of a certain map for multi-agent extremum seeking systems.",11,[],0
1110.5542,math,"Tannaka Duality describes the relationship between algebraic objects in a given category and their representations; an important case is that of Hopf algebras and their categories of representations; these have strong monoidal forgetful ""fibre functors"" to the category of vector spaces. We simultaneously generalize the theory of Tannaka duality in two ways: first, we replace Hopf algebras with weak Hopf algebras and strong monoidal functors with separable Frobenius monoidal functors; second, we replace the category of vector spaces with an arbitrary braided monoidal category. To accomplish this goal, we introduce a new graphical notation for functors between monoidal categories, using string diagrams with coloured regions. Not only does this notation extend our capacity to give simple proofs of complicated calculations, it makes plain some of the connections between Frobenius monoidal or separable Frobenius monoidal functors and the topology of the axioms defining certain algebraic structures. Finally, having generalized Tannaka to an arbitrary base category, we briefly discuss the functoriality of the construction as this base is varied.",11,[],0

This entails, as a preliminary step, ascertaining sets of test functions that determine the operator, as well as the derivation of a corresponding reconstruction scheme. In the present paper we exploit a recent breakthrough in the theory of stable polynomials to solve the stated inverse problem completely.

1102.5556,math-ph,"In this report we discuss the organization of different levels of nature and the corresponding space-time structures by the consideration of a particular problem of time irreversibility. The fundamental time irreversibility problem consists in the following: how to reconcile the time-reversible microscopic dynamics and the irreversible macroscopic one. The recently proposed functional formulation of mechanics is aimed to solve this problem. The basic concept of this formulation is not a material point and a trajectory, like in the traditional formulation of mechanics, but a probability density function. Even if we deal with a single particle (not with an ensemble of particles), we describe its state as a probability density function. We justify this approach using measurement theory. A particular problem in the framework of the irreversibility problem is the derivation of the Boltzmann kinetic equation from the equations of microscopic dynamics. We propose a procedure for obtaining the Boltzmann equation from the Liouville equation based on the BBGKY hierarchy, the recently proposed functional formulation of classical mechanics, and the distinguishing between two scales of space-time, i.e., macro- and microscale. The notion of a space-time structure is introduced. It takes into account not only the space-time itself (i.e., a pseudo-Riemannian manifold), but also a characteristic length and time. The space-time structures form a hierarchy in sense that the initial values for the processes on the microscopic space-time structure (interactions of the particles) are assigned from the processes on the macroscopic one (kinetic phenomena).",11,"['cond-mat', 'math']",3

I show the steps toward the derivation of the equations for some of the models concerned. I study the infrared and ultraviolet limits and discuss the numerical approach. Higher rank integrals of motion can be obtained, so gaining some control on the eigenvectors. After, I discuss the Hubbard model in relation to the N = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory. The Hubbard model describes hopping electrons on a lattice.   In the second part, I present an evolutionary model based on Turing machines. The goal is to describe aspects of the real biological evolution, or Darwinism, by letting evolve populations of algorithms. Particularly, with this model one can study the mutual transformation of coding/non coding parts in a genome or the presence of an error threshold. The assembly of oligomeric proteins is an important phenomenon which interests the majority of proteins in a cell. I participated to the creation of the project ""Gemini"" which has for purpose the investigation of the structural data of the interfaces of such proteins. The objective is to differentiate the role of amino acids and determine the presence of patterns characterizing certain geometries.",11,"['math', 'q-bio']",3
1109.4824,math-ph,"We provide a model independent construction of a net of C*-algebras satisfying the Haag-Kastler axioms over any spacetime manifold. Such a net, called the net of causal loops, is constructed by selecting a suitable base K encoding causal and symmetry properties of the spacetime. Considering K as a partially ordered set (poset) with respect to the inclusion order relation, we define groups of closed paths (loops) formed by the elements of K. These groups come equipped with a causal disjointness relation and an action of the symmetry group of the spacetime. In this way the local algebras of the net are the group C*-algebras of the groups of loops, quotiented by the causal disjointness relation. We also provide a geometric interpretation of a class of representations of this net in terms of causal and covariant connections of the poset K. In the case of the Minkowski spacetime, we prove the existence of Poincar\'e covariant representations satisfying the spectrum condition. This is obtained by virtue of a remarkable feature of our construction: any Hermitian scalar quantum field defines causal and covariant connections of K. Similar results hold for the chiral spacetime equation with conformal symmetry.",11,"['hep-th', 'math']",3

Following this, we prove that the global attractor of this model takes one of two forms. When coupling strength is below a critical value, the global attractor is a single equilibrium point corresponding to an incoherent state. Conversely, when coupling strength is beyond this critical value, the global attractor is a two-dimensional disk composed of radial trajectories connecting a saddle equilibrium (the incoherent state) to an invariant closed curve of locally stable equilibria (partially synchronized state). Our analysis hinges, on the one hand, upon sharp existence and uniqueness results and their consequence for the existence of a global attractor, and, on the other hand, on the study of the dynamics in the vicinity of the incoherent and synchronized equilibria.

1110.5754,nlin,We consider light transmission in 2D photonic crystal waveguide coupled with two identical nonlinear defects positioned symmetrically aside the waveguide. We show that with growth of injected light power there is a breaking of symmetry by two ways. In the first way the symmetry is broken because of different light intensities at the defects. In the second way the intensities at the defects are equaled but phases of complex amplitudes are different. That results in a vortical power flow between the defects similar to the DC Josephson effect if the input power over the waveguide is applied and the defects are coupled. As application of these phenomena we consider the symmetry breaking for the light transmission in a T-shaped photonic waveguide with two nonlinear defects. We demonstrate as this phenomenon can be explored for all-optical switching of light transmission from the left output waveguide to the right one by application of input pulses. Finally we consider the symmetry breaking in the waveguide coupled with single defect presented however by two dipole modes.,11,['cond-mat'],9

This allows us to explicitly illustrate the functional Taylor expansion formalism recently proposed for this kind of systems. The Taylor expansion reveals particularly useful to obtain the shape of the current when the force is periodic, piecewise constant. We also illustrate the somewhat counterintuitive effect that introducing damping may induce a ratchet effect. When the force is symmetric under time-reversal and the system is undamped, under symmetry principles no ratchet effect is possible. In this situation increasing damping generates a ratchet current which, upon increasing the damping coefficient eventually reaches a maximum and decreases toward zero.

These equations have elegant analytical solutions that replace the complex integro-differential motion equations by simple differential equations of pole motion in a complex plane. The main problem with such a solution is the existence of finite time singularities. To prevent such singularities, nonzero surface tension is usually used.However, nonzero surface tension does not exist in filtration combustion, and this destroys the analytical solutions. However, a more elegant approach exists for solving the problem. First, we can introduce a small amount of pole noise to the system. Second, for regularisation of the problem, we throw out all new poles that can produce a finite time singularity. It can be strictly proved that the asymptotic solution for such a system is a single finger. Moreover, the qualitative consideration demonstrates that a finger with 1/2 of the channel width is statistically stable. Therefore, all properties of such a solution are exactly the same as those of the solution with nonzero surface tension under numerical noise.

1105.5228,nlin,"Lyapunov exponents are well-known characteristic numbers that describe growth rates of perturbations applied to a trajectory of a dynamical system in different state space directions. Covariant (or characteristic) Lyapunov vectors indicate these directions. Though the concept of these vectors has been known for a long time, they became practically computable only recently due to algorithms suggested by Ginelli et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 2007, 130601] and by Wolfe and Samelson [Tellus 59A, 2007, 355]. In view of the great interest in covariant Lyapunov vectors and their wide range of potential applications, in this article we summarize the available information related to Lyapunov vectors and provide a detailed explanation of both the theoretical basics and numerical algorithms. We introduce the notion of adjoint covariant Lyapunov vectors. The angles between these vectors and the original covariant vectors are norm-independent and can be considered as characteristic numbers. Moreover, we present and study in detail an improved approach for computing covariant Lyapunov vectors. Also we describe, how one can test for hyperbolicity of chaotic dynamics without explicitly computing covariant vectors.",11,[],9

1108.0122,nlin,"In this paper, based on the regular KdV system, we study negative order KdV (NKdV) equations about their Hamiltonian structures, Lax pairs, infinitely many conservation laws, and explicit multi-soliton and multi-kink wave solutions thorough bilinear Backlund transformations. The NKdV equations studied in our paper are differential and actually derived from the first member in the negative order KdV hierarchy. The NKdV equations are not only gauge-equivalent to the Camassa-Holm equation through some hodograph transformations, but also closely related to the Ermakov-Pinney systems, and the Kupershmidt deformation. The bi-Hamiltonian structures and a Darboux transformation of the NKdV equations are constructed with the aid of trace identity and their Lax pairs, respectively. The single and double kink wave and bell soliton solutions are given in an explicit formula through the Darboux transformation. The 1-kink wave solution is expressed in the form of equation while the 1-bell soliton is in the form of equation, and both forms are very standard. The collisions of 2-kink-wave and 2-bell-soliton solutions, are analyzed in details, and this singular interaction is a big difference from the regular KdV equation. Multi-dimensional binary Bell polynomials are employed to find bilinear formulation and Backlund transformations, which produce equation-soliton solutions. A direct and unifying scheme is proposed for explicitly building up quasi-periodic wave solutions of the NKdV equations.   Furthermore, the relations between quasi-periodic wave solutions and soliton solutions are clearly described. Finally, we show the quasi-periodic wave solution convergent to the soliton solution under some limit conditions.",11,[],9

Furthermore, completeness relations for the 'squared solutions' (generalized exponentials) are derived. Next, expansions of the potential and its variation are obtained. This demonstrates that the interpretation of the inverse scattering method as a generalized Fourier transform holds true.

1107.5628,nlin,"Experimental results for passive tracer dispersion in the turbulent surface layer under stable conditions are presented. In this case, the dispersion of tracer particles is determined by the interplay of three mechanisms: relative dispersion (celebrated Richardson's mechanism), shear dispersion (particle separation due to variation of the mean velocity field) and specific surface-layer dispersion (induced by the gradient of the energy dissipation rate in the turbulent surface layer). The latter mechanism results in the rather slow (ballistic) law for the mean squared particle separation. Based on a simplified Langevin equation for particle separation we found that the ballistic regime always dominates at large times. This conclusion is supported by our extensive atmospheric observations. Exit-time statistics are derived from the experimental dataset and show a reasonable match with the simple dimensional asymptotes for different mechanisms of tracer dispersion, as well as predictions of the multifractal model and experimental data from other sources.",11,['physics'],9

Consideration of both types of three-wave interactions can generically explain the presence of complex patterns and spatio-temporal chaos.

The radius of the vortices increases linearly with their topological charge, equation, therefore the flat-stripe soliton may be interpreted as the vortex with equation, while vortex solitons can be realized as stripes bent into rings. The results for the vortex solitons are applicable to a broad class of physical systems.

To analyze the chaoticity of this system, we construct a matrix of the length of trajectories and perform a level spacing analysis of the spectrum of this matrix. We find that a universal behavior occurs both in level spacing distribution and spectral rigidity. In order to examine diffusion in this classical system, we investigate the variance of the length of trajectories versus number of collisions to disks.

The network of clips changes dynamically, both due to new perceptual input and due to certain compositional principles of the simulation process. During simulation, the clips are screened for specific features which trigger factual action of the agent.

It is known that when two systems are coupled directly, they can synchronize under suitable conditions. When an indirect feedback coupling through an environment or an external system is introduced in them, it is found to induce a tendency for anti-synchronization. We show that, for sufficient strengths, these two competing effects can lead to amplitude death. We provide a general stability analysis that gives the threshold values for onset of amplitude death. We study in detail the nature of the transition to death in several specific cases and find that the transitions can be of two types - continuous and discontinuous. By choosing a variety of dynamics for example, periodic, chaotic, hyper chaotic, and time-delay systems, we illustrate that this mechanism is quite general and works for different types of direct coupling, such as diffusive, replacement, and synaptic couplings and for different damped dynamics of the environment.",11,[],9

1108.4204,nlin,"Dynamical systems that are invariant under the action of a non-trivial symmetry group can possess structurally stable heteroclinic cycles. In this paper we study stability properties of a class of structurally stable heteroclinic cycles in Rn which we call heteroclinic cycles of type Z. It is well-known that a heteroclinic cycle that is not asymptotically stable can attract nevertheless a positive measure set from its neighbourhood. We say that an invariant set X is fragmentarily asymptotically stable, if for any delta>0 the measure of its local basin of attraction Bdelta(X) is positive. A local basin of attraction Bdelta(X) is the set of such points that trajectories starting there remain in the delta-neighbourhood of X for all t>0, and are attracted by X as t\to\infty. Necessary and sufficient conditions for fragmentary asymptotic stability are expressed in terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of transition matrices. If all transverse eigenvalues of linearisations near steady states involved in the cycle are negative, then fragmentary asymptotic stability implies asymptotic stability. In the latter case the condition for asymptotic stability is that the transition matrices have an eigenvalue larger than one in absolute value. Finally, we discuss bifurcations occurring when the conditions for asymptotic stability or for fragmentary asymptotic stability are broken.",11,[],9

The combination of geometric and probabilistic methods allows us to design regions of control that provide an increase in loitering time while minimizing the amount of control actuation.

The magnitude of the mean flow is adjusted via a real and continuous parameter that accounts for the fluid boundary conditions on the horizontal surfaces in a convecting layer. For weak values of the mean flow we find that the patterns exhibit a slow coarsening to a state dominated by large and very slowly moving target defects. For strong enough mean flow we identify the existence of spatiotemporal chaos which is indicated by a positive leading order Lyapunov exponent.

Applying expansions over the symplectic basis of squared eigenfunctions, the integrability properties of the KdV hierarchy with generic self-consistent sources are analyzed. This allows one to formulate a set of conditions on the perturbation terms that preserve the integrability. The perturbation corrections to the scattering data and to the corresponding action-angle variables are studied. The analysis shows that although many nontrivial solutions of KdV equations with generic self-consistent sources can be obtained by the Inverse Scattering Transform (IST), there are solutions that, in principle, can not be obtained via IST.

Here, we analyze the correlations between the lower and higher order bulk characteristic parameters within the framework of Skyrme Hartree-Fock energy density functional and then estimate the values of some higher order bulk characteristic parameters.

An analytic extraction using single component wave functions (SCA) with the quark current being reduced to its nonrelativistic Pauli form is employed in the first method. In the second method, the form factors are extracted numerically using the full quark model wave function (MCN) with the full relativistic form of the quark current. Although there are differences between the two sets of form factors, both sets satisfy the relationships expected from the heavy quark effective theory (HQET). Differential decay rates, branching ratios and forward-backward asymmetries (FBAs) are calculated for the dileptonic decays equation, for transitions to both ground state and excited daughter baryons. Inclusion of the long distance contributions from charmonium resonances significantly enhances the decay rates.

The model is applied to describe the shell evolution in a chain of superheavy isotopes equation120 and finds a rather stable proton spherical shell closure at Z = 120.

Obtained thereby, the e.m. interactions of baryons are typically described by hard form factors. In contrasting this behaviour with that produced by a momentum-dependent interaction, one achieves comparisons which highlight that elastic scattering and resonance electroproduction experiments probe the infrared evolution of QCD's running masses; e.g., the existence, and location if so, of a zero in the ratio of nucleon Sachs form factors are strongly influenced by the running of the dressed-quark mass. In our description of baryons, diquark correlations are important. These correlations are instrumental in producing a zero in the Dirac form factor of the proton's d-quark; and in determining dv/uv(x=1), as we show via a formula that expresses dv/uv(x=1) in terms of the nucleon's diquark content. The contact interaction produces a first excitation of the nucleon that is constituted predominantly from axial-vector diquark correlations. This impacts greatly on the gamma*p->P11(1440) form factors. Notably, our quark core contribution to F2*(Q2) exhibits a zero at Q2~0.5mN2. Faddeev equation treatments of a hadron's quark core usually underestimate its magnetic properties, hence we consider the effect produced by a dressed-quark anomalous e.m. moment. Its inclusion much improves agreement with experiment.

A number of experimentally measurable observables such as parallel momentum distributions, proton angular distributions and total breakup cross sections are calculated. With respect to nuclear breakup it is found that a proton behaves exactly as a neutron of larger binding energy. The extra 'effective energy' is due to the combined core-target Coulomb barrier. In Coulomb breakup we distinguish the effect of the core-target Coulomb potential (called recoil effect), with respect to which the proton behaves again as a more bound neutron, from the direct proton-target Coulomb potential. The latter gives cross sections about an order of magnitude larger than the recoil term. The two effects give rise to complicated interferences in the parallel momentum distributions.

It is found that the number of reactions without radial fusion hindrance is much smaller than that without neck fusion hindrance, and for both kinds of fusion hindrance the number of reactions without fusion hindrance at small mass-asymmetry parameter equation is smaller than that at large equation.

The cross section letter a2, where a is determined in such a way as to reproduce the empirical proton diffraction peak angle in the elastic channel, is known to agree with empirical total reaction cross sections for incident protons to within error bars. By comparing the inelastic diffraction patterns obtained in the Fraunhofer approximation with the experimental ones, one can likewise derive the black sphere radius al for the excited state with spin l. We find that for 12C, 58,60,62,64Ni, and 208Pb, the value of al obtained from the inelastic channel is generally larger than the value of a from the elastic channel and tends to increase with the excitation energy.

The high density phase of this matter in the presence of a magnetic field is known to be the Magnetic Color-Flavor-Locked (MCFL) phase of color superconductivity. We derive the Fierz identities of the theory and show how the explicit breaking of the rotational symmetry by the uniform magnetic field field opens new channels of interactions and allows the formation of a new diquark condensate. The new order parameter is a spin-1 diquark condensate proportional to the component in the field direction of the average magnetic moment of the pairs of charged quarks. In the region of large fields, the new condensate's magnitude becomes comparable to the larger of the two scalar gaps. Since there is no solution of the gap equations with nonzero scalar gaps and zero value of this magnetic moment condensate, its presence in the MCFL phase is unavoidable. This is consistent with the fact that the extra condensate does not break any symmetry that has not already been broken by the known MCFL gaps. The spin-1 condensate enhances the condensation energy of pairs formed by charged quarks and the magnetization of the system. We discuss the possible consequences of the new order parameter on the issue of the chromomagnetic instability that appears in color superconductivity at moderate density.",11,['hep-ph'],11

Using the fission-like model it was shown that most of the SHE-nuclei lie in the region where the pionic fissility parameters attain their limiting value X=1 (see Fig.2-3). Hence, the SHE-region is characterized by the absence of a classical barrier toward spontaneous pion emission. Consequently, both decay modes, the pionic fission and the spontaneous fission of SHE nuclides, essentially will be determined only by shell effects. Then, it was seen that the usual predicted SHE-island of stability around the double magic nucleus 298-[114], which is not confirmed experimentally, can be explained by the dominant pionic radioactivity of the SHE-nuclei from this region.

During the hydrodynamic stage, the production of lepton pairs is described by radiation rates for a strongly interacting medium in thermal equilibrium. In the low mass region, hadronic thermal emission is evaluated assuming vector meson dominance including in-medium modifications of the rho meson spectral function through scattering from nucleons and pions in the heat bath. In the intermediate mass region, the hadronic rate is essentially determined by multi-pion annihilation processes. Emission from quark-antiquark annihilation in the quark gluon plasma is taken into account as well. When the system is sufficiently dilute, the hydrodynamic description breaks down and a transition to a final cascade stage is performed. In this stage dimuon emission is evaluated as commonly done in transport models. Focusing on the enhancement with respect to the contribution from long-lived hadron decays after freezout observed at the SPS in the low mass region of the dilepton spectra, the relative importance of the different thermal contributions and of the two dynamical stages is investigated. We find that three separated regions can be identified in the invariant mass spectra. Whereas the very low and the intermediate mass regions mostly receive contribution from the thermal dilepton emission, the region around the vector meson peak is dominated by the cascade emission. Above the rho-peak region the spectrum is driven by QGP radiation.

However, practical applications that typically retain only a few leading terms may suffer from unacceptable loss of accuracy in the near-field. We propose an alternative approach for approximating electrostatic charge distributions, Optimal Physical Multipoles (OPMs), which optimally represent the original charge distribution with a set of point charges. By construction, approximation of electrostatic potential based on OPMs retains many of the useful properties of the corresponding point multipole expansion, including the same asymptotic behavior of the approximate potential for a given multipole order. At the same time, OPMs can be significantly more accurate in the near field: up to 5 times more accurate for some of the charge distributions tested here which are relevant to biomolecular modeling. Unlike point multipoles, for point charge distributions the OPM always converges to the original point charge distribution at finite order. Furthermore, OPMs may be more computationally efficient and easier to implement into existing molecular simulations software packages than approximation schemes based on point multipoles. In addition to providing a general framework for computing OPMs to any order, closed-form expressions for the lowest order OPMs (monopole and dipole) are derived.

1106.0297,physics,The map of a city's streets constitutes a particular case of spatial complex network. However a city is not limited to its topology: it is above all a geometrical object whose particularity is to organize into short and long axes called streets. In this article we present and discuss two algorithms aiming at recovering the notion of street from a graph representation of a city. Then we show that the length of the so-called streets scales logarithmically. This phenomenon leads to assume that a city is shaped into a logic of extension and division of space.,11,['cs'],5
1112.5989,physics,"We present enhancements to the computational efficiency of exact exchange calculations using the density matrix and local support functions. We introduce a numerical method which avoids the explicit calculation the four-center two-electron repulsion integrals and reduces the prefactor scaling by a factor N, where N is the number of atoms within the range of the exact exchange Hamiltonian. This approach is based on a contraction-reduction scheme, and takes advantage of the discretization space which enables the direct summation over the support functions in a localized space. Using the sparsity property of the density matrix, the scaling of the prefactor can be further reduced to reach asymptotically O(N).",11,['cond-mat'],5
1102.3514,physics,"We analyze numerically the correspondence between the mechanical action, experienced by a spherical microparticle, and the internal energy flows as well as spatial and polarization inhomogeneity of the light field incident on the particle. The inhomogeneous incident field is modelled by superposition of two plane waves, the mechanical action is calculated via the Mie theory for dielectric and conducting particles of different sizes and optical properties. It is shown that both spin and orbital components of the field momentum can produce the mechanical action, which can thus be used for experimental study of the internal energy flows in light beams. However, exact value and even direction of the force applied to a particle depends on many details of the field-particle interaction. Besides, forces that are not associated with any sort of the energy flow (we attribute them to the gradient force owing to the inhomogeneous intensity and to the dipole force emerging due to inhomogeneous polarization) can strongly modify the observed mechanical action. The results should be taken into account in experiments employing the motion of probing particles suspended within optical fields. We suppose that situations where an optical field exerts the polarization-dependent mechanical action on particles can be treated as a new form of the spin-orbit interaction of light.",11,[],5

1106.4445,physics,"Dual phospho/dephosphorylation cycles, as well as covalent enzymatic-catalyzed modifications of substrates, are widely diffused within cellular systems and are crucial for the control of complex responses such as learning, memory and cellular fate determination. Despite the large body of deterministic studies and the increasing work aimed to elucidate the effect of noise in such systems, some aspects remain unclear. Here we study the stationary distribution provided by the two-dimensional Chemical Master Equation for a well known model of a two step phospho/dephosphorylation cycle using the quasi steady state approximation of the enzymatic kinetics. Our aim is to analyze the role of fluctuations and the molecules distribution properties in the transition to a bistable regime. When detailed balance conditions are satisfied it is possible to compute equilibrium distributions in a closed and explicit form. When detailed balance is not satisfied, the stationary non-equilibrium state is strongly influenced by the chemical fluxes. In the last case, we show how the Helmholtz decomposition of the external field associated to the generation and recombination transition rates, into a conservative and a rotational (irreversible) part, allows to compute the stationary distribution via a perturbative approach . For a finite number of molecules, there exists diffusion dynamics in a macroscopic region of the state space, where a relevant transition rate between the two critical points is observed. Further, the stationary distribution function can be approximated by the solution of a Fokker-Planck equation.

The quasi-TEM nature of mode profiles reveals that the propagation of free electron oscillations on the top of the nano-ridge contributes mainly to the tightly confined ridge mode.

1105.5344,physics,"Considering a clique as a conservative definition of community structure, we examine how graph partitioning algorithms interact with cliques. Many popular community-finding algorithms partition the entire graph into non-overlapping communities. We show that on a wide range of empirical networks, from different domains, significant numbers of cliques are split across the separate partitions produced by these algorithms. We then examine the largest connected component of the subgraph formed by retaining only edges in cliques, and apply partitioning strategies that explicitly minimise the number of cliques split. We further examine several modern overlapping community finding algorithms, in terms of the interaction between cliques and the communities they find, and in terms of the global overlap of the sets of communities they find. We conclude that, due to the connectedness of many networks, any community finding algorithm that produces partitions must fail to find at least some significant structures. Moreover, contrary to traditional intuition, in some empirical networks, strong ties and cliques frequently do cross community boundaries; much community structure is fundamentally overlapping and unpartitionable in nature.",11,['cs'],5

1104.0878,physics,"The results of a theoretical investigation of the energy loss of charged particles in a magnetized classical plasma due to the electric field fluctuations are reported. The energy loss for a test particle is calculated through the linear-response theory. At vanishing magnetic field the electric field fluctuations lead to an energy gain of the charged particle for all velocities. It has been shown that in the presence of strong magnetic field this effect occurs only at low-velocities. In the opposite case of high-velocities the test particle systematically loses its energy due to the interaction with a stochastic electric field. The net effect of the fluctuations is the systematic reduction of the total energy loss (i.e. the sum of the polarization and stochastic energy losses) at vanishing magnetic field and reduction or enhancement at strong field depending on the velocity of the particle. It is found that the energy loss of the slow heavy ion contains an anomalous term which depends logarithmically on the projectile mass. The physical origin of this anomalous term is the coupling between the cyclotron motion of the plasma electrons and the long-wavelength, low-frequency fluctuations produced by the projectile ion. This effect may strongly enhance the stochastic energy gain of the particle.",11,[],5

The trailing secondary vortex tubes are formed as the result of interaction between the vortex ring and the LV wall. These vortex tubes wrap around the circumference and begin to interact with and destabilize the mitral vortex ring. At the end of diastole, the vortex ring impinges on the LV wall and the large-scale intraventricular flow rotates in clockwise direction.

It is based on the explicit treatment of a fraction of multideterminantal exact exchange. The connection with conventional double hybrids is made when neglecting density scaling in the correlation functional as well as second-order corrections to the density. In this context, the fraction ac of second-order M\oller-Plesset (MP2) correlation energy is not necessarily equal to the square of the fraction ax of Hartree-Fock exchange. More specifically, it is shown that ac \leq ax2, a condition that conventional semi-empirical double hybrids actually fulfill. In addition, a new procedure for calculating the orbitals, which has a better justification than the one routinely used, is proposed. Referred to as letter1 variant, the corresponding double hybrid approximation has been tested on a small set consisting of H2, N2, Be2, Mg2, and Ar2. Three conventional double hybrids (B2-PLYP, B2GP-PLYP, and PBE0-DH) have been considered. Potential curves obtained with letter1- and regular double hybrids can, in some cases, differ significantly. In particular, for the weakly bound dimers, the letter1 variants bind systematically more than the regular ones, which is an improvement in many but not all cases.

Differences in electric potential and the induced magnetic field are also measured to characterize the magnetohydrodynamic flow. Rotation frequencies of the inner sphere are varied between -30 Hz and 30 Hz, the magnetic Reynolds number based on measured sodium velocities and on the shell radius reaching to about 33.

1109.2459,physics,"We propose a general strategy for determining the minimal finite amplitude isturbance to trigger transition to turbulence in shear flows. This involves constructing a variational problem that searches over all disturbances of fixed initial amplitude, which respect the boundary conditions, incompressibility and the Navier--Stokes equations, to maximise a chosen functional over an asymptotically long time period. The functional must be selected such that it identifies turbulent velocity fields by taking significantly enhanced values compared to those for laminar fields. We illustrate this approach using the ratio of the final to initial perturbation kinetic energies (energy growth) as the functional and the energy norm to measure amplitudes in the context of pipe flow. Our results indicate that the variational problem yields a smooth converged solution providing the amplitude is below the threshold amplitude for transition. This optimal is the nonlinear analogue of the well-studied (linear) transient growth optimal. At and above this threshold, the optimising search naturally seeks out disturbances that trigger turbulence by the end of the period, and convergence is then practically impossible. The first disturbance found to trigger turbulence as the amplitude is increased identifies the `minimal seed' for the given geometry and forcing (Reynolds number). We conjecture that it may be possible to select a functional such that the converged optimal below threshold smoothly converges to the minimal seed at threshold. This seems at least approximately true for our choice of energy growth functional and the pipe flow geometry chosen here.",11,[],5

Image inputs to the model are modulated by long-range horizontal connections, allowing contextual effects in the image to determine visual saliency, i.e. line segments arranged in a closed contour elicit a larger neural response than line segments forming background clutter. The model is tested on 3 types of contour, including a line, a circular closed contour, and a non-circular closed contour. Using a modified association field to describe horizontal connections the model is found to perform well for different parameter values. For each type of contour a different facilitation mechanism is found.

Alternatively, operating as a feedback network, the model can achieve further improvement over several iterations through cooperative interactions.

1110.3307,physics,"We take our world to be an objective reality, but is it? The assumption that the physical world exists in and of itself has struggled to assimilate the findings of modern physics for some time now. For example, an objective space and time would just ""be"", but in relativity, space contracts and time dilates. Likewise objective ""things"" should just inherently exist, but the entities of quantum theory are probability of existence smears, that spread, tunnel, superpose and entangle in physically impossible ways. Cosmology even tells us that our entire physical universe just ""popped up"", from nowhere, about 14 billion years ago. This is not how an objectively real world should behave! Yet traditional alternatives don't work much better. That the world is just an illusion of the mind doesn't explain its consistent realism and Descartes dualism, that another reality beyond the physical exists, just doubles the existential problem. It is time to consider an option we might normally dismiss out of hand. This essay explores the virtual reality conjecture, that the physical world is the digital output of non-physical quantum processing. It finds it neither illogical, nor unscientific, nor incompatible with current physics. In this model, quantum entities are programs, movement is the transfer of processing, interactions are processing overloads and the fields of physics are network properties. It has no empty space, no singularities and all the conservations of physics just conserve processing. Its prediction, that the collision of high frequency light in a vacuum can create permanent matter, will test it. If the physical world has the properties of a processing output, physics must rewrite the story behind its equations.",11,[],5

The heterodimer is composed of two molecules modeled as two-level systems coupled by the resonance interaction. The system-bath coupling is taken into account as a modulating factor of the energy gap of the molecular excitation, while the relaxation to the ground state is treated phenomenologically. Comparison of the description of the excitation dynamics modeled using either the Redfield equations (secular and full forms) or the Hierarchical quantum master equation (HQME) is demonstrated and discussed. Possible role of the dimer as an excitation quenching center in photosynthesis self-regulation is discussed.

Simulations reveal the evolution of high-Mach-number (M), annular, spherical plasma flows during convergence, stagnation, shock formation, and disassembly, and indicate that cm- and letters-scale plasmas with peak pressures near 1 Mbar can be generated by liners with initial kinetic energy of several hundred kilo-joules. It is shown that radiation transport and thermal conduction must be included to avoid non-physical plasma temperatures at the origin which artificially limit liner convergence and thus the peak stagnation pressure. Scalings of the stagnated plasma lifetime (letterstag) and average stagnation pressure (Pstag, the pressure at the origin, averaged over letterstag) are determined by evaluating a wide range of liner initial conditions. For high-M flows, letterstag L0/v0, where L0 and v0 are the initial liner thickness and velocity, respectively. Furthermore, for argon liners, Pstag scales approximately as v0(15/4) over a wide range of initial densities (n0), and as n0(1/2) over a wide range of v0. The approximate scaling Pstag ~ M 3/2 is also found for a wide range of liner-plasma initial conditions.",11,[],5

1101.2519,physics,"Power transmission in one-dimensional nonlinear magnetic metamaterials driven at one end is investigated numerically and analytically in a wide frequency range. The nonlinear magnetic metamaterials are composed of varactor-loaded split-ring resonators which are coupled magnetically through their mutual inductances, forming thus a magnetoiductive transmission line. In the linear limit, significant power transmission along the array only appears for frequencies inside the linear magnetoinductive wave band. We present analytical, closed form solutions for the magnetoinductive waves transmitting the power in this regime, and their discrete frequency dispersion. When nonlinearity is important, more frequency bands with significant power transmission along the array may appear. In the equivalent circuit picture, the nonlinear magnetoiductive transmission line driven at one end by a relatively weak electromotive force, can be modeled by coupled resistive-inductive-capacitive (RLC) circuits with voltage-dependent capacitance. Extended numerical simulations reveal that power transmission along the array is also possible in other than the linear frequency bands, which are located close to the nonlinear resonances of a single nonlinear RLC circuit. Moreover, the effectiveness of power transmission for driving frequencies in the nonlinear bands is comparable to that in the linear band. Power transmission in the nonlinear bands occurs through the linear modes of the system, and it is closely related to the instability of a mode that is localized at the driven site.",11,['cond-mat'],5

At the initial stage, stable clusters of two opinions, A and B exist. Then we introduce contrarians which hold a strong B opinion into the opinion A group. Through their interactions, the contrarians are able to decrease the size of the largest A opinion cluster, and even destroy it. We see this kind of method in operation, e.g when companies send free new products to potential customers in order to convince them to adopt the product and influence others. We study the CO model, using two different strategies, on both ER and scale-free networks. In strategy I, the contrarians are positioned at random. In strategy II, the contrarians are chosen to be the highest degrees nodes. We find that for both strategies the size of the largest A cluster decreases to zero as p increases as in a phase transition. At a critical threshold value pc the system undergoes a second-order phase transition that belongs to the same universality class of mean field percolation. We find that even for an ER type model, where the degrees of the nodes are not so distinct, strategy II is significantly more effctive in reducing the size of the largest A opinion cluster and, at very small values of p, the largest A opinion cluster is destroyed.",11,['cs'],5

1111.6611,q-bio,"Actin networks, acting as an engine pushing against an external load, are fundamentally important to cell motility. A measure of the effectiveness of an engine is the velocity the engine is able to produce at a given force, the force-velocity curve. One type of force-velocity curve, consisting of a concave region where velocity is insensitive to increasing force followed by a decrease in velocity, is indicative of an adaptive response. In contrast, an engine whose velocity rapidly decays as a convex curve in response to increasing force would indicate a lack of adaptive response. Even taken outside of a cellular context, branching actin networks have been observed to exhibit both concave and convex force-velocity curves. The exact mechanism that can explain both force-velocity curves is not yet known. We carried out an agent-based stochastic simulation to explore such a mechanism. Our results suggest that upon loading, branching actin networks are capable of remodeling by increasing the number filaments growing against the load. Our model provides a mechanism that can account for both convex and concave force-velocity relationships observed in branching actin networks. Finally, our model gives a potential explanation to the experimentally observed force history dependence for actin network velocity.",11,[],10

In the first extinction route the predators go extinct first, whereas the prey thrive for a long time and then also go extinct. In the second route the prey go extinct first causing a rapid extinction of the predators. Assuming large sub-population sizes in the coexistence state, we compare the probabilities of each of the two extinction routes and predict the most likely path of the sub-populations to extinction.

1102.4570,q-bio,"In spatial evolutionary games the fitness of each individual is traditionally determined by the payoffs it obtains upon playing the game with its neighbors. Since defection yields the highest individual benefits, the outlook for cooperators is gloomy. While network reciprocity promotes collaborative efforts, chances of averting the impending social decline are slim if the temptation to defect is strong. It is therefore of interest to identify viable mechanisms that provide additional support for the evolution of cooperation. Inspired by the fact that the environment may be just as important as inheritance for individual development, we introduce a simple switch that allows a player to either keep its original payoff or use the average payoff of all its neighbors. Depending on which payoff is higher, the influence of either option can be tuned by means of a single parameter. We show that, in general, taking into account the environment promotes cooperation. Yet coveting the fitness of one's neighbors too strongly is not optimal. In fact, cooperation thrives best only if the influence of payoffs obtained in the traditional way is equal to that of the average payoff of the neighborhood. We present results for the prisoner's dilemma and the snowdrift game, for different levels of uncertainty governing the strategy adoption process, and for different neighborhood sizes.

To annotate protein functions as sets of interaction states at atomic resolution, and thereby to better understand the relation between protein interactions and biological functions, we conducted exhaustive all-against-all atomic structure comparisons of all known binding sites for ligands including small molecules, proteins and nucleic acids, and identified recurring elementary motifs. By integrating the elementary motifs associated with each subunit, we defined composite motifs which represent context-dependent combinations of elementary motifs. It is demonstrated that function similarity can be better inferred from composite motif similarity compared to the similarity of protein sequences or of individual binding sites. By integrating the composite motifs associated with each protein function, we define meta-composite motifs each of which is regarded as a time-independent diagrammatic representation of a biological process.

1105.3726,q-bio,"The response of complex networks to perturbations is of utmost importance in areas as diverse as ecosystem management, emergency response, and cell reprogramming. A fundamental property of networks is that the perturbation of one node can affect other nodes, in a process that may cause the entire or substantial part of the system to change behavior and possibly collapse. Recent research in metabolic and food-web networks has demonstrated the concept that network damage caused by external perturbations can often be mitigated or reversed by the application of compensatory perturbations. Compensatory perturbations are constrained to be physically admissible and amenable to implementation on the network. However, the systematic identification of compensatory perturbations that conform to these constraints remains an open problem. Here, we present a method to construct compensatory perturbations that can control the fate of general networks under such constraints. Our approach accounts for the full nonlinear behavior of real complex networks and can bring the system to a desirable target state even when this state is not directly accessible. Applications to genetic networks show that compensatory perturbations are effective even when limited to a small fraction of all nodes in the network and that they are far more effective when limited to the highest-degree nodes. The approach is conceptually simple and computationally efficient, making it suitable for the rescue, control, and reprogramming of large complex networks in various domains.",11,"['cond-mat', 'cs', 'nlin', 'physics']",10

The concentration of AMH in blood may also reflect the non-growing follicle (NGF) population, i.e. the ovarian reserve, and be of value in predicting reproductive lifespan. A full description of AMH production up to the menopause has not been reported. Methodology/Principal Findings: By searching the published literature for AMH concentrations in healthy pre-menopausal females, and using our own data (combined n = 3,260) we have generated and robustly validated the first model of AMH concentration from conception to menopause. This model shows that 34% of the variation in AMH is due to age alone. We have shown that AMH peaks at age 24.5 years, followed by a decline to the menopause. We have also shown that there is a neonatal peak and a potential pre-pubertal peak. Our model allows us to generate normative data at all ages. Conclusions/Significance: These data highlight key inflection points in ovarian follicle dynamics. This first validated model of circulating AMH in healthy females describes a transition period in early adulthood, after which AMH reflects the progressive loss of the NGF pool. The existence of a neonatal increase in gonadal activity is confirmed for females.

We perform event-driven simulations on finite-size networks with up to 128 neurons to find the stationary synaptic weight conformations for different values of the plasticity parameter. In both the low and high activity regimes, the synaptic weights are narrowly distributed around the plasticity parameter value consistent with the predictions of mean-field theory.

1104.3707,q-bio,"A statistically principled way of conducting weighted network analysis is still lacking. Comparison of different populations of weighted networks is hard because topology is inherently dependent on wiring cost, where cost is defined as the number of edges in an unweighted graph. In this paper, we evaluate the benefits and limitations associated with using cost-integrated topological metrics. Our focus is on comparing populations of weighted undirected graphs using global efficiency. We evaluate different approaches to the comparison of weighted networks that differ in mean association weight. Our key result shows that integrating over cost is equivalent to controlling for any monotonic transformation of the weight set of a weighted graph. That is, when integrating over cost, we eliminate the differences in topology that may be due to a monotonic transformation of the weight set. Our result holds for any unweighted topological measure. Cost-integration is therefore helpful in disentangling differences in cost from differences in topology. By contrast, we show that the use of the weighted version of a topological metric does not constitute a valid approach to this problem. Indeed, we prove that, under mild conditions, the use of the weighted version of global efficiency is equivalent to simply comparing weighted costs. Thus, we recommend the reporting of (i) differences in weighted costs and (ii) differences in cost-integrated topological measures. We demonstrate the application of these techniques in a re-analysis of an fMRI working memory task. Finally, we discuss the limitations of integrating topology over cost, which may pose problems when some weights are zero, when multiplicities exist in the ranks of the weights, and when one expects subtle cost-dependent topological differences, which could be masked by cost-integration.",11,['stat'],10

Prior biochemical and crystallography studies from several labs did not include this critical element due to over-truncation of the RNA.

1105.0448,q-bio,"Fitness effects of mutations fall on a continuum ranging from lethal to deleterious to beneficial. The distribution of fitness effects (DFE) among random mutations is an essential component of every evolutionary model and a mathematical portrait of robustness. Recent experiments on five viral species all revealed a characteristic bimodal shaped DFE, featuring peaks at neutrality and lethality. However, the phenotypic causes underlying observed fitness effects are still unknown, and presumably thought to vary unpredictably from one mutation to another. By combining population genetics simulations with a simple biophysical protein folding model, we show that protein thermodynamic stability accounts for a large fraction of observed mutational effects. We assume that moderately destabilizing mutations inflict a fitness penalty proportional to the reduction in folded protein, which depends continuously on folding free energy (letter G). Most mutations in our model affect fitness by altering letter G, while, based on simple estimates, \approx10% abolish activity and are unconditionally lethal. Mutations pushing letter G>0 are also considered lethal. Contrary to neutral network theory, we find that, in mutation/selection/drift steady-state, high mutation rates (m) lead to less stable proteins and a more dispersed DFE, i.e. less mutational robustness. Small population size (N) also decreases stability and robustness. In our model, a continuum of non-lethal mutations reduces fitness by \approx2% on average, while \approx10-35% of mutations are lethal, depending on N and m. Compensatory mutations are common in small populations with high mutation rates. More broadly, we conclude that interplay between biophysical and population genetic forces shapes the DFE.",11,[],10

This requires approaches different to those used in existing work on this subject. In addition, a rather explicit characterization is obtained of regions of parameter space for which the system has a given number of stationary solutions.",11,['math'],10

These two-species models can be simplified to a one-species model with a time dependent extrinsic growth factor. With a one-species model with an effective carrying capacity one is able to retrieve the steady state solutions of the previous one-species model. The equivalence obtained between the effective carrying capacity and the extrinsic growth factor is complete only for a particular case, the Gompertz model.

1112.2072,q-bio,"Modified-Electroconvulsive Therapy (m-ECT) is administered for the treatment of various psychiatric disorders. The Seizure Generalization Hypothesis holds that propagation of the induced seizure throughout the whole brain is essential for the effective ECT intervention. However, we encounter many clinical cases where, due to high thresholds, seizure is not induced by the maximum dose of electrical charge. Some studies have indicated that the ultrabrief pulse method, in which pulse width is less than 0.5millisecond (ms), is more effective at inducing seizure than conventional brief pulse (0.5ms-2.0ms). Contrary to the studies, we experienced a case of schizophrenia in which m-ECT with 1.0 and 1.5 ms width pulse (referred to as 'long' brief pulse as 0.5ms width pulse is the default in Japan) succeeded in inducing seizure, whereas ultrabrief pulse failed to induce seizure. This case is described in detail. Moreover, we discuss the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon.",11,['physics'],10
1103.0342,q-bio,"In a community-structured population, public goods games (PGG) occur both within and between communities. Such type of PGG is referred as multilevel public goods games (MPGG). We propose a minimalist evolutionary model of the MPGG and analytically study the evolution of cooperation. We demonstrate that in the case of sufficiently large community size and community number, if the imitation strength within community is weak, i.e., an individual imitates another one in the same community almost randomly, cooperation as well as punishment are more abundant than defection in the long run; if the imitation strength between communities is strong, i.e., the more successful strategy in two individuals from distinct communities is always imitated, cooperation and punishment are also more abundant. However, when both of the two imitation intensities are strong, defection becomes the most abundant strategy in the population. Our model provides insight into the investigation of the large-scale cooperation in public social dilemma among contemporary communities.",11,[],10
1104.0021,q-bio,"Connectivity patterns of ecological elements are often the core concern of ecologists working at multiple levels of organization (e.g., populations, ecosystems, and landscapes) because these patterns often reflect the forces shaping the system's development as well as constraining their operation. One reason these patterns of direct connections are critical is that they establish the pathways through which elements influence each other indirectly. Here, we tested a hypothesized consequence of connectivity in ecosystems: the homogenization of resource distributions in flow networks. Specifically, we tested the generality of the systems ecology hypothesis of resource homogenization in 50 empirically derived trophic ecosystem models representing 35 distinct ecosystems. We applied Ecological Network Analysis to calculate resource homogenization for these models. We further evaluated the robustness of our results in two ways. First, we verified the close correspondence between the input- and output-oriented homogenization values to ensure that our results were not biased by our decision to focus on the output orientation. Second, we conducted a Monte Carlo based uncertainty analysis to determine the robustness of our results to /-5% error introduced into the original flow matrices for each model. Our results show that resource homogenization occurs universally in the 50 ecosystem models tested. We confirm that our results are not biased by using the output-oriented homogenization values because there is a significant linear regression between the input and output oriented homogenization (r2 = 0.38, p < 0.001). Finally, we found that our results are robust to /-5% error in the flow matrices. In conclusion, we found strong support for the resource homogenization hypothesis in 50 empirically derived ecosystem models.",11,[],10

We identified some pos- sible geomorphological controls that influence nest-site selection and survival using data collected along the Florida Gulf coast. In particular we focused on the effects of beach replenishment interventions on the Snowy Plover (SP), and on the migratory Piping Plover (PP) (Charadrius melodus) and Red Knot (RK) (Calidris canutus). To quantify the relationship between past renourishment projects and shorebird species we used a Monte Carlo procedure to sample from the posterior distribution of the binomial probabilities that a region is not a nesting or a wintering ground conditional on the occurrence of a beach replenishment intervention in the same and the previous year. The results indicate that it was 2.3, 3.1, and 0.8 times more likely that a region was not a wintering ground following a year with a renourishment intervention for the SP, PP and RK respectively. For the SP it was 2.5. times more likely that a region was not a breeding ground after a renourishment event. Through a maximum entropy principle model we observed small differences in the habitat use of the SP during the breeding and the wintering season. However the habitats where RK was observed ap- peared quite different. Maintaining and creating optimal suitable habitats for SP characterized by sparse low vegetation in the foredunes areas, and uneven/low-slope beach surfaces, is the proposed conservation scenario to convert anthropic beach restorations and SP populations into a positive feedback without impacting other threatened shorebird species.",11,[],10
1104.2845,q-bio,"Bistability plays a central role in the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) controlling many essential biological functions, including cellular differentiation and cell cycle control. However, establishing the network topologies that can exhibit bistability remains a challenge, in part due to the exceedingly large variety of GRNs that exist for even a small number of components. We begin to address this problem by employing chemical reaction network theory in a comprehensive in silico survey to determine the capacity for bistability of more than 40,000 simple networks that can be formed by two transcription factor-coding genes and their associated proteins (assuming only the most elementary biochemical processes). We find that there exist reaction rate constants leading to bistability in ~90% of these GRN models, including several circuits that do not contain any of the TF cooperativity commonly associated with bistable systems, and the majority of which could only be identified as bistable through an original subnetwork-based analysis. A topological sorting of the two-gene family of networks based on the presence or absence of biochemical reactions reveals eleven minimal bistable networks (i.e., bistable networks that do not contain within them a smaller bistable subnetwork). The large number of previously unknown bistable network topologies suggests that the capacity for switch-like behavior in GRNs arises with relative ease and is not easily lost through network evolution. To highlight the relevance of the systematic application of CRNT to bistable network identification in real biological systems, we integrated publicly available protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction, and gene expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and identified several GRNs predicted to behave in a bistable fashion.",11,[],10

It is shown that the landscape playing a central theoretical ""device"" that integrates several lines of inquiries: the stable behavior of the replicator dynamics, the long-time fixation, and continuous diffusion approximation associated with asymptotically large population. Several issues relating to the transient dynamics are discussed: (i) multiple time scales phenomenon associated with intra- and inter-attractoral dynamics; (ii) discontinuous transition in stochastically stationary process akin to Maxwell construction in equilibrium statistical physics; and (iii) the dilemma diffusion approximation facing as a continuous approximation of the discrete evolutionary dynamics. It is found that rare events with exponentially small probabilities, corresponding to the uphill movements and barrier crossing in the landscape with multiple wells that are made possible by strong nonlinear dynamics, plays an important role in understanding the origin of the complexity in evolutionary, nonlinear biological systems.",11,[],10

1104.3805,q-bio,"A prey animal surveying its environment must decide whether there is a dangerous predator present or not. If there is, it may flee. Flight has an associated cost, so the animal should not flee if there is no danger. However, the prey animal cannot know the state of its environment with certainty, and is thus bound to make some errors. We formulate a probabilistic automaton model of a prey animal's life and use it to compute the optimal escape decision strategy, subject to the animal's uncertainty. The uncertainty is a major factor in determining the decision strategy: only in the presence of uncertainty do economic factors (like mating opportunities lost due to flight) influence the decision. We performed computer simulations and found that \emphin silico populations of animals subject to predation evolve to display the strategies predicted by our model, confirming our choice of objective function for our analytic calculations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study of escape decisions to incorporate the effects of uncertainty, and to demonstrate the correctness of the objective function used in the model.",11,[],10
1101.3065,q-bio,"RNA viruses exist as genetically diverse populations displaying different phenotypes, including diverse degrees of virulence. The evolution of virulence in viral populations is, however, poorly understood. Based on the experimental observation of an RNA virus clone in cell culture diversifying into two subpopulations of different virulence, we study the dynamics of heterogeneous virus populations and the evolution of virulence. We introduce a competition-colonization trade-off into standard mathematical models of intra-host viral infection. Colonizers are fast spreading, virulent strains, whereas competitors are less virulent variants that are more successful within coinfected cells. We observe biphasic dynamics of the population: Early in the infection the population is dominated by colonizers, which later will be outcompeted by competitors. The simulations suggest the existence of a steady state where few low-virulence variants coexist. This equilibrium implies collective virulence attenuation in the population, in contrast to previous models predicting development of the population towards increased virulence. Nevertheless, the attenuation effect disappears if we include a highly simplified immune response in our models. Thus, the competition-colonization trade-off indicates a role for virulence in the modulation of the viral population diversity. The evolution of virulence is a dynamic feature of the population shaped by interactions between individuals and by the structure of the patchy habitat.",11,[],10
1112.3357,q-bio,"An individually costly act that benefits all group members is a public good. Natural selection favors individual contribution to public goods only when some benefit to the individual offsets the cost of contribution. Problems of sex ratio, parasite virulence, microbial metabolism, punishment of noncooperators, and nearly all aspects of sociality have been analyzed as public goods shaped by kin and group selection. Here, I develop two general aspects of the public goods problem that have received relatively little attention. First, variation in individual resources favors selfish individuals to vary their allocation to public goods. Those individuals better endowed contribute their excess resources to public benefit, whereas those individuals with fewer resources contribute less to the public good. Thus, purely selfish behavior causes individuals to stratify into upper classes that contribute greatly to public benefit and social cohesion and to lower classes that contribute little to the public good. Second, if group success absolutely requires production of the public good, then the pressure favoring production is relatively high. By contrast, if group success depends weakly on the public good, then the pressure favoring production is relatively weak. Stated in this way, it is obvious that the role of baseline success is important. However, discussions of public goods problems sometimes fail to emphasize this point sufficiently. The models here suggest simple tests for the roles of resource variation and baseline success. Given the widespread importance of public goods, better models and tests would greatly deepen our understanding of many processes in biology and sociality.",11,[],10
1111.6489,q-bio,"Objectives: Stress hormones have been associated with temporal discounting. Although time-discount rate is shown to be stable over a long term, no study to date examines whether individual differences in stress hormones could predict individuals' time-discount rates in the relatively distant future (e.g., six month later), which is of interest in neuroeconomics of stress-addiction association.   Methods: We assessed 87 participants' salivary stress hormone (cortisol, cortisone, and alpha-amylase) levels and hyperbolic discounting of delayed rewards consisting of three magnitudes, at the time-interval of six months. For salivary steroid assays, we employed a liquid chromatography/ mass spectroscopy (LC/MS) method. The correlations between the stress hormone levels and time-discount rates were examined.   Results: We observed that salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) levels were negatively associated with time-discount rates in never-smokers. Notably, salivary levels of stress steroids (i.e., cortisol and cortisone) negatively and positively related to time-discount rates in men and women, respectively, in never-smokers. Ever-smokers' discount rates were not predicted from these stress hormone levels.   Conclusions: Individual differences in stress hormone levels predict impulsivity in temporal discounting in the future. There are sex differences in the effect of stress steroids on temporal discounting; while there was no sex defference in the relationship between sAA and temporal discounting.",11,[],10

Recruitment is characterized by nodes changing their status to that of the recruiting class as a result of contact with recruiting nodes. Only a susceptible subset of nodes can be recruited. The recruiting individuals may adapt their connections in order to improve recruitment capabilities, thus changing the network structure adaptively. We derive a mean field theory to predict the dependence of the growth threshold of the recruiting class on the adaptation parameter. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of adaptation on the recruitment level, as well as on network topology. The theoretical predictions are compared with direct simulations of the full system.

In the first class, there is limited overlap between the modules, which implies higher rigidity of the individual units; there the conformational changes can be described by an energy transfer mechanism. In the second class, the topology presents a compact structure with significant overlap between the modules; there the conformational changes can be described by multi-trajectories; that is, multiple highly populated pathways. We further propose that disordered protein regions evolved to help other protein segments reach rarely visited but functionally-related states. We also show the role of disorder in spatial games of amino acids; highlight the effects of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) on cellular networks and list some possible studies linking protein disorder and protein structure networks.",11,"['cond-mat', 'physics']",10

Local topological features such as degree, clustering coefficient, gradient as well as topology potential are adopted to analyze the advantages of ANs in cooperation enhancement. Furthermore, a degree-skeleton underlying ANs is uncovered for understanding the cooperation diffusion.

This review focuses on quantitative aspects of L-type currents. L-type channels are now distinguished according to their structure as one of four main subtypes 1.1-1.4. L-type calcium currents play many fundamental roles in cellular dynamical processes including pacemaking in neurons and cardiac cells, the activation of transcription factors involved in synaptic plasticity and in immune cells. The half-activation potentials of L-type currents have been ascribed values as low as -50 mV and as high as near 0 mV. The inactivation of IL has been found to be both voltage (VDI) and calcium-dependent (CDI) and the latter component may involve calcium-induced calcium release. CDI is often an important aspect of dynamical models of cell electrophysiology. We describe the basic components in modeling IL including activation and both voltage and calcium dependent inactivation and the two main approaches to determining the current. We review, by means of tables of values from over 65 representative studies, the various details of the dynamical properties associated with IL that have been found experimentally or employed in the last 25 years in deterministic modeling in various nervous system and cardiac cells.

1105.5033,q-bio,"Can we objectively distinguish chemical systems that are able to process meaningful information from those that are not suitable for information processing? Here, we present a formal method to assess the semantic capacity of a chemical reaction network. The semantic capacity of a network can be measured by analyzing the capability of the network to implement molecular codes. We analyzed models of real chemical systems (Martian atmosphere chemistry and various combustion chemistries), bio-chemical systems (gene expression, gene translation, and phosphorylation signaling cascades), as well as an artificial chemistry and random networks. Our study suggests that different chemical systems posses different semantic capacities. Basically no semantic capacity was found in the atmosphere chemistry of Mars and all studied combustion chemistries, as well as in highly connected random networks, i.e., with these chemistries molecular codes cannot be implemented. High semantic capacity was found in the bio-chemical systems, as well as in random networks where the number of second order reactions is at the number of species. Hypotheses concern the origin and evolution of life.

However, most of them are specific to either a quantification strategy (e.g. label-free or isotopic labelling) or a mass-spectrometry system (e.g. high or low resolution).

Muller's ratchet provides a quantitative framework to study the effect of accumulation. Adaptive landscape as a powerful concept in system biology provides a handle to describe complex and rare biological events. In this article we study the evolutionary process of a population exposed to Muller's ratchet from the new viewpoint of adaptive landscape which allows us estimate the single click of the ratchet starting with an intuitive understanding.   Methods: We describe how Wright-Fisher process maps to Muller's ratchet. We analytically construct adaptive landscape from general diffusion equation. It shows that the construction is dynamical and the adaptive landscape is independent of the existence and normalization of the stationary distribution. We generalize the application of diffusion model from adaptive landscape viewpoint.   Results: We develop a novel method to describe the dynamical behavior of the population exposed to Muller's ratchet, and analytically derive the decaying time of the fittest class of populations as a mean first passage time. Most importantly, we describe the absorption phenomenon by adaptive landscape, where the stationary distribution is non-normalizable.

Jamming of motors is essential for cargos to execute long-range movement in this way. Results from computer simulations performed using the extended model indicate that cargo may execute bidirectional movement in the presence of motors of a single polarity, confirming previous analytical results. Moreover, these results suggest the existence of a balance between cargo hopping and the movement of the complex that may control the efficiency of cargo transfer and cargo delivering.

This work is made harder by the fact that new species and interactions are continuously discovered in experimental work, necessitating the development of adaptive and fast algorithms for network construction and updating.

Despite the wide availability of CE-based instruments, there remain challenges in leveraging their full power for quantitative analysis of RNA and DNA structure, thermodynamics, and kinetics. In particular, the slow rate and poor automation of available analysis tools have bottlenecked a new generation of studies involving hundreds of CE profiles per experiment.   Results: We propose a computational method called high-throughput robust analysis for capillary electrophoresis (HiTRACE) to automate the key tasks in large-scale nucleic acid CE analysis, including the profile alignment that has heretofore been a rate-limiting step in the highest throughput experiments. We illustrate the application of HiTRACE on thirteen data sets representing 4 different RNAs, three chemical modification strategies, and up to 480 single mutant variants; the largest data sets each include 87,360 bands. By applying a series of robust dynamic programming algorithms, HiTRACE outperforms prior tools in terms of alignment and fitting quality, as assessed by measures including the correlation between quantified band intensities between replicate data sets. Furthermore, while the smallest of these data sets required 7 to 10 hours of manual intervention using prior approaches, HiTRACE quantitation of even the largest data sets herein was achieved in 3 to 12 minutes.

1105.4688,q-bio,"Proteins with multiple binding sites play important roles in cell signaling systems by nucleating protein complexes in which, for example, enzymes and substrates are co-localized. Proteins that specialize in this function are called by a variety names, including adapter, linker and scaffold. Scaffold-mediated nucleation of protein complexes can be either constitutive or induced. Induced nucleation is commonly mediated by a docking site on a scaffold that is activated by phosphorylation. Here, by considering minimalist mathematical models, which recapitulate scaffold effects seen in more mechanistically detailed models, we obtain analytical and numerical results that provide insights into scaffold function. These results elucidate how recruitment of a pair of ligands to a scaffold depends on the concentrations of the ligands, on the binding constants for ligand-scaffold interactions, on binding cooperativity, and on the milieu of the scaffold, as ligand recruitment is affected by competitive ligands and decoy receptors. For the case of a bivalent scaffold, we obtain an expression for the unique scaffold concentration that maximally recruits a pair of monovalent ligands. Through simulations, we demonstrate that a bivalent scaffold can nucleate distinct sets of ligands to equivalent extents when the scaffold is present at different concentrations. Thus, the function of a scaffold can potentially change qualitatively with a change in copy number. We also demonstrate how a scaffold can change the catalytic efficiency of an enzyme and the sensitivity of the rate of reaction to substrate concentration. The results presented here should be useful for understanding scaffold function and for engineering scaffolds to have desired properties.",11,[],10

1112.0639,q-bio,"Short-term presynaptic plasticity designates variations of the amplitude of synaptic information transfer whereby the amount of neurotransmitter released upon presynaptic stimulation changes over seconds as a function of the neuronal firing activity. While a consensus has emerged that changes of the synapse strength are crucial to neuronal computations, their modes of expression in vivo remain unclear. Recent experimental studies have reported that glial cells, particularly astrocytes in the hippocampus, are able to modulate short-term plasticity but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the characteristics of short-term plasticity modulation by astrocytes using a biophysically realistic computational model. Mean-field analysis of the model unravels that astrocytes may mediate counterintuitive effects. Depending on the expressed presynaptic signaling pathways, astrocytes may globally inhibit or potentiate the synapse: the amount of released neurotransmitter in the presence of the astrocyte is transiently smaller or larger than in its absence. But this global effect usually coexists with the opposite local effect on paired pulses: with release-decreasing astrocytes most paired pulses become facilitated, while paired-pulse depression becomes prominent under release-increasing astrocytes. Moreover, we show that the frequency of astrocytic intracellular Ca2 oscillations controls the effects of the astrocyte on short-term synaptic plasticity. Our model explains several experimental observations yet unsolved, and uncovers astrocytic gliotransmission as a possible transient switch between short-term paired-pulse depression and facilitation. This possibility has deep implications on the processing of neuronal spikes and resulting information transfer at synapses.",11,[],10

We characterize the proposed methods in the context of the other compared methods and show that, coupled with motif subtype identification, the proposed methods can be effectively applied to a wide range of transcription factors.

1107.0997,q-bio,"The last decade saw the advent of increasingly realistic epidemic models that leverage on the availability of highly detailed census and human mobility data. Data-driven models aim at a granularity down to the level of households or single individuals. However, relatively little systematic work has been done to provide coupled behavior-disease models able to close the feedback loop between behavioral changes triggered in the population by an individual's perception of the disease spread and the actual disease spread itself. While models lacking this coupling can be extremely successful in mild epidemics, they obviously will be of limited use in situations where social disruption or behavioral alterations are induced in the population by knowledge of the disease. Here we propose a characterization of a set of prototypical mechanisms for self-initiated social distancing induced by local and non-local prevalence-based information available to individuals in the population. We characterize the effects of these mechanisms in the framework of a compartmental scheme that enlarges the basic SIR model by considering separate behavioral classes within the population. The transition of individuals in/out of behavioral classes is coupled with the spreading of the disease and provides a rich phase space with multiple epidemic peaks and tipping points. The class of models presented here can be used in the case of data-driven computational approaches to analyze scenarios of social adaptation and behavioral change.",11,"['cond-mat', 'physics']",10

As a result, true single-cell behavior, particularly that which is cell-cycle--dependent, is often obscured in population-level (averaged) measurements. We have developed a simple deconvolution method that can be used to remove the effects of asynchronous variability from population-level time-series data. In this paper, we summarize some recent progress in the development and application of our approach, and provide technical updates that result in increased biological fidelity.

1106.0269,q-bio,"In the last decade diffusion MRI has become a powerful tool to non-invasively study white-matter integrity in the brain. Recently many research groups have focused their attention on multi-shell spherical acquisitions with the aim of effectively mapping the diffusion signal with a lower number of q-space samples, hence enabling a crucial reduction of acquisition time. One of the quantities commonly studied in this context is the so-called orientation distribution function (ODF). In this setting, the spherical harmonic (SH) transform has gained a great deal of popularity thanks to its ability to perform convolution operations efficiently and accurately, such as the Funk-Radon transform notably required for ODF computation from q-space data. However, if the q-space signal is described with an unsuitable angular resolution at any b-value probed, aliasing (or interpolation) artifacts are unavoidably created. So far this aspect has been tackled empirically and, to our knowledge, no study has addressed this problem in a quantitative approach. The aim of the present work is to study more theoretically the efficiency of multi-shell spherical sampling in diffusion MRI, in order to gain understanding in HYDI-like approaches, possibly paving the way to further optimization strategies.",11,['physics'],10
1106.1620,q-bio,"The phenomena of stochasticity in biochemical processes have been intriguing life scientists for the past few decades. We now know that living cells take advantage of stochasticity in some cases and counteract stochastic effects in others. The source of intrinsic stochasticity in biomolecular systems are random timings of individual reactions, which cumulatively drive the variability in outputs of such systems. Despite the acknowledged relevance of stochasticity in the functioning of living cells no rigorous method have been proposed to precisely identify sources of variability. In this paper we propose a novel methodology that allows us to calculate contributions of individual reactions into the variability of a system's output. We demonstrate that some reactions have dramatically different effects on noise than others. Surprisingly, in the class of open conversion systems that serve as an approximate model of signal transduction, the degradation of an output contributes half of the total noise. We also demonstrate the importance of degradation in other relevant systems and propose a degradation feedback control mechanism that has the capability of an effective noise suppression. Application of our method to some well studied biochemical systems such as: gene expression, Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics, and the p53 system indicates that our methodology reveals an unprecedented insight into the origins of variability in biochemical systems. For many systems an analytical decomposition is not available; therefore the method has been implemented as a Matlab package and is available from the authors upon request.",11,[],10
1104.4092,q-bio,"Two distinct mechanisms for filtering noise in an input signal are identified in a class of adaptive sensory networks. We find that the high frequency noise is filtered by the output degradation process through time-averaging; while the low frequency noise is damped by adaptation through negative feedback. Both filtering processes themselves introduce intrinsic noises, which are found to be unfiltered and can thus amount to a significant internal noise floor even without signaling. These results are applied to E. coli chemotaxis. We show unambiguously that the molecular mechanism for the Berg-Purcell time-averaging scheme is the dephosphorylation of the response regulator CheY-P, not the receptor adaptation process as previously suggested. The high frequency noise due to the stochastic ligand binding-unbinding events and the random ligand molecule diffusion is averaged by the CheY-P dephosphorylation process to a negligible level in E.coli. We identify a previously unstudied noise source caused by the random motion of the cell in a ligand gradient. We show that this random walk induced signal noise has a divergent low frequency component, which is only rendered finite by the receptor adaptation process. For gradients within the E. coli sensing range, this dominant external noise can be comparable to the significant intrinsic noise in the system. The dependence of the response and its fluctuations on the key time scales of the system are studied systematically. We show that the chemotaxis pathway may have evolved to optimize gradient sensing, strong response, and noise control in different time scales",11,['physics'],10
1110.1413,q-bio,"The structure of hierarchical networks in biological and physical systems has long been characterized using the Horton-Strahler ordering scheme. The scheme assigns an integer order to each edge in the network based on the topology of branching such that the order increases from distal parts of the network (e.g., mountain streams or capillaries) to the ""root"" of the network (e.g., the river outlet or the aorta). However, Horton-Strahler ordering cannot be applied to networks with loops because they they create a contradiction in the edge ordering in terms of which edge precedes another in the hierarchy. Here, we present a generalization of the Horton-Strahler order to weighted planar reticular networks, where weights are assumed to correlate with the importance of network edges, e.g., weights estimated from edge widths may correlate to flow capacity. Our method assigns hierarchical levels not only to edges of the network, but also to its loops, and classifies the edges into reticular edges, which are responsible for loop formation, and tree edges. In addition, we perform a detailed and rigorous theoretical analysis of the sensitivity of the hierarchical levels to weight perturbations. We discuss applications of this generalized Horton-Strahler ordering to the study of leaf venation and other biological networks.",11,['cond-mat'],10

1106.0506,q-bio,"In this paper, a co-infection of malaria and visceral helminthiasis with immune stimulation and impairment is studied. We have assumed that an individual gets malaria infection during invasion by helminths larvae. In absence of immune response, our results show that the antigens invade the blood system if the rate of red cell rupture per invading merozoite is greater than one. If fewer merozoites are released, the initial state is globally asymptotically stable. If more merozoites are released, there exists malaria-only endemic point. However, both antigens coexist if the mean infection burden is greater than one. In this case, there is a threshold value for drug action below which no recovery of host is expected. In presence of immune response, three equilibrium states exist. The initial invasion state, and secondly, the unstable state when the immune population has been triggered and the antigens have been eliminated. The third state represents the endemic state which is stable if the infection-induced rupture rate per erythrocyte with immune activation is less than the total mortality of the erythrocytes. A model for severity of the co-infection shows that an immune response will be delayed until immunological barrier values for malaria and helminths are exceeded.",11,['math'],10

1110.4944,q-bio,"Phylogenetic comparative methods may fail to produce meaningful results when either the underlying model is inappropriate or the data contain insufficient information to inform the inference. The ability to measure the statistical power of these methods has become crucial to ensure that data quantity keeps pace with growing model complexity. Through simulations, we show that commonly applied model choice methods based on information criteria can have remarkably high error rates; this can be a problem because methods to estimate the uncertainty or power are not widely known or applied. Furthermore, the power of comparative methods can depend significantly on the structure of the data. We describe a Monte Carlo based method which addresses both of these challenges, and show how this approach both quantifies and substantially reduces errors relative to information criteria. The method also produces meaningful confidence intervals for model parameters. We illustrate how the power to distinguish different models, such as varying levels of selection, varies both with number of taxa and structure of the phylogeny. We provide an open-source implementation in the pmc (""Phylogenetic Monte Carlo"") package for the R programming language.

1112.3322,q-bio,"A quasispecies is a set of interrelated genotypes that have reached a situation of equilibrium while evolving according to the usual Darwinian principles of selection and mutation. Quasispecies studies invariably assume that it is possible for any genotype to mutate into any other, but recent finds indicate that this assumption is not necessarily true. Here we revisit the traditional quasispecies theory by adopting a network structure to constrain the occurrence of mutations. Such structure is governed by a random-graph model, whose single parameter (a probability p) controls both the graph's density and the dynamics of mutation. We contribute two further modifications to the theory, one to account for the fact that different loci in a genotype may be differently susceptible to the occurrence of mutations, the other to allow for a more plausible description of the transition from adaptation to degeneracy of the quasispecies as p is increased. We give analytical and simulation results for the usual case of binary genotypes, assuming the fitness landscape in which a genotype's fitness decays exponentially with its Hamming distance to the wild type. These results support the theory's assertions regarding the adaptation of the quasispecies to the fitness landscape and also its possible demise as a function of p.",11,['cond-mat'],10
1109.4160,q-bio,"Cooperative interactions among sensory receptors provide a general mechanism to increase the sensitivity of signal transduction. In particular, bacterial chemotaxis receptors interact cooperatively to produce an ultrasensitive response to chemoeffector concentrations. However, cooperativity between receptors in large macromolecular complexes is necessarily based on local interactions and consequently is fundamentally connected to slowing of receptor conformational dynamics, which increases intrinsic noise. Therefore, it is not clear whether or under what conditions cooperativity actually increases the precision of the concentration measurement. We explictly calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for sensing a concentration change using a simple, Ising-type model of receptor-receptor interactions, generalized via scaling arguments, and find that the optimal SNR is always achieved by independent receptors.",11,[],10

The swinging changes in the fluctuation in the transient state from the initial growth to the final steady state are the consequence of a topology-dependent time trial competition between the profitable interactions and expense.

1106.4783,q-bio,"A framework for the mathematical modeling of evolution in group structured populations is introduced. The population is divided into a fixed large number of groups of fixed size. From generation to generation, new groups are formed that descend from previous groups, through a two-level Fisher-Wright process, with selection between groups and within groups and with migration between groups at rate equation. When equation, the framework reduces to the often used trait-group framework, so that our setting can be seen as an extension of that approach. Our framework allows the analysis of previously introduced models in which altruists and non-altruists compete, and provides new insights into these models. We focus on the situation in which initially there is a single altruistic allele in the population, and no further mutations occur. The main questions are conditions for the viability of that altruistic allele to spread, and the fashion in which it spreads when it does. Because our results and methods are rigorous, we see them as shedding light on various controversial issues in this field, including the role of Hamilton's rule, and of the Price equation, the relevance of linearity in fitness functions and the need to only consider pairwise interactions, or weak selection. In this paper we analyze the early stages of the evolution, during which the number of altruists is small compared to the size of the population. We show that during this stage the evolution is well described by a multitype branching process. The driving matrix for this process can be obtained, reducing the problem of determining when the altruistic gene is viable to a comparison between the leading eigenvalue of that matrix, and the fitness of the non-altruists before the altruistic gene appeared. This leads to a generalization of Hamilton's condition for the viability of a mutant gene.",11,[],10
1107.5095,q-bio,"Principal components (PCA) and hierarchical clustering are two of the most heavily used techniques for analyzing the differences between nucleic acid sequence samples sampled from a given environment. However, a classical application of these techniques to distances computed between samples can lack transparency because there is no ready interpretation of the axes of classical PCA plots, and it is difficult to assign any clear intuitive meaning to either the internal nodes or the edge lengths of trees produced by distance-based hierarchical clustering methods such as UPGMA. We show that more interesting and interpretable results are produced by two new methods that leverage the special structure of phylogenetic placement data. Edge principal components analysis enables the detection of important differences between samples that contain closely related taxa. Each principal component axis is simply a collection of signed weights on the edges of the phylogenetic tree, and these weights are easily visualized by a suitable thickening and coloring of the edges. Squash clustering outputs a (rooted) clustering tree in which each internal node corresponds to an appropriate ""average"" of the original samples at the leaves below the node. Moreover, the length of an edge is a suitably defined distance between the averaged samples associated with the two incident nodes, rather than the less interpretable average of distances produced by UPGMA. We present these methods and illustrate their use with data from the microbiome of the human vagina.",11,[],10
1106.4388,q-bio,"McNamara and Dall (2011) identified novel relationships between the abundance of a species in different environments, the temporal properties of environmental change, and selection for or against dispersal. Here, the mathematics underlying these relationships in their two-environment model are investigated for arbitrary numbers of environments. The effect they described is quantified as the fitness-abundance covariance. The phase in the life cycle where the population is censused is crucial for the implications of the fitness-abundance covariance. These relationships are shown to connect to the population genetics literature on the Reduction Principle for the evolution of genetic systems and migration. Conditions that produce selection for increased unconditional dispersal are found to be new instances of departures from reduction described by the ""Principle of Partial Control"" proposed for the evolution of modifier genes. According to this principle, variation that only partially controls the processes that transform the transmitted information of organisms may be selected to increase these processes. Mathematical methods of Karlin, Friedland, and Elsner, Johnson, and Neumann, are central in generalizing the analysis. Analysis of the adaptive landscape of the model shows that the evolution of conditional dispersal is very sensitive to the spectrum of genetic variation the population is capable of producing, and suggests that empirical study of particular species will require an evaluation of its variational properties.",11,['math'],10
1112.5685,q-bio,"To maintain bone mass during bone remodelling, coupling is required between bone resorption and bone formation. This coordination is achieved by a network of autocrine and paracrine signalling molecules between cells of the osteoclast lineage and cells of the osteoblastic lineage. Mathematical modelling of signalling between cells of both lineages can assist in the interpretation of experimental data, clarify signalling interactions and help develop a deeper understanding of complex bone diseases. In this paper, we further develop a mathematical model of bone cell interactions by Pivonka et al. (2008) to include the proliferation of precursor osteoblasts into the model. This inclusion is important to be able to account for Wnt signalling, believed to play an important role in anabolic responses of bone. We show that an increased rate of differentiation to precursor cells or an increased rate of proliferation of precursor osteoblasts themselves both result in increased bone mass. However, modelling these different processes separately enables the new model to represent recent experimental discoveries such as the role of Wnt signalling in bone biology and the recruitment of osteoblast progenitor cells by transforming growth factor letter. Finally, we illustrate the power of the new model's capabilities by applying the model to prostate cancer metastasis to bone. In the bone microenvironment, prostate cancer cells are believed to release some of the same signalling molecules used to coordinate bone remodelling (i.e. Wnt and PTHrP), enabling the cancer cells to disrupt normal signalling and coordination between bone cells. This disruption can lead to either bone gain or bone loss.

This problem acquired a new dimension with the recent discovery that environmental and genetic perturbations of the bacterium Escherichia coli are followed by the temporary activation of a large number of latent metabolic pathways, which suggests the hypothesis that temporarily activated reactions impact growth and hence facilitate adaptation in the presence of perturbations. Here we test this hypothesis computationally and find, surprisingly, that the availability of latent pathways consistently offers no growth advantage, and tends in fact to inhibit growth after genetic perturbations. This is shown to be true even for latent pathways with a known function in alternate conditions, thus extending the significance of this adverse effect beyond apparently nonessential genes.

In particular, we use it to develop a general framework for the study of a family of quantum estimation problems wherein one is given n copies of an unknown quantum state according to some prior and the goal is to estimate certain parameters of the given state. In particular, we are interested to know whether collective measurements are useful and if so to find an upper bound on the amount of entanglement which is required to achieve the optimal estimation. In the case of pure states, we show that commutativity of the set of observables that define the estimation problem implies the sufficiency of unentangled measurements.",11,[],6

In particular, we analyze in detail the limitations of the protocol of Travaglione and Milburn (PRA 2002) that has been implemented by several experimental groups in recent years. Based on the first realization in our group (PRL 2009), we investigate the consequences of leaving the scope of the approximations originally made, such as the Lamb--Dicke approximation. We explain the consequential deviations from the idealized QW for different experimental realizations and an increasing number of steps by taking into account higher-order terms of the quantum evolution. It turns out that these become dominant after a few steps already, which is confirmed by experimental results and is currently limiting the scalability of this approach. Finally, we propose a new scheme using short laser pulses, derived from a protocol from the field of quantum computation. We show that the new scheme is not subject to the above-mentioned restrictions, and analytically and numerically evaluate its limitations, based on a realistic implementation with our specific setup. Implementing the protocol with state-of-the-art techniques should allow for substantially increasing the number of steps to 100 and beyond and should be extendable to higher-dimensional QWs.",11,[],6
1108.1412,quant-ph,"Proposals for quantum computing using rotational states of polar molecules as qubits have previously considered only diatomic molecules. For these the Stark effect is second-order, so a sizable external electric field is required to produce the requisite dipole moments in the laboratory frame. Here we consider use of polar symmetric top molecules. These offer advantages resulting from a first-order Stark effect, which renders the effective dipole moments nearly independent of the field strength. That permits use of much lower external field strengths for addressing sites. Moreover, for a particular choice of qubits, the electric dipole interactions become isomorphous with NMR systems for which many techniques enhancing logic gate operations have been developed. Also inviting is the wider chemical scope, since many symmetric top organic molecules provide options for auxiliary storage qubits in spin and hyperfine structure or in internal rotation states.",11,[],6

For fermionic states, the Unruh effect even for infinite accelerations cannot completely remove the entanglement. However, for the bosonic states, the situation is different and the entanglement vanishes asymptotically. Also, the entanglement is studied for the bipartite subsystems. While for the GHZ states all the bipartite subsystems are identically disentangled, for the W states the bipartite subsystems are somewhat entangled, though, this entanglement can be removed for appropriately accelerated observers. Interestingly, logarithmic negativity as a measure for determining the entanglement of one part of the system relative to the other two parts, is not generally the same for different parts. This means that we encounter tripartite systems where each part is differently entangled to the other two parts.",11,[],6

We find that for a common fluctuating driving field, a stochastic resonance effect appears as function of the ratio between field strength and noise strength. The effect disappears in the case of uncorrelated or separate pumps.

Secondly, applying the perturbative theory which works when the cavity wall begins to move at time origin, we find that the non-adiabatic force is quadratic in the wall velocity and thereby does not break the time-reversal symmetry, in contrast with the general belief. Finally, using an assembly of the transitionless quantum states, we obtain the nonadiabatic force exactly. The exact result justifies the validity of both the definition of force operator and the issue of the perturbative theory.

Quantities related to quantum information theoretic measures like entanglement, quantum discord (QD) and fidelity are known to provide signatures of QPTs. The issue is less well explored when the quantum system is subjected to decoherence due to its interaction, represented by a quantum channel, with an environment. In this paper we study the dynamics of the mutual information equation, the classical correlations equation and the quantum correlations equation, as measured by the QD, in a two-qubit state the density matrix of which is the reduced density matrix obtained from the ground state of the TIM in 1d. The time evolution brought about by system-environment interactions is assumed to be Markovian in nature and the quantum channels considered are amplitude damping, bit-flip, phase-flip and bit-phase-flip. Each quantum channel is shown to be distinguished by a specific type of dynamics. In the case of the phase-flip channel, there is a finite time interval in which the quantum correlations are larger in magnitude than the classical correlations.

1101.3764,quant-ph,"In recent work, Benjamin Schumacher and Michael~D. Westmoreland investigate a version of quantum mechanics which they call ""modal quantum theory"" but which we prefer to call ""discrete quantum theory"". This theory is obtained by instantiating the mathematical framework of Hilbert spaces with a finite field instead of the field of complex numbers. This instantiation collapses much the structure of actual quantum mechanics but retains several of its distinguishing characteristics including the notions of superposition, interference, and entanglement. Furthermore, discrete quantum theory excludes local hidden variable models, has a no-cloning theorem, and can express natural counterparts of quantum information protocols such as superdense coding and teleportation. Our first result is to distill a model of discrete quantum computing from this quantum theory. The model is expressed using a monadic metalanguage built on top of a universal reversible language for finite computations, and hence is directly implementable in a language like Haskell. In addition to superpositions and invertible linear maps, the model includes conventional programming constructs including pairs, sums, higher-order functions, and recursion. Our second result is to relate this programming model to relational programming, e.g., a pure version of Prolog over finite relations. Surprisingly discrete quantum computing is identical to conventional logic programming except for a small twist that is responsible for all the 'quantum-ness.' The twist occurs when merging sets of answers computed by several alternatives: the answers are combined using an ""exclusive"" version of logical disjunction.

1107.2138,quant-ph,"The quantum measurement problem, understanding why a unique outcome is obtained in each individual experiment, is tackled by solving models. After an introduction we review the many dynamical models proposed over the years. A flexible and rather realistic model is introduced, describing the measurement of the equation-component of a spin through interaction with a magnetic memory simulated by a Curie--Weiss magnet, including equation spins weakly coupled to a phonon bath. Initially prepared in a metastable paramagnetic state, it may transit to its up or down ferromagnetic state, triggered by its coupling with the tested spin, so that its magnetization acts as a pointer.   A detailed solution of the dynamical equations is worked out. Conditions are found, which ensure that the process satisfies the features of ideal measurements. Various imperfections are discussed, as well as attempts of incompatible measurements. The first steps consist in the solution of the Hamiltonian dynamics for the spin-apparatus density matrix equation. On a longer time scale, the trend towards equilibrium of the magnet produces a final state equation that involves correlations between the system and the indications of the pointer, thus ensuring registration. A difficulty lies in a quantum ambiguity: There exist many incompatible decompositions of the density matrix equation. This difficulty is overcome by dynamics due to suitable interactions within the apparatus.   Any subset of runs thus reaches over a brief delay a stable state which satisfies the same hierarchic property as in classical probability theory. Standard quantum statistical mechanics alone appears sufficient to explain the occurrence of a unique answer in each run.

The first tier of coarse-graining provides the averaged effect of the medium upon the field, quantified by a complex permittivity (in the frequency domain) describing the response of the dielectric to the field in addition to its back action on the field through a stochastic forcing term. The last tier of coarse- graining over the atom's internal degrees of freedom results in an equation of motion for the atom's center of mass from which we can derive the force on the atom.

In our scheme, Alice and Bob each play the role of a sender and a receiver as two states cos(letter1/2)0>  sin(letter1/2)exp(iletter1)1>, cos(letter2/2)0>  sin(letter2/2)exp(iletter2)1> are transferred through one channel simultaneously. We find that the transmission fidelity at each end of a spin chain can usually be enhanced by the presence of a second party. This is an important result for establishing the viability of duplex quantum communication through spin chain networks.",11,[],6
1105.2282,quant-ph,"We study the regularized average Renyi output entropy equation of quantum channels. This quantity gives information about the average noisiness of the channel output arising from a typical, highly entangled input state in the limit of infinite dimensions. We find a closed expression for equation, a quantity which we conjecture to be equal to equation. We find an explicit form for equation for some entanglement-breaking channels, and also for the qubit depolarizing channel equation as a function of the parameter equation. We prove equality of the two quantities in some cases, in particular we conclude that for equation both are non-analytic functions of the variable equation.",11,[],6
1105.2843,quant-ph,"We consider the computational complexity of Hamiltonians which are sums of commuting terms acting on plaquettes in a square lattice of qubits, and we show that deciding whether the ground state minimizes the energy of each local term individually is in the complexity class NP. That is, if the ground states has this property, this can be proven using a classical certificate which can be efficiently verified on a classical computer. Different to previous results on commuting Hamiltonians, our certificate proves the existence of such a state without giving instructions on how to prepare it.",11,[],6
1112.6356,quant-ph,"The position-momentum uncertainty-like inequality based on moments of arbitrary order for d-dimensional quantum systems, which is a generalization of the celebrated Heisenberg formulation of the uncertainty principle, is improved here by use of the Renyi-entropy-based uncertainty relation. The accuracy of the resulting lower bound is physico-computationally analyzed for the two main prototypes in d-dimensional physics: the hydrogenic and oscillator-like systems.",11,[],6
1104.4644,quant-ph,Cylindrically symmetric electron beams in spin polarization are reported for the first time. They are shown to be the eigen states of total angular momentum in the equation direction. But they are neither the eigen states of spin nor the eigen states of orbital angular momentum in that direction.,11,[],6
1103.5471,quant-ph,"The use of quantum correlations between photons to measure polarization mode dispersion (PMD) and chromatic dispersion is investigated. Two types of apparatus are discussed which use coincidence counting of entangled photon pairs to allow sub-femtosecond resolution for measurement of both PMD and chromatic dispersion, as well as separation of even-order and odd-order chromatic effects in the PMD. Group delays can be measured with a resolution of order 0.1 fs, whereas attosecond resolution can be achieved for phase delays.",11,['physics'],6

1110.3623,quant-ph,"We present and discuss a general density-matrix description of energy-dissipation and decoherence phenomena in open quantum systems, able to overcome the intrinsic limitations of the conventional Markov approximation. In particular, the proposed alternative adiabatic scheme does not threaten positivity at any time. The key idea of our approach rests in the temporal symmetrization and coarse graining of the scattering term in the Liouville-von Neumann equation, before applying the reduction procedure over the environment degrees of freedom. The resulting dynamics is genuinely Lindblad-like and recovers the Fermi's golden rule features in the semiclassical limit. Applications to the prototypical case of a semiconductor quantum dot exposed to incoherent phonon excitation peaked around a central mode are discussed, highlighting the success of our formalism with respect to the critical issues of the conventional Markov limit.",11,[],6
1108.4306,quant-ph,This paper gives a QMA (Quantum Merlin-Arthur) protocol for 3-SAT with two logarithmic-size quantum proofs (that are not entangled with each other) such that the gap between the completeness and the soundness is Omega(1/n polylog(n)). This improves the best completeness/soundness gaps known for NP-complete problems in this setting.,11,['cs'],6
1104.3671,quant-ph,"We combine, in a single set-up,the complex time parametrization in path integration, and the closed time formalism of non-equilibrium field theories to produce a compact representation of the time evolution of the reduced density matrix. In this framework we introduce a cluster-type expansion that facilitates perturbative and non-perturbative calculations in the realm of open quantum systems. The technical details of some very simple examples are discussed.",11,[],6
1106.4429,quant-ph,"Primitive photosynthetic cells appear over three billion years prior to any other more complex life-forms, thus it is reasonable to assume that Nature has designed a photosynthetic mechanism using minimal resources but honed to perfection under the action of evolution. A number of different quantum models have been proposed to understand the high degree of efficient energy transport, most of them are limited to the scenario of single-exciton. Here we present a study on the dynamics in light-harvesting complexes beyond the single exciton limit, and show how this model describes the energy transfer in the Fenna-Matthew-Olson (FMO) complex. We find that the energy transfer efficiency above 90% under realistic conditions is achievable.",11,[],6
1101.3908,quant-ph,"We examine the entanglement of cyclic spin 1/2 chains with anisotropic XY Z Heisenberg couplings of arbitrary range at transverse factorizing magnetic fields. At these fields the system exhibits a degenerate symmetry-breaking separable ground state (GS). It is shown, however, that the side limits of the GS pairwise entanglement at these fields are actually non-zero in finite chains, corresponding such fields to a GS spin-parity transition. These limits exhibit universal properties like being independent of the pair separation and interaction range, and are directly related to the magnetization jump. Illustrative exact results are shown for chains with I) full range and II) nearest neighbor couplings. Global entanglement properties at such points are also discussed.",11,['cond-mat'],6
1111.1511,quant-ph,"We present a flexible quantum-key-distribution-based protocol for quantum private queries. Similar to M. Jakobi et al's protocol [Phys. Rev. A 83, 022301 (2011)], it is loss tolerant, practical and robust against quantum memory attack. Furthermore, our protocol is more flexible and controllable. We show that, by adjusting the value of equation, the average number of the key bits Alice obtains can be located on any fixed value the users wanted for any database size. And the parameter equation is generally smaller (even equation can be achieved) when equation, which implies lower complexity of both quantum and classical communications. Furthermore, the users can choose a smaller equation to get better database security, or a larger equation to obtain a lower probability with which Bob can correctly guess the address of Alice's query.",11,[],6
1110.5759,quant-ph,"It has recently been shown that small quantum subsystems generically equilibrate, in the sense that they spend most of the time close to a fixed equilibrium state. This relies on just two assumptions: that the state is spread over many different energies, and that the Hamiltonian has non-degenerate energy gaps. Given the same assumptions, it has also been shown that closed systems equilibrate with respect to realistic measurements. We extend these results in two important ways. First, we prove equilibration over a finite (rather than infinite) time-interval, allowing us to bound the equilibration time. Second, we weaken the non degenerate energy gaps condition, showing that equilibration occurs provided that no energy gap is hugely degenerate.",11,['cond-mat'],6
1101.0448,quant-ph,"We obtain a lower bound on the sum of two orthogonal spin component variances in a plane. This gives a novel planar uncertainty relation which holds even when the Heisenberg relation is not useful. We investigate the asymptotic, large equation limit, and derive the properties of the planar quantum squeezed states that saturate this uncertainty relation. These states extend the concept of spin squeezing to any two conjugate spin directions. We show that planar quantum squeezing can be achieved experimentally as the ground state of a Bose-Einstein condensate in two coupled potential wells with a critical attractive interaction. These states reduce interferometric phase noise at all phase angles simultaneously. This is useful for one-shot interferometric phase-measurements where the measured phase is completely unknown. Our results can also be used to derive entanglement criteria for multiple spins equation at separated sites, with applications in quantum information.",11,[],6
1110.2433,quant-ph,"The particle approach to one-dimensional potential scattering is applied to non relativistic tunnelling between two, three and four identical barriers. We demonstrate as expected that the infinite sum of particle contributions yield the plane wave results. In particular, the existence of resonance/transparency for twin tunnelling in the wave limit is immediately obvious. The known resonances for three and four barriers are also derived. The transition from the wave limit to the particle limit is exhibit numerically.",11,[],6
1103.1820,quant-ph,"In this article we discuss and compare different ways to engineer an interface between ultracold atoms and micro- and nanomechanical oscillators. We start by analyzing a direct mechanical coupling of a single atom or ion to a mechanical oscillator and show that the very different masses of the two systems place a limit on the achievable coupling constant in this scheme. We then discuss several promising strategies for enhancing the coupling: collective enhancement by using a large number of atoms in an optical lattice in free space, coupling schemes based on high-finesse optical cavities, and coupling to atomic internal states. Throughout the manuscript we discuss both theoretical proposals and first experimental implementations.",11,['cond-mat'],6
1108.4842,quant-ph,"We report the implementation of a 3-qubit quantum error correction code (QECC) on a quantum information processor realized by the magnetic resonance of Carbon nuclei in a single crystal of Malonic Acid. The code corrects for phase errors induced on the qubits due to imperfect decoupling of the magnetic environment represented by nearby spins, as well as unwanted evolution under the internal Hamiltonian. We also experimentally demonstrate sufficiently high fidelity control to implement two rounds of quantum error correction. This is a demonstration of state-of-the-art control in solid state nuclear magnetic resonance, a leading test-bed for the implementation of quantum algorithms.",11,[],6
